Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students explore the popular culture phenomenon of the musical ‘Cats’ and the T.S. Eliot poems that were its inspiration. Students then write original poems about animals, and read them aloud to their peers.

Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Listen to a reading of one of the poems in T.S. Eliot’s “Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats” and respond by drawing their impressions.

2. Examine the popularity of the musical “Cats” through reading and discussing “The Last Meow: A Fence Sitter’s Summing Up.”

3. Brainstorm and write a rough draft of their own animal poems, then meet in small peer groups to read them aloud.

4. Conduct further research on their animal, and use new information to shape a second draft of the poem.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-classroom blackboard

-paper

-copies of “The Last Meow: A Fence Sitter’s Summing Up” (one per student)

-copies of at least one poem from Eliot’s “Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats” (these can be obtained at //www.kirtland.cc.mi.us/honors/possums.htm)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Read aloud one of the poems in “Old Possum’s Book of

Practical Cats” as the class listens. Ask students to respond in their journals by drawing something that relates to, or is inspired by, what they have heard. Volunteers then share their drawings and talk about the aspects of the poem they tried to capture. Ask students what they know about the musical “Cats” and its connection to T.S. Eliot’s poetry.

2. As a class, read and discuss “The Last Meow: A Fence Sitter’s Summing Up,” focusing on the following questions:

a. What is the tone of the opening paragraph of this piece? What does it lead you to expect from the rest of the review? How would you describe the overall tone of the article? Find lines that reveal the tone of the article especially well.

b. Why does this reviewer feel it may be unnecessary to see popular culture phenomena like “Cats”? Do you agree? Why or why not?

c. What complaints about the musical does this critic list? Why do you think “Cats” has “never been a critic’s show”?

d. What aspects of the show does the reviewer praise? How does the show “seduce the audience”?

e. How did “Cats” originally “set the standard” for the shows that transformed Broadway in the 1980’s? How has it evolved to “milk its shtick”?

f. How is there “democracy” in the “Cats” phenomenon?

g. What, finally, is the reviewer’s feeling about the value of “Cats”? Is the style and voice in which the article is written an effective way to convey this? Why or why not?

3. Have students each choose an animal on which to do some freewriting and brainstorming in their journals. Tell them that they may choose a specific animal they have known, such as a pet, or a kind of animal in general. Guide students in ten minutes of freewriting by asking them to write down everything they can think of about this animal. What does it look like? How does it move? What are its habits? What, when, where, and how does it eat, sleep, and play? What does it smell like? What does it feel like? What sounds does it make? When students have finished, ask them to look over their freewriting and underline those words or images that seem especially evocative of this animal. Now have them try crafting their thoughts into a poem of some sort, whether a simple list of images or a lengthy rhyming story like those in the “Old Possum” poems. After writing, students might meet in small peer groups to hear and respond to these first drafts. Before the class ends, the teacher might read “The Naming of Cats is a Difficult Matter” and ask students to consider what name their animal and/or poem should have.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Students research the animal they have chosen in some way (through observation of an actual animal, through interviewing someone who knows about this kind of animal, or through library or internet research). Students then incorporate new information into a second draft of their poem. Poems can be read in a class read-around the following day, or posted on a school bulletin board.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–What is the job of a reviewer? How have reviews influenced you in the past?

–What other popular culture phenomena can you identify? Why do you think these things were so popular?

–Are there any pop culture phenomena that you have ignored? If so, how much did you know about it anyway, simply because it “saturated” our culture?

–Have you ever been to the theater? How did you find the experience?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on their drawn responses to the Eliot poem, their participation in class and small group discussions, and the creation of first and final drafts of their own animal poems.

Vocabulary:

elitism, saturate, rudimentary, treacly, duress, nominal, unassailable, disavowed, fodder, chagrin, paradigm, fortuitous, progenitors, cogent, flaccid, obfuscating, anthropomorphisms, paean, shmaltz, obviating, detritus, proverbial, attenuate, palliated, stultifying

Extension Activities:

1. Adapt a favorite poem, story, play, novel, or other literary work for use in the musical theater. A poem or short story might be adapted as a song, while a novel or longer work might be recast as an entire Broadway musical. Look to famous adaptations–such as “Romeo and Juliet” as transformed into “West Side Story”– for inspiration.

2. What should theaters do to attract people your age and cultivate in them a lifelong love of theater? Create an ad campaign that would either convince your peers to visit the theater in general, or would attract them to some specific theatrical event in your school, community, or city.

3. What current popular culture craze that exists among your peers do you believe adults do not really understand? Write an editorial for your local paper in which you explain why this show, hobby, series, game, toy, or other phenomenon is so popular, and make a case for why it should be encouraged.

4. Collect a series of simple poems by different authors on the same subject-whether animals or anything else-and find or draw illustrations for each poem. Write an introduction to your “book” and donate it to an elementary school library or classroom.

5. How would T.S. Eliot himself respond to the phenomenon that is the musical “Cats”? Research to learn about T.S. Eliot, then write an imaginary interview in which he speaks his mind.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Research the history of theater in America to identify the most popular shows of the 20th century. Then create a timeline that names these shows, lists one or two other major national or world events from the same time, and provide a sentence or two of explanation as to why these shows were so popular.

Fine Arts- Research film and theater history to learn about the art of turning human actors into animals through costuming. Then design your own costume that would transform you into an animal of some kind.

Journalism- Compare and contrast this review with one of the original reviews of “Cats” that appeared in the early 1980s, the era in which it was “a hip, had-to-be-there ticket.” What does it tell you about how times and tastes change?

Mathematics- This review lists many odd facts about the show, such as “maintenance workers have removed 237 pounds of gum from Winter Garden seat bottoms.” Compile a series of odd or “goofy” statistics to document something long-running in your community. You might choose your school as a topic (How many plates of macaroni and cheese can you estimate have been served in your cafeteria? How many detentions given?) a local business, or even your own family.
