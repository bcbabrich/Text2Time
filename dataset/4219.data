Last Sunday, the 11 A.M. Polish-language Mass at St. Stanislaus Bishop and Martyr Church was jammed with a standing-room crowd of 500. It was attracted by the newly crowned Miss Polonia, who will represent the parish at today's Pulaski Day parade in Manhattan, and an afternoon raffle for tickets to Pope John Paul II's Mass at nearby Aqueduct race track on Friday.

The excitement in the church was palpable, but it was heightened by the fact that the parishioners actually had a church in which to worship.

Three weeks ago, St. Stanislaus Church, at 88-10 102d Avenue in Ozone Park, reopened after a suffering a devastating fire on June 20, 1994. There were no injuries, and firefighters extinguished the flames before they spread to the St. Stanislaus grammar school next door, but the ceiling of the 65-year-old church was destroyed, and there was extensive smoke and water damage.

"One of the priests called me at work and asked had I left any equipment in the church, that there had been a little fire," said Michael Zybrocki, 35, a systems analyst for Nynex, who plays the church's pipe organ and has led its choir for 15 years. "When I got off the subway after work, I couldn't believe it. There were hordes of people out in the street, crying and hugging each other."
