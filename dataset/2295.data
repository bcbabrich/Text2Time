In a Square you will find nothing that resembles an actual geometric square. In fact, the predominant shape is the triangle, as the intersection of many randomly generated roads would dictate. For drivers, Squares are nightmarish; because the roads rarely intersect at the exact same place, motorists can expect to encounter a confusing battery of traffic lights and signs every twenty yards or so. After running this gauntlet, Boston drivers can expect smooth sailing for roughly the next quarter of a mile, at which point they will come to another Square.

Harvard Square, Inman Square, and Central Square, the areas that we'll be primarily concerned with herein, all exist quite close to one another in Cambridge, Massachusetts. They are, naturally, made of triangles. Taken as a group, they form something of a triangle themselves (as is the wont of any three points). Not an isosceles triangle, mind you, but a stable and powerful shape nonetheless. Inman and Central are a bit closer to each other, linked by Prospect Street. Harvard is slightly farther off, to the west, linked to Inman and Central by Cambridge Street and Mass Ave, respectively.

On a map, if you look at the triangle formed by these three Squares, you might note that the shape they describe is a triangle with one dramatically acute angle, the one emanating from Harvard Square. The angle is sharp enough that the triangle looks very much like an arrowhead. If you owned a map of the entire United States big enough and detailed enough to depict the street-level configuration of this tiny section of Massachusetts-a map that would by necessity be approximately the size of your living room-you would be able to see exactly what this arrowhead is pointing at.

It's pointing, more or less, directly at Montana.

The President of Montana slumps low behind his desk and waits for the gunshots to stop. No doubt about it, the assassin's dead out there, but there's still a whole lot of risk from friendly fire. Dixon probably won't stop until he pumps thirty rounds into the pile of flesh that was a man thirty seconds ago.

There's a small corner of the President's mind that wonders if all the assassins that have come around here lately were actually assassins at all. By the time the President sees them, there's really not that much that can be done in the way of interrogation. They could be just ordinary visitors, couldn't they? Salesmen and milkmen and such. But why would Dixon shoot the milkman? the President wonders. No reason that he can see. Dixon likes milk.

Dixon comes in and sits in front of the President's desk. The President looks at his Secretary of Defense, watches him without moving. Dixon watches back. They spend a long while watching. The President is aware that Dixon is looking at a fiftyish "white" man whose lean, youthful pallor has given way to a fleshy, mottled, embarrassing red-the kind of red that lets everyone know that all efforts to lay off the salty fried food have been unsuccessful. The President also can't understand why Dix seems to look the same way he did when they were twenty-five.

It's not a good moment, from the Chief Executive's point of view. Finally, the President speaks.

"Assassin?"

"Yep."

More watching. They've been friends since they were small, but the President feels like these quiet staring times have been getting longer lately. Hell, friends don't need to talk. That's how you know it's a friend. But these silences have been getting ... tense. Ever since he took the Oath of Office.

"Damn, I'm hungry! Could you ask Retta to fix me a big bowl of cornflakes with bananas? Could you do that for me, Dix? I got a lot of paperwork to do. . . ."

"Can't do that, Mr. President."

"Why not?"

"No milk."

"We're out of milk?"

"Yep."

Now, suddenly, the President of Montana is scared.

Johnny's first thought after the noise and the blood started was how incredibly clichÈ it was to have one's gun go off while one was cleaning it. Then he bled to death, realizing all the while that that, too, had been done before. Done to death, he thought. Ha-ha.

Fortunately, or unfortunately, no one came down to the basement for three days after that, so Johnny Felix Decaté didn't actually die until his grandmother opened the basement door three days later. Well, really, he was dead long before that. But not really. It's hard to explain.

Dr. Schrödinger was trying to explain quantum physics.

"Imagine if you will," he said, "a cat in a box with a vial of deadly gaseous poison which may or may not have been bro- ken by a trip-hammer before you open the box." Everyone imagined this. "Now let me tell you that, in terms of particles, the cat is neither alive nor dead until you open that box, but it is in fact simultaneously alive and dead AND neither alive nor dead until a human observes it!" Everyone was thrilled. Captivated.

"Only in terms of particles and waves, of course," continued Dr. Schrödinger. "I'm not talking about a real cat, of course. And this is somewhat of a counterexample." No one was listening anymore, the idea was too grand. "Really," plied the doctor, aware that he was losing his audience, "we're talking about subatomic particles here, not cats. Not cats. Please, let's forget about the cat, okay?"

By this time, Dr. Schrödinger had pushed everyone a bit too far, and he was given his coat and shown to the door, still grumbling something about being misunderstood.

In a small one-bedroom apartment in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Deborah Johnstone is having an orgasm.

Johnny Felix Decaté was in a bar. This was several hours after he accidentally shot and killed himself. But he hadn't been found yet, so he wasn't actually dead-he was both alive and dead, and neither alive nor dead, and he was drinking a beer. Being dead wasn't a problem at the moment; it was just an eigenstate.

We called Dr. Schrödinger on the telephone to find out about these eigenstates. He was eager to oblige us. Frankly, he seemed a little lonely. He started to talk about subatomic particles, but we played dumb so that he would talk about the cat and the box. He then explained it like this:

"When I say that the 'cat' is both alive and dead before human observation intervenes, I mean it. It has the properties of both a dead thing and a living thing. At that point, it is said to exist simultaneously in two opposing eigenstates: alive and dead. At the moment of observation, it retains all the properties of one of the eigenstates and loses all of the other's. The cat becomes either truly alive or truly dead."

Then Dr. Schrödinger let us know that this only applies to subatomic physics, that we should substitute "particle" and "wave" for "alive" and "dead," that, tellingly, complex physical systems don't behave with the same indeterminacy.

"How would you know?" we ask, and he gets very quiet for a moment. Just enough time for us to hang up on the tiresome old codger.

Deborah Johnstone is still having an orgasm in Cambridge. The same orgasm. She is sitting upright, straddled across a man, her head is thrown back, and rivulets of sweat are running down her neck. Her eyes are closed, her jaw is clenched, and her body jerks and flails spasmodically.

Deborah has been having this orgasm for three minutes, and it's a very powerful orgasm, and it shows no sign of abating. In fact, it's intensifying, all of her soft but strong nether muscles convulsing in an uncontrollable spastic rhythm as a low, open-mouthed moan dances around the very back of her throat. Bear all this in mind. . . .
