The Jets, who turned the ball over 34 times last season, have apparently learned to hold on to the ball.

The reason? Some players today attribute it to ''concentration.'' Others said special practice techniques have helped. Whatever, the Jets have dramatically reduced their turnover rate and it is one reason they are riding a three-game winning streak and share first place in the American Football Conference's Eastern Division with the Miami Dolphins.

Because the Jets are not a big-play team, a team that can just roll over the opposition, turnovers take on added importance. They lost the ball on fumbles 13 times last season, and 21 times on interceptions.

These are some of the Jets' statistics so far this season:

* Only one lost fumble in 298 offensive plays and kick returns.

* Ken O'Brien has thrown 81 straight passes over three games without an interception, the best mark by a Jets' quarterback since 1981. He was intercepted twice in the season opener.
