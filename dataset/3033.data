Good plots and graceful writing count for a lot in the traditional English police procedural, but so do those idiosyncratic touches that keep us coming back to Cynthia Harrod-Eagles's series with Inspector Bill Slider and his colleagues in Shepherd's Bush. In GONE TOMORROW (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's Minotaur, $24.95), everyone in Slider's residential neighborhood seems to have what one detective refers to as ''a sensayuma,'' including the villain who stabs a local lowlife to death and leaves his body dangling from a children's playground swing. If that doesn't tickle your funny bone, how about this image of another victim, strangled with a thick chain and padlock left draped on his chest, ''as if they'd made him lord mayor of some very industrial city''?

To underscore the dry but distinctly morbid wit of this series, Slider and company also fool with brainy puns, slang and other wordplay, which keeps them sane when it becomes evident here that some big-time criminal is knocking off all the small-time competition. Just as admirable when she plays it straight, Harrod-Eagles has a discerning eye and sympathetic ear for the petty thieves, dope dealers and other bad apples (not to mention a certain shifty lawyer with ''a mind like the labyrinth of Knossos'') who collectively foul the social barrel but don't deserve killing.

If there's a lesson to be had from Amanda Cross's thoughtful mystery THE EDGE OF DOOM (Ballantine, $22.95), it's that you should never count yourself out before the bell rings. Kate Fansler, the literary scholar and sleuth in Cross's intellectually lively academic mysteries, ''had some time ago come to the dreary conclusion that life could no longer offer the unexpected.'' Well, that's just begging for the shock that Kate gets when the eldest and stuffiest of her three insufferable brothers summons her to his Manhattan club to announce that a strange man with lovely manners has appeared to claim her as his natural daughter. While the paternity mystery is easily resolved through science and logic, Kate is rattled by other issues that emerge during the investigation into her origins, from the existential implications about the formation of her character to the possibility that someone in her family was involved in a long-ago art fraud. But Amanda Cross being who she is in real life (the literary scholar Carolyn G. Heilbrun), the most rousing aspect of this static exercise in introspection is the running commentary on Shakespeare's father-daughter relationships.

When, exactly, do you give up on a book? Do you hang in there with Boston Teran all the way to the bitter end of THE PRINCE OF DEADLY WEAPONS (St. Martin's Minotaur, $24.95), only to find out that key plot points are never going to be resolved; that, in fact, the story ends on an open question? Do you bail out midway, once it becomes obvious that a pivotal character will never speak in anything but riddles? Or maybe you're smart enough to pack it in after a couple of chapters of ripe prose, tortured metaphors and convoluted sentence construction.

Unlike the weirdos who hot-wired Teran's ''God Is a Bullet'' and ''Never Count Out the Dead'' with their insane energy, the characters in this soggy narrative are a sneaky, sullen lot given to pointless speculation about the death of a well-beloved son. Everyone perks up when an enigmatic young stranger who seems to have all the answers shows up for the memorial service in Sacramento. But with his talent for killing conversation by gazing off into the middle distance to ponder ''the heartbreaking and beautiful contradictions of untamed and invincible forces,'' this stripling manages to outdo the whole gang in obscurity -- and pretentiousness.
