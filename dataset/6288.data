UNITED NATIONS, N. Y., Dec. 1—Britain today suggested a renewal of negotiating efforts toward reopening the Suez Canal.

Sir Colin Crowe, the British Permanent Representative here, declared in the General Assembly that such arrangements—if accepted by Egypt and Israel—could “unlock the door” to an eventual settlement in the Middle East.

The United States last year actively pressed both countries to accept an interim arrangement involving the holding of indirect, or “proximity,” talks in New York. Today an American official said that the offer “still stands.”

But Egypt's Foreign Minister, Dr. Mohammed H. El‐Zayyat, said that he had no indication of any new initiatives being considered by Washington, although there have been reports of such moves in recent days.
