A British logistics and recruiting business, Hays, said its full-year pretax profit could be as low as $294 million, 15 percent less than market expectations, in the year through June 2003. The warning sent Hays's shares falling by as much as 28 percent, to 80 pence ($1.25), the lowest in more than seven years. The company blamed tough economic conditions for the setback.
