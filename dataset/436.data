RETREATS

Malibu and the areas surrounding it are home to a handful of renowned but challenging weight-loss retreats where guests hike for several hours a day and stick to a low-calorie, vegetarian diet. Aja Malibu, opening June 20, wants to offer health-seekers a less aggressive way to achieve their goals. Nestled on a 23-acre knoll in the Santa Monica Mountains, the property accommodates just seven people at a time.

Guests begin their day with a smoothie and a 90-minute hike, and throughout the day, they take part in nutrition workshops, classes on healthy cooking using produce and herbs grown in the expansive gardens, meditation sessions and treatments in a spa adorned with healing crystals. They can also use a sound-healing room and a swimming pool filled with filtered, chlorine-free water. The meals, shakes and snacks are all plant-based and gluten- and dairy-free, but the portions are generous, and there is no calorie counting. “We believe that transformation, including weight loss, can happen with our holistic approach,” said Airrion Copeland, the general manager. Prices from $10,000 for seven nights, all inclusive.
