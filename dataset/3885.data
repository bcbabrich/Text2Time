TRAMPLER-Walter. The Board of Directors, Artists and Staff of The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center mourn the loss of our beloved colleague and friend Walter Trampler. A distinguished violist and founding Artist Member of the Chamber Music Society, Walter delighted our audiences for 25 seasons. His long and extraordinary career as a soloist and chamber musician profoundly influenced the art of string playing. His passionate commitment to new music helped significantly to expand the chamber music repertoire and to strengthen the viola's prominence as a solo and ensemble instrument. Walter's stately presence will be missed by all. We extend our sincere condolences to his family and friends. Donaldson C. Pillsbury, Chairman Mrs. John D. Coffin, President David Shifrin, Artistic Director Jacqueline M. Taylor, Executive Director Charles Wadsworth, Founding Artistic Director
