Responding to intelligence information from federal authorities about a possible terrorist attack on New York Harbor, the United States Coast Guard closed the Port of New York to pleasure craft yesterday and, along with the New York Police Department, increased harbor patrols.

Several senior law enforcement officials in New York played down the significance of the threat, which came amid heightened security for the New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square. One official said the action was taken out of an ''abundance of caution,'' and another described the intelligence information as ''nonspecific, uncorroborated and of unknown reliability.''

Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, speaking at a news conference in Times Square yesterday afternoon to discuss the New Year's Eve festivities there, said in response to a question that the actions were simply prudent in an age of increased risk.

''I can tell you that there are no credible threats that we know of to our security here,'' he said. ''But New York and the N.Y.P.D. is in the business of prevention, and we take all the appropriate precautions that we should when you have large numbers of people get together.''
