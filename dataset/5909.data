The fragmentation of poor black families is an undeniable and unhappy fact of life that burdens all society. For years, however, black leaders resisted direct efforts to help the black family by arguing that the real issue was racism.

That seems to be changing, especially as pregnancy among unwed minority teen-agers increases alarmingly. ''Repair of the black family is central to any serious strategy to improve the black condition,'' says Eleanor Holmes Norton, former head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

The National Urban League now supports local programs to reduce teen-age pregnancies. And a group of black scholars and civil rights leaders urges that Government redesign welfare programs so that they lead poor families toward economic independence.

Just how that might be done is far from obvious - and would be a worthy topic for debate in the 1984 campaign. But one model set up by the Manpower Development Research Corporation and supported by the Labor Department and Ford Foundation is worth a close look.
