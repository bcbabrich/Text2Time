''The question is how far will the reader want to go,'' Mr. Straus said. ''The answer, I think, is far, not only because of his reputation but because of his writing persona, his style.''

The first version of ''August 1914'' was published in Russian while Mr. Solzhenitsyn was still in the Soviet Union. After his exile in 1974, when he was doing research at the Hoover Institution in California, he came across new material about Czar Nicholas and his Prime Minister, Pyotr A. Stolypin, whose correspondence is in the Hoover archives.

Much of the revised book's new material deals with Stolypin, an imposing figure regarded by many historians as Russia's last best hope for reform - mainly agricultural reform - when the czarist regime was swinging violently between war and revolution.

The book offers a dramatic account of Stolypin's assassination in Kiev in September 1911, told from different perspectives, including that of the assassin, Dmitri Bogrov, a young Jewish anarchist who had also been a police informer.

When they were first published in Russian by the Y.M.C.A. press in Paris in 1983, these new chapters sparked arguments about Mr. Solzhenitsyn's views on history, his brand of Russian nationalism and his penchant for a strong, reforming autocracy, as contrasted to what he describes as the irresponsible opinions of liberal ''society.'' His unabashed idolization of Stolypin - described as almost saintly in his selfless devotion to Russia, the Russian Orthodox Church and the monarchy - was seen by some critics as evidence that Mr. Solzhenitsyn's version of history was too biased to be credible.

Some historians dismiss these views as irrelevant. ''A lot of 'War and Peace' was not history either,'' said Alexander Riazanovsky, a professor of Russian history at the University of Pennsylvania, ''but I think Mr. Solzhenitsyn tends to capture more than just history.'' Besides, he added, ''what account of the Russian Revolution is not opinionated?''

Adam Ulam, director of the Russian Research Center at Harvard University, praised Mr. Solzhenitsyn's ''truly astounding'' capacity to digest historical material. ''He has his point of view, which is legitimate, if obviously partisan, because it is enormously well researched,'' Mr. Ulam said. ''At a certain point, he ceases to be a novelist and becomes a chronicler.''
