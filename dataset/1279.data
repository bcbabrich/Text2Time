Sandy Alderson, the Mets’ general manager, said the only time he had been recognized since coming to New York was when a Transportation Security Administration agent noticed him at La Guardia Airport. Now he is the face of the Mets’ rehabilitation effort.

Alderson recalled the story Tuesday at Fordham University’s Lincoln Center campus during a question-and-answer session, which raised money for prostate cancer awareness and education. He also addressed other topics — including the organization’s financial uncertainty — but did not field questions from the crowd of roughly 75.

“I haven’t heard much, but that doesn’t mean people aren’t feeling various concerns or emotions,” Alderson said of the fans’ concerns. “I haven’t heard that much. But I haven’t been on the street that much. Nobody has; it’s been snowing.”

It was an important moment for Alderson, who was making his first public appearance since the Mets owners Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz said they were seeking minority partners in the wake of a lawsuit that could cost them hundreds of millions of dollars as fallout from the Ponzi scheme orchestrated by Bernard L. Madoff. Alderson, who is widely respected in baseball, has emerged as perhaps the most important and credible member of the Mets’ front office. He said he believed Wilpon and Katz would retain control of the team.

But the uncertainty will surely make for a rough indoctrination for Alderson, who was hired in October to replace Omar Minaya. Though Alderson’s résumé might be lustrous — he is a former Marine and a graduate of Harvard Law School — he will have to convince fans that the turmoil will not upset trying to build a winning team.

“The unfortunate thing is regardless of what we do, there will be a perception that has to be taken into account,” Alderson said, noting the team’s inactivity this off-season. “All I can do is move forward based off my judgment about baseball wisdom of this decision or that decision.”

The interviewer, the broadcaster Ed Randall, who also organized the function, asked Alderson about his personal background and his thoughts on baseball topics in the wide-ranging conversation.

But Alderson also touched on the massive contracts still owed to Oliver Perez and Luis Castillo (both will have to earn their spots in spring training), possibly changing the dimensions of Citi Field, and the decision to hire Manager Terry Collins (the right man for the job at the present time).

For Mets’ fans — who applauded to show their approval for the knuckleballer R. A. Dickey and the notion of getting rid of Perez and Catillo — the primary concern was still about the team’s direction.

“He’s a sign of hope,” George Simone, a 34-year-old from Queens, said of Alderson. “But where they’re coming from, can you believe what they’re saying? They’ve been lying about the Madoff stuff for two years. Why should we believe what they’re saying.”

Wearing a dark pinstripe suit and snow boots, Alderson projected an air of confidence as he sat on the dais alongside Randall. Alderson even playfully joked several times about the Mets’ current state, at one point saying he would favor an expanded playoff format, with another wild-card team, “in my current situation.”

As Alderson takes the lead of an embattled franchise, his current situation is indeed a challenging one.
