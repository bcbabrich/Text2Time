Worshipers picked their way with care past the scaffolding that enveloped the crumbling brownstone facade of Brooklyn's First Unitarian Church. Indoors, the church was splendidly decorated with branches of fir and illuminated by tall wax candles and gas-lighted tapers. Best of all, there was the music from the organ.

For a time, it was doubtful that the ailing pipe organ could be coaxed into performing but Larry Trupiano, one of the few remaining pipe organ builders in the city, had made a house call and put his skills to work. This was his gift to the church: music for the holidays.

Major work remains to be done on the 93-year-old organ, and the congregation will have to pay for it. But it will get help paying for other desperately needed repairs at the 150-year-old church because of a grant from the New York Landmark Conservancy, which has awarded $105,000 to help preserve 27 congregations across the state.

And the conservancy's effort, known as the Sacred Sites and Properties Fund, itself will benefit from a $120,000 gift recently announced by Henry Luce 3d, chairman of the Henry Luce Foundation. The gift is the philanthropy's third contribution in support of the sacred sites fund, which assists congregations of all religious denominations.
