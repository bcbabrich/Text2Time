The New York Times Company said on Friday that it had sold more than half of its minority ownership in the Boston Red Sox and several other sports properties.

The company sold 390 of the 700 Class B units of the Fenway Sports Group that it owned to three separate buyers in a deal for $117 million. The company, which did not disclose the buyers, expects to record a pretax gain of about $64 million in the third quarter because of the sale.

The sale leaves the company with 310 shares, or about a 7 percent stake, in the Fenway Sports Group. It said it was also exploring selling those shares. Fenway owns the Red Sox; the Liverpool Football Club; about 80 percent of the New England Sports Network, a regional cable sports network that televises the Red Sox and Boston Bruins hockey games; and 50 percent of Roush Fenway Racing, a leading Nascar team.

About a year ago, the company sold 50 shares to Henry F. McCance, a venture capitalist.

In 2002, the company paid $75 million for 17.75 percent ownership in Fenway. But in 2008, faced with a deep recession and pressure to sell noncore assets, it began looking for someone to buy its stake as a way to generate cash.

The Times Company owns other interests throughout New England, including The Boston Globe, The Worcester Telegram & Gazette and Boston.com.
