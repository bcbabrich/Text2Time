California officials complained on Friday that the state's plea for $430 million to clear forests of dead and damaged trees that helped fuel the fires had been ignored for months and then turned down by the federal government just as the worst of the fires were beginning.

And in San Diego, sheriff's department pilots said they might have been able to slow the spread of the Cedar fire last Saturday if they had not been stopped by United States Forest Service rules that prohibit airborne firefighting operations at night.

Governor Davis sent an urgent plea to the Federal Emergency Management Agency in April seeking the money to try to prevent catastrophic fires. He noted that more than 400,000 acres of Southern California woodlands were filled with trees killed by four years of drought and a bark beetle infestation, which posed an imminent fire hazard to 75,000 residents and nearby urban areas.

The federal agency did not respond until last Friday, when it turned down the request, saying the state was already receiving $45 million from various federal agencies to deal with the threat. The Old fire in San Bernardino National Forest erupted on Saturday morning. It has consumed more than 90,000 acres and left four people dead.

Mr. Davis refrained from directly criticizing the agency or its director, Michael D. Brown, who visited the state earlier this week to assess the damage and discuss federal relief efforts. ''We're not in the blame game here,'' Mr. Davis said. ''Our task is still to put the fires out and put the victims back on their feet.''

Dallas Jones, director of the state Office of Emergency Services, acknowledged that the thinning of the forest had been slowed by a lack of money, exacerbating the fires. Asked directly whether the federal money would have made a difference, he replied, ''I believe it would have.''

Also on Friday, two San Diego County helicopter pilots said the United States Forest Service had refused them permission to drop water on the devastating Cedar fire shortly after it started at 5:37 p.m. Saturday.
