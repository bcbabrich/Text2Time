The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum paid posthumous tribute yesterday to Oskar Schindler, the German industrialist and Nazi Party member who saved the lives of 1,300 Jews in the Holocaust.

At a ceremony in the museum, in Washington, the Medal of Remembrance was presented to his widow, EMILIE SCHINDLER, 84, who worked with her husband to rescue Jews from concentration camps and to shelter many in a bogus munitions factory. Steven Spielberg has made the story into the film "Schindler's List," which opens Dec. 15.

MILES LERMAN, the chairman of the museum council, said Mr. Schindler, who died in 1974, was a "most unlikely candidate" to save so many Jews. He described Mr. Schindler, a bon vivant, as someone whose original ambition had been "to make lots and lots of money." He said, "He had everything to gain from the Nazis." Instead, he risked his freedom and depleted his fortune.

Mr. Spielberg, another of the speakers, recounted how Mrs. Schindler once discovered a boxcar full of victims of the Nazis. They all appeared to have frozen to death, but still she combed through the bodies. She found 30 people who were barely alive and nursed them back to health.
