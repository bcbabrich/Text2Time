Chuck has been training hard for months now. He’s put on a few pounds of what might conceivably be muscle. He’s in the shape of his life.

On Tuesday, when the big moment comes, Chuck will be ready, his trainer says. He will not mess up this time.

Because if Chuck bites the mayor again, he and his trainer may both be finished.

Chuck, of course, is the Staten Island Zoo’s resident groundhog, whose annual photo op turned into a YouTube moment last year when he took a chunk out of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s leather glove and index finger.

Chuck’s trainer, Douglas Schwartz, still maintains that the mayor brought the attack on himself. Chuck was in one of his moods last year, and he did not want to come out of his wooden cage, so the mayor impatiently grabbed him by the belly. Chomp.

This year, Mr. Schwartz said Monday, “the rule is that nobody else will try to pick him up first — usually I try to pick him up.”

But in the heat of the moment, the mayor can no more easily be controlled than can a 15-pound, 4-year-old groundhog. And if Mr. Schwartz has learned anything in his 13-plus years as a city employee, it is that the boss is always right. He is ready for any eventuality.

“When it’s the mayor, he’s the center of attention,” he said. “You can’t be giving the mayor orders.”

That Chuck is being given a second chance at all is a bit of a surprise. Last year, the zoo’s executive director, John J. Caltabiano, said that the zoo was casting for a replacement. But Chuck is back, and Mr. Schwartz said had faith in his charge.

“I’ve really been spending a lot of time with him -– hands-on in a real sense,” he said. Once again, he offered his word as a showbiz veteran. “He is a professional, and I’m a professional.”
