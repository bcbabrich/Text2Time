These joint exhibitions compare Jack Whitten's paintings from two decades ago with his current efforts, and find them consistent. Mr. Whitten has stuck to his ambition, shared with many others in the late 1960's and 70's, to push painting and paint beyond the limits of the hand and brush. This approach, which combined a lot of Minimalist predetermination with a little post-Minimalist randomness, was probably inspired by Frank Stella's famous defense that "what you see is what you see."

With their fields of fine horizontal lines and textures, usually achieved by drawing a wide broom across the canvas, Mr. Whitten's 70's paintings present sauve, understated unities. Their blurry surfaces suggest television static when executed in black and white, or erased abstract paintings when muted browns and reds are used. In the latter, the pulled fields sometimes break, revealing random strokes. Their resemblance to some of Gerhard Richter's early paintings, and to the more current efforts of John Zinsser and Stephen Ellis, is startling, and a reminder that history is less single and linear than multiple and circular.

At Horodner Romley, Mr. Whitten's researches into the possibilities of paint have lead him to freeze strips of acrylic and then break them into little bits that resemble ceramic tile and can be formed into paintings that resemble mosaics. In a series of small canvases, the designs are based on the forms of popcorn; in a much larger work, a fleet of colorful circles and ellipses on a white ground has been inspired by buttons. There is something both witty and contrived about all this, with only the button painting seeming worth the trouble.
