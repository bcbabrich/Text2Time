Mr. Carter said that the existing welfare structure was “worse than we thought.”

The “many separate programs, taken together, still do not constitute a rational, coherent system that is adequate and fair for all the poor,” he said. “They are still overly wasteful, capricious and subject to fraud. They violate many desirable and necessary principles.”

Mr. Carter said that he would send Congress specific welfare legislation the first week in August. Even if the measure can be enacted early next year, he said, “an additional three years will be required to implement the program.”

The President implied, however, that it might be impossible for Congress to act next year. He said that energy legislation was his “first priority for Congress,” and other forthcoming proposals, including those that would revise the tax and Social Security laws, would have to he considered by the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees, the same panels that have jurisdiction over welfare measures and most of the energy package.

“I'll have to depend on Congressional leaders to decide in which order they will address these measures,” the President said. He said that the welfare bill to be proposed in August would meet the following 12 goals:

¶No higher initial cost than the present system.

¶Access to a job for at least one member of every family with children where there is a person able to work.

¶Incentives for those on welfare to take jobs in the private sector.

¶Public training and employment for those able to work who cannot find private jobs.

¶A higher income for families who work than for those who do not.

¶Incentives for families to stay together.

¶A continuation of tax credits to the working poor. (IA single cash payment to replace existing welfare programs.
