One section of the bill whose effects were uncovered yesterday would increase, in some circumstances, the pensions of officials who remained in office after the age of 70. It would do this by, in effect, freezing the money reserves on which the pension was based when the employee became 70, rather than letting it continue to decline, as was now the case.

This is the section that could, in theory affect Mr. Levitt and Mr. Lefkowitz if they retired and selected certain pension options. Both men denied having encouraged the measure or having any knowledge of it, and said it had no relevance, because they had no current plans to retire.

Its primary beneficiaries, according to sources, would be a number of judges, who routinely remain in their posts after the age of 70. Precisely how many would be affected by the change, and how much such a change would cost, could not be ascertained yesterday.

Another section would in essence allow the New York City Conciliation and Appeals Board—the hearing officers, for disputes involving the city's rent‐stablilization system — to be classified as a municipality, giving its employees the right to join the state's employee‐retirement system.

This provision would allow Mr. Gribetz, who served on the board for four years, to take that additional credit for state service, which would have some effect on his eventual pension. Mr. Gribetz said yesterday that he was unaware of the measure until the time it was introduced, and criticized the way it was done.

“I didn't ask for it, and I didn't know about it,” Mr. Gribetz said. “If they want to add these people to the retirement system, it ought to be done openly, not within a salary bill.”

He said the provision would affect about 100 people other than himself, and that many of them were not currently covered by any pension plan.
