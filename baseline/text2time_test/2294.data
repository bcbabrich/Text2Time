LOW TIDE IN A MANGROVE FOREST, BAKO NATIONAL PARK, BORNEO, MALAYSIA, July 6, 2006 Tory Grice, 29, of Brisbane, Australia, a science communicator for the Queensland Environmental Protection Agency: This was my first overseas holiday, so it was super- exciting. Im a big animal person and bird-watcher, so Borneo felt like the ideal place to go. It still seems like a far-off, exotic land even though its quite close to Australia. That afternoon my boyfriend, Andrew, was having a snooze, so I got my binoculars and camera and went for a wander. I got fantastic photos of the mangroves in silhouette, with the sun setting behind them, and saw some woodpeckers, which we dont have in Australia. I actually found Andrew half an hour later: he was filming monkeys fighting on the beach. More of a boys thing. I know Ive got nothing to compare it to because it was my first holiday, but it was just so excellent. As told to Seth Kugel
