Mr. Cimino said the statues on display include not only ex-governors, but also other prominent Connecticut residents, such as the founder of Hartford, Thomas Hooker.

The last statue put into one of the niches was in the 1930's, Father Devine said, and the decision to include Mrs. Grasso's likeness was influended by her having been the first woman to be elected governor in the United States in her own right.

In February 1981, Mrs. Grasso succumbed to cancer, after six years as Governor, and by the following September the nonprofit, 14-member statue committee had been formed to raise funds for, and commission, a statue of Mrs. Grasso.

''From the start, there was bipartisan support of the committee's efforts,'' Father Devine said. The majority and minority leaders of both houses of the General Assembly, for instance, were named to the statue committee.

After drafting preliminary specifications for the statue, such as the type of material to be used and its rough dimensions, Father Devine said, the committee issued a request for proposals, and 64 artists responded, with bids ranging from $50,000 to $100,000.

The best artist for the job, Father Devine said, was found to be a sculptor in Barre, Vt., Frank C. Gaylord 2d, who was commissioned to do a bust of Mrs. Grasso, then a half-scale model, and finally a full-scale model.

Mr. Gaylord, who said he never met Mrs. Grasso, said he made his original proposal after interviewing dozens of people who knew her, viewing hundreds of photographs of her, and reading two of her biographies.
