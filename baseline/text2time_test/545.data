LOS ANGELES — The celebrated musical “La La Land,” which begins its theatrical run next week, is expected to be a force in multiple Oscar races, including for best picture, but not least for best actor and best actress. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone so perfectly inhabit their melancholy characters, or so the chatter on the fall awards circuit is going, that they were born to play the roles.

They almost didn’t get them.

As the film was coming together in late 2014, Lionsgate, the studio behind “La La Land,” said that the leads — difficult roles requiring singing, dancing and dramatic emotional swings — had gone to Miles Teller, then generating buzz for playing a tortured drummer in “Whiplash,” and Emma Watson, best known as Hermione in the “Harry Potter” movies.

“La La Land,” directed and written by Damien Chazelle, would have been a big deal for both young stars. Ms. Watson had been keen to finally discard her Hogwarts uniform. For Mr. Teller, the musical would have been a move toward above-the-title leading man territory.

But the movie gods had other plans — offering a prime example, as Hollywood hurtles into its annual awards hoopla, of the messy confluence of ephemeral factors that make some films sizzle.
