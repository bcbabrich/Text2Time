When a partnership overbids a little, the declarer must hope for a combination of skill and luck to save him. On the diagramed deal from the Cavendish Teams at the beginning of May it might seem that North-South should be content to play a minor-suit part-score. But when Sam Lev and Jim Rosenbloom sat North-South they climbed optimistically to five diamonds, and South performed a minor miracle by making 11 tricks after an opening heart lead. [ DIAGRAM ]

A spade was thrown from the dummy, and East's queen was captured with the ace. The club queen was led for a winning finesse, and a heart was ruffed. A spade was led to the ten, and West took the queen and led another heart. South ruffed again in dummy, threw a spade on the club ace and ruffed a club. East threw a spade on this trick, so the position was now this: [ DIAGRAM ]

Needing five more tricks, Rosenbloom led the spade king, pinning the jack and winning the trick when West erred by refusing to cover. He cashed the diamond ace, ruffed yet another heart and led a club. He could not then be prevented from scoring the diamond nine as his 11th trick. In practice East ruffed, and the spade nine was discarded.
