A celebration of spinning vinyl and twirling teenagers, “Northern Soul” captures a brief, blazing moment in 1970s England when the passionate lyrics and addictive beats of American soul ignited dance floors and working-class dreams.

Two dreamers take center stage. John (Elliot James Langridge), a high school misfit and all-around mope, is dazzled and flattered when Matt (Joshua Whitehouse), a skinny show-off and virtual orphan, befriends him at the youth club. Introduced to flared trousers and flashy dance moves — with a side order of aggro and amphetamines — John is soon a willing member of the cult of rare recordings.

Funny and feisty, gritty and sometimes grim, this first feature from the photographer Elaine Constantine delivers a sweaty snapshot of a very specific time and place. Surrounded by industrial drabness, the dance halls of Lancashire pulse with light and movement. Squeaky-clean pop is fading, and disco is waiting in the wings, but for these kids, it’s Edwin Starr and Frankie Valli who offer escape from sausage factory futures and nagging parents.

Performed with loose energy and studded with beautifully observant moments — like the worn spot on the hideous bedroom carpet where John practices his spins — “Northern Soul” suffers most from a lack of dramatic focus and a tendency to elbow women out of the frame. There’s tragedy, and there is disillusion, but Ms. Constantine’s writing is no match for her empathy and ability to conjure atmosphere. That said, the songs are smashing and the stomping joy infectious, smoothly summoning the way music can inject hope into the bleakest of lives.
