NANCY REAGAN has videotaped public service announcements for the Alzheimer's Association and the National Institute of Aging, her office announced yesterday. Her husband, former President Reagan, disclosed in November that he had Alzheimer's, the progressive, irreversible neurological disorder that affects four million Americans.

"When she was diagnosed with breast cancer years ago, her public disclosure led many individuals to undergo testing," CATHY BUSCH, a spokeswoman for the Reagans, said in a statement yesterday. "As a result, they were treated early and were able to resume healthy lives. Mrs. Reagan felt it was important to reach out again, this time to the many victims and families who have been touched by Alzheimer's -- and to reassure them that they are not alone." NADINE BROZAN
