And so Doug Williams transformed his burden into a blessing. Quarterbacks wear the smallest shoulder pads. For a passer, it's always more important to throw a football than a block. His arm can't be encumbered by too much equipment. But as Super Bowl XXII evolved yesterday, Williams and Elway each needed sturdier shoulder pads. Each was performing with a different and dramatic burden. Elway was trying to downplay his reputation as a ''one-man team'' while Williams was trying to downplay his historic significance.

''I don't think the Redskins brought me in to be the first black quarterback to be in the Super bowl,'' he said. ''They brought me in to be the quarterback of the Redskins.''

As it turned out, the Redskins also brought Williams to a dentist's office here Saturday, the first Super Bowl quarterback to undergo root-canal work 24 hours before the game.

''I was in there for three hours,'' Williams said. ''But during the game, I never thought about it.'' Of the two, only Elway had a previous Super Bowl experience: the Broncos' 39-20 loss to the Giants a year ago. The lingering embarrassment of that defeat served to alter Elway's approach to yesterday's game, as it did with all the Broncos who didn't want to risk losing again. But for a quarterback of his stature, Elway knew that another Super Bowl loss would create even a bigger burden for him.

''I guarantee you,'' he said during the week, ''that if we lose again, some people will say that we can't win the big ones. That's why we look at it as a 'must-win' game.''

In contrast to Elway's scrambling style, Williams is an old-fashioned drop-back passer who prefers to remain inside his convoy of blockers. He also prefers to minimize his sociological status. But he remembered being prepared for his potential role by Eddie Robinson, the coach at Grambling University, a predominantly black school.

''Coach Rob just told me,'' he recalled, ''to be a good American, be a good citizen.''

The relationship of Williams and the Redskin coach, Joe Gibbs, goes back to before the Tampa Bay Bucs selected Williams in the first round of th 1978 draft. Gibbs, then on the Buc staff, visited Williams, then a substitute teacher in Louisisana.
