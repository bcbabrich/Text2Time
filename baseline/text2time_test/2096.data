On paper, Hyung-Taik Lee was an unimposing roadblock for Andy Murray. Lee, a relatively stocky 31-year-old from South Korea, barely plays .500 ball. His career main-tour record coming into his match with Murray, the 19th-seeded British No. 1, was 141-141; Murray’s was 81-44.

But matches aren’t played on paper. Their match this evening was being played on a hard court, and Lee had reason to think he could win. When they met in San Jose earlier this year on a hard court, the match went the distance, with Murray winning in a third-set tiebreaker.

This time, on the bigger stage, Lee prevailed, winning 6-3, 6-3, 2-6, 7-5.

Lee started his third-round match tonight by going up two sets to love, his brand of unspectacular but steady tennis forcing Murray to come up with something special to win points. More often than not, an agitated Murray ended points with unforced errors (Once, Murray kicked a trash can after winning a point).

But he turned things around in the third set. Murray found the range on his first serve (he finished with 15 aces) while more errors started to creep into Lee’s game.

Lee, however, found his game again in the fourth set. Although he twice requested treatment from a tour trainer for his back, he was able to take a 5-2 lead. Murray answered by fighting off match points and rallying to 5-all. He got a little help from Lee who clearly got tight.

Lee held to 6-5. Murray, needing to hold serve again, picked the worst possible time to play a bad game. Lee took advantage, breaking Murray again to close out the match.

The near loss to Murray in San Jose wasn’t the only reason Lee, a baseliner, had a real shot at upending Murray. Lee was in fine form, having beaten Guillermo Canas in the second round — and all Canas has done this year is beat Roger Federer twice on hard courts. Also potentially working in Lee’s favor was the fact that Murray is returning from a wrist injury.

Lee’s workmanlike game — built more on steadiness than booming serves and rocket winners — was at its best against his opponent, a 20-year-old baseliner known to mix power with a feathery touch.

Now Lee goes to the fourth round, matching his best United States Open result.

Murray, with his coach Brad Gilbert, can go regroup.
