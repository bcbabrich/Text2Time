Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students debate the issues of economic prosperity, cultural preservation and environmental preservation in examining the proposed development of land in the Bahamas.



Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will

1. Identify reasons why an area of land might be desirable to humans; categorize reasons as related to economic prosperity, cultural preservation, and environmental preservation.

2. Examine the debate over the development of Bahamian beaches by reading and discussing “Bahamians Resent the Loss of Beaches to Luxury.”

3. Evaluate, through research and discussion, the issues of the featured article by taking “pro” and “con” approaches in looking at economic prosperity, cultural preservation, and environmental preservation.

4. Analyze, through the writing and presenting of proposals, the possible compromises between Bahamian development supporters and dissenters.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-paper

-pens/pencils

-classroom blackboard

-copies of “Bahamians Resent the Loss of Beaches to Luxury” (one per student)

-resource materials on the environment and culture of the Bahamas and on proposed economic development there (computers with Internet access, geography textbooks, global history textbooks, other related classroom resources)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM UP/DO NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following question (written on the board prior to class): Many struggles over land have occurred throughout time for different reasons. What are some of the reasons why an area of land might be desirable to human beings? While students are writing, create four columns on the board, titling them as follows: Economic Prosperity, Cultural Preservation, Environmental Preservation, and Other. Students share their journal responses and categorize them into the columns on the board. Students may supply specific examples for each of their ideas.

2. As a class, read and discuss “Bahamians Resent the Loss of Beaches to Luxury,” focusing on the following questions:

a. Why don’t Bahamians have access to the beach?

b. Why do developers want to build along the shorelines of the Bahamas?

c. Where does the Bahamian government stand on this issue? Where do the people of the Bahamas stand?

d. How is the battle between supporters and dissenters of land developments linked to history, and to whose history is it linked?

e. Why do preservationists and conservationists say this region is a “rare resource of natural beauty and historical richness”?

f. What does Laurie Wilkie mean when she calls the Clifton Point region a “veritable Rosetta Stone”?

g. Why was Vivian Whylly unsuccessful in filing his claim on the land?

h. How could the developers protect the located at Clifton Point?

3. Divide students into two main groups, half of the class focusing on the “pros” of development in this case and the other group focusing on the “cons” of development. Further divide each group into three smaller groups, and assign each subgroup one of the following topics to research with regards to their assigned position: Bahamian economy, Bahamian culture, Bahamian environment. Using all classroom resources available to them, students research their topics and prepare a statement explaining their findings and supporting their positions. The subgroups then share their statements with the class, and students should take notes on all presentations.

4. WRAP UP/HOMEWORK: Students reflect on the day’s lesson and write out a plan of compromise between the supporters and dissenters of developments in the Bahamas. In a future class, students should present and debate their proposals.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–Is it possible to have art and culture without monetary support?

–In what situations do you think environmental preservation can be used or “sacrificed” for economic gain?

–What role do the world’s beaches play in the global environment?

–What is a gated community? What are the benefits and drawbacks of living in a gated community?

–What is a pirate, and how has the definition changed over the centuries?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated on written journal entries, participation in small group research, participation in class discussions, and written plans of compromise.

Vocabulary:

resent, reef, exclusive, access, undeveloped, marina, intersperse, amenity, contend, preservation, plantation, artifact, conservation, skeptical, iridescent, inland, wetland, archaeologist, dwell, ilk, cove, inlet

Extension Activities:

1. Extend the lesson to two days. On the second day, review students’ proposals and as a class, develop a single plan of compromise that would meet the needs of all sides of the debate.

2. Research the steps to declaring a land mass a national park. Under Bahamian law, would the region to become Clifton Cay be eligible?

3. Identify the various islands that much up the Bahamas. How have developments affected those islands, and what effect have they had on the Bahamian economy?

4. Investigate the structure of the Bahamian government, and research the rise of Prime Minister Ingraham to power.

5. Visit an area of your community that still exudes nature. Research the plans for development in that area and compose your own photo essay of the land.

6. Research the history of the Lucayan Indians. Who were/are they, and what role have they played in the development of Bahamian culture?

7. Create a travel guide of New Providence or another Bahamian island. On different pages, offer history, culture, and other important aspects of Bahamian life.

8. Research the steps followed when an archaeological find is made at a site to be developed.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History – Examine the parallels between the developing of Clifton Cay and the barrier reefs of the United States. How do American developments affect American economy, culture and the environment?

Global History – Investigate the creation and use of plantations around the world, particularly in the Western hemisphere. Research the term “plantation,” including its evolution and current definition and usage.

Science – Write a report or create a classroom poster focusing on the impact of developments on the ecosystem, including the migration patterns of animals in the Bahamas.

-Create a bulletin board collage. Paint a Bahamian reef background. Using the Internet and old magazines, clip pictures of Bahamian reef wildlife. Paste pictures onto the bulletin board along with a caption giving the name of the species.
