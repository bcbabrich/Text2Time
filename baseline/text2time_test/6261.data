PEKING, Sept. 30 (Reuters) —China's National Day celebrations marking the 24th anniversary of the establishment of the Communist government in Peking got under way officially tonight with a reception for 1,500 people in the glittering banquet hall of the capital's Great Hall of the People.

On hand were Premier Chou En‐lai, Wang Hung‐wen, the 38‐year‐old former Shanghai worker who has shot to third place in the leadership, and Chairman Mao Tse‐tung's wife, Chiang Ching.

There were no speeches at the reception, in keeping with the recent policy of a less formal celebration of National Day. The once obligatory national parade, which has been dropped since 1971, was again missing from this year's celebrations.

But the Chinese capital was ablaze with lights as thosuands of people strolled and cycled around the vast Tienanmen Square.
