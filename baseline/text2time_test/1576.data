MILAN – If Chris Mullin ever becomes a Knicks executive, as has long been speculated, he will surely be thrilled with the roster he inherits.

Mullin came to Italy this week to help the N.B.A. promote the Knicks’ exhibition game against Armani Jeans Milano. On Friday, he presided over a 3-point contest on the plaza next to the Duomo and later participated in a community service event.

Donnie Walsh, the Knicks president, has long been fond of Mullin, who once played for Walsh’s Indiana Pacers. There are persistent rumors that Walsh wants to hire Mullin but has been blocked by team ownership.

Mullin skirted the speculation on Friday but he enthusiastically praised the work Walsh has done to revitalize the Knicks.

“I think it’s been pretty dramatic, actually,” Mullin told a handful of New York reporters. “Now you’ve got to wait and see how it is on the court. But they’ve made a lot of changes. Obviously, Amar’e is a huge part of that.”

Walsh stripped the roster over the last two years to clear salary-cap room, with LeBron James as the primary target. When James chose Miami, Walsh landed Amar’e Stoudemire, one of the top big men in the league, then filled out the roster with a number of promising players, including Raymond Felton, Anthony Randolph, Roger Mason, Kelenna Azubuike and Timofey Mozgov.

“I don’t know anyone who could have done a better job than he’s done already,” Mullin said. “The work he did to get under the cap, to be in the position he was last summer, and then to get Amar’e, that’s the way you do it. You always have a plan, and Donnie, wherever he’s been, there’s no mistake, his teams have gradually gotten better.”

Mullin said that Stoudemire’s presence would make a huge difference, particularly for talented young players like Wilson Chandler and Danilo Gallinari.

“When you have a team of good players, almost on a daily basis you’re kind of scouring around to see where the pyramid falls into place,” said Mullin, a former Golden State Warriors general manager. “When you get a key guy like Amar’e, not only does it help situate your team, I think it helps the other guys focus on what they do best. Sometimes when you don’t have that marquee guy, you try to do more than you’re capable of doing.”

Needless to say, Mullin is also optimistic about the future of Randolph. Mullin, after all, drafted him for the Warriors in 2008. Randolph is fantastically athletic but unpolished. He has been slowed by injuries.

“His talent is incredible,” Mullin said. “He’s a hard worker, he’s a good kid. Careers take different paths. He was injured last year. But what I saw of him in practice, his potential is pretty high. Sometimes that’s dangerous, because there is so much talent there. But I think once he gets into a stable situation, he’ll do really well.”

As for his own future, Mullin said he wanted to return to an N.B.A. front office eventually, but was in no rush. He said he had had no recent discussions with Walsh.

“I’ve been doing a lot for the N.B.A. Taking these trips has been great,” he said. “So for me, the right situation comes up, I would definitely look at it. But I’m not really struggling with what I’m doing. I’m pretty happy. So no, no real time frame on that.”
