Wallowing in mood over event, moment over entirety, “North Sea Texas” demands complete surrender to the maturing of Pim (Jelle Florizoone), a sensitive 14-year-old trapped in a tiny Belgian coastal town.

“The boy lives in a world of his own,” opines Pim’s accordion-playing, restlessly disappointed single mother, Yvette (Eva Van Der Gucht). Sealed in that world, Pim surreptitiously spritzes Yvette’s perfume and crushes painfully on his leather-jacketed best friend, Gino (Mathias Vergels). Burning looks in the garden shed lead to experimentation in a pup tent, but when Gino, a floppy-haired charmer, takes his experiments across the aisle, heartbreak is not far behind.

Directed by Bavo Defurne (working from a novel by André Sollie), “North Sea Texas” is calm and rapt — no hysterical adolescent passions here — a simmering drama powered by fully drawn characters and fine performances. And with its indeterminate period setting and tarnished-sunlight glow (courtesy of the gifted cinematographer Anton Mertens), the film has a delicate, dreamlike quality that’s quite affecting. But Pim’s withdrawn demeanor and inability to verbalize his emotions — the character is basically one big ache — make it more challenging than it should be to immerse ourselves in his journey.
