THURSDAY'S assemblage of music by the New Music Consort at Weill Recital Hall seemed touched by a variety of influencing hands, yet all these pieces followed the serious steadfastness of purpose that has marked mainstream 20th-century composition.

Thus postwar jazz, for example, is very much the substance of Charles Wuorinen's Trio for Trombone, Percussion and Piano, while in Ruth Meyer's ''Fragments of Sappho'' her spare harp writing and the flute part's bendings of pitch gave an almost Japanese accompaniment to these song settings for soprano.

Two of Thursday's pieces seemed more self-contained in style, owing -, or at least referring - less to outside influences. One was Pierre Boulez's ''Derive,'' a very beautiful single movement bound together by long strands of tremulous instrumental tone. The three-year-old work is written for flute, clarinet, violin, cello, vibraphone and piano (here conducted by Claire Heldrich), and in describing it, one wants to celebrate both the power of its elegance and the elegance of its power.

The second of the two is even more recent - Elliott Carter's ''Esprit Rude/Esprit Doux'' for flute and clarinet. Here, intricately contrapuntal networks and very high spirits (often emphasized by the upper registers of both instruments) operate symbiotically. In keeping with the title, Mr. Carter's high energy is interrupted in midstream by cooler layers of sustained and overlapping tones.
