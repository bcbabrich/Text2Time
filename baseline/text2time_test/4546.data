The most popular items on the menu are the spicy turkey burrito, the combination platters and the vegetable sushi. The least popular are the veggie dog and the pizzas. The pizzas are made with nonfat cheese, and anyone who has tasted that knows what rubber tastes like. Mr. Fainberg said he was moving to a combination of low-fat and nonfat cheese for his pizzas.

The six-to-eight-ounce muffins are spectacular. Some are nonfat; some have about four grams of fat a muffin. All have 250 to 350 calories but are a meal in themselves.

Health Zone, at 1445 K Street NW (between 15th Street and Vermont Avenue), looks like an indoor garden. It uses plastic utensils but no styrofoam: carryout orders are boxed in cardboard and aluminum foil. All paper products are from recycled material. Best of all, almost everything served -- it is open for breakfast and lunch -- is made from scratch.

Some things could use a little more salt and a little more spice; the tortillas should be heated before they are used to make burritos, and the cafeteria line needs to become more efficient. But the concept works, and the results are as good as any traditional fast-food restaurant in Washington.

Mr. Fainberg has no illusions. Health Zone is not going to put McDonald's out of business.

But, he said, "if a healthier option is there and it tastes good, it will become a part of your lunch rotation, maybe a significant part of it."
