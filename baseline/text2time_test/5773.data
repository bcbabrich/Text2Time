Puccini's 'Manon Lescaut' A Royal Opera production filmed at Covent Garden, featuring Kiri Te Kanawa, Placido Domingo and Thomas Allen; conducted by Giuseppe Sinopoli Thorn EMI Video 130 minutes. $79.95 ''Manon Lescaut'' may not be everybody's cup of operatic tea, but those devoted to it should find this video cassette a special treat.

Here is an ardent 18th-century love story that involves a riches-to-rags progression - and all the scenic variety entailed - before the hapless pair die together on a desert island near New Orleans.

Implausible? Yes, but, oh, so appealing as acted and sung by Miss Te Kanawa and Mr. Domingo, both of whom are slim enough and young enough to be attractive even in close-ups. The seeming ease and naturalness of their singing gives the performance special believability. Other positive factors include Mr. Allen's portrayal of Lescaut, Manon's scheming brother, and Mr. Sinopoli's splendid conducting.

The Gotz Friedrich production was conceived for the Hamburg Opera and borrowed for use at Covent Garden (this version was filmed there in 1983). There are no scenic or directorial surprises in it, but Gunther Schneider-Siemssen's set for Act II - the rich part - is notably lavish in a nouveau-riche way.
