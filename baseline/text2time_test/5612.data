Lewis Schaffel, the executive vice president and chief operating officer of the Nets, resigned yesterday to join an ownership group attempting to bring a National Basketball Association expansion franchise to Miami. The group is headed by Zev Bufman, a theatrical producer, and Billy Cunningham, the former Philadelphia 76er star and coach.

Miami, which will break ground Monday for a 15,000-seat arena, says it has orders for 4,600 season tickets. Expansion will be on the agenda when the league owners meet Oct. 20-22 in Phoenix. Before joining the Nets, Schaffel, a former player agent, held similar posts with the New Orleans Jazz and the Atlanta Hawks. The Nets divided Schaffel's responsibility into two areas, business and marketing and basketball. Until a replacement is found, Coach Dave Wohl and his assistants, Bob MacKinnon and Gary St. Jean, and Al Menendez, the director of player of personnel, will run the basketball program.
