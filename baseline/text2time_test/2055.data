DES MOINES – Senator John McCain surely has longed for the day when his campaign was not dogged by daily questions and criticisms about his support for the Iraq war.

So after speaking to an assembly of Iowa voters this afternoon as he began a two-day campaign visit to the state, he took questions from a handful of the state’s political reporters and Iraq barely came up. The topic of the day? Immigration. And Mr. McCain, who as a Republican from the border state of Arizona has long been a champion of so-called “comprehensive immigration reform” conceded his feelings of frustration.

“The president, and all of us, feel frustrated sometimes by the criticism and the level of the dialogue,” Mr. McCain said. “I respect the views of those who disagree with us. I don’t question anyone’s patriotism or love of this country. I wish we could lift up the level of discourse and dialogue.”

On Tuesday, President Bush delivered an unusually harsh assessment of his fellow Republicans who are opposed to the immigration reform proposal in Congress. He suggested many of the critics were employing the techniques of fear-mongering.

So what did Mr. McCain, who supports the immigration reform, think of the president’s approach?

“I don’t like to critique the president’s remarks,” Mr. McCain said. “I just don’t think that’s very fair. I am very grateful for his involvement and his engagement.”

In the coming days, Mr. McCain said, he thought it would become clear if the bipartisan immigration compromise would pass the Senate. On Monday, he is scheduled to give a major speech on immigration to the Miami Chamber of Commerce in Coral Gables.

He said he intends to spend “a couple days” on Capitol Hill next week to help the bill along, which is noteworthy, because his presence in the Senate has been scarce in recent months as he spends the majority of his time campaigning for president.

“By the middle of next week,” he said, “we’ll have a very good handle as to whether it’s going to succeed or not.”
