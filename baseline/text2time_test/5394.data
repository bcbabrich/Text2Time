Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. won a Nobel Peace Prize and had a national holiday created in his memory. Rosa Parks became legendary as the woman who refused to give up her seat at the front of a Montgomery, Ala., bus. E. D. Nixon, who died last week at 87, remained relatively obscure. Yet his life demonstrated as clearly as Dr. King's and Mrs. Parks's that an individual has the power to make a difference.

Mr. Nixon made his living as a pullman porter. But he made his life's work gaining freedom for himself and fellow blacks. He seems never to have doubted that it was possible or that he had a role to play in it. In the 1920's, he joined with A. Philip Randolph to organize the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the first successful black labor union. In the 1940's, as head of the Voters League of Montgomery, he led 750 black citizens to the county courthouse to demand that they be allowed to vote. In 1954, he ran for - and lost - a county office of the Democratic Party, but was the first black to seek political office in Montgomery since Reconstruction.

In 1955, when Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to yield her seat in the front of the bus, Mr. Nixon, head of the Montgomery Improvement Association, bailed her out of jail and began organizing the city's blacks for a boycott. He enlisted the young minister Martin Luther King Jr. to lead the protest.

''I knew then that something could be done,'' Mr. Nixon said years later. It went without saying that he would have a hand in doing it. His legacy is a changed nation.
