In a November 1995 ruling that upheld the zoning ordinance limiting the height of the landfill to 90 feet, Superior Court Judge Charles D. Gill noted that Waste Management had made approximately $50 million in gross revenue during the two preceding years in which the validity of the ordinance was being appealed.

The appeal now pending in the State State Supreme Court is the second time the case has been before the state's highest court. In July 1995, the court ruled 5-0 in favor of the town's position. That decision reversed two lower court rulings that had gone in favor of Waste Management in 1993. And those proceedings had been in the legal pipeline going back to 1990. But as early as 1985, Waste Management had apparently caught town officials off guard when it petitioned the state for permission to expand the dump to 190 feet from 90 feet.

While Waste Management published a notice of its application for a modified permit in local newspapers, ''no comments were received from New Milford town officials,'' the Supreme Court ruling noted. After the State Department of Environmental Protection granted the permit in February 1987, ''no appeal was taken'' by the town, the court said.

Liba Furhman, the New Milford Mayor from 1991 until last year, said that zoning officials never received notice of the permit application; her predecessor, since deceased, denied any knowledge of the application, which would have gone to his office first. And the newspaper notice was published, she said, on New Year's Eve, drewing no notice in the town.

Mrs. Furhman, a Democrat, also noted that the town was handicapped in its dispute with Waste Management because of its lateness in adopting zoning regulations. New Milford was, she said, one of the last municipalities in the state to adopt relevant zoning regulations.

In 1971 the town adopted zoning statutes that prohibited a landfill in an industrial zone. But the landfill on Route 7 existed prior to the regulations and it thus became a ''permitted nonconforming use,'' the court decisions have noted. The prior owner of the dump had received a permit from the state to operate the landfill to a maximum height of 90 feet, after which the subsequent owner, Waste Management, sought and received permission to increase the height to 190 feet leading to the legal confrontation.

''It is a period in my life that I'd like to forget,'' Mrs. Furhman said of the town's fight with Waste Management.
