SAN ANTONIO — With less than 40 minutes to kickoff of the Big 12 championship game here at the Alamodome between No. 1 Missouri and No. 9 Oklahoma, fans are beginning to slowly trickle to their seats.

By winning tonight, the Tigers (11-1, 7-1 Big 12) will clinch a berth in the Bowl Championship Series title game. Their lone loss this season was a 41-31 setback at Oklahoma (10-2, 6-2) in October, a game in which Missouri led in the fourth quarter and had four turnovers.

Tonight’s game is expected to draw at least 60,000 fans to this 65,000-seat venue, a Big 12 official said. If activity on the famed Riverwalk is an indication of attendance makeup, the Sooners will seemingly have a 3:2 advantage in fans.

Outside the dome, Oklahoma fans were chanting “overrated” to Missouri fans. Missouri students Whitney Bodenstab and Alissa Rasmussen, who drove 13 1/2 hours from Columbia, Mo., to attend tonight’s game, hardly seemed bothered by the taunting.

“We’ll win because we’re better,” said Bodenstab, 20, a sophomore majoring in communications, advertising and marketing. “We’ve developed a lot more since we played them last time.”

Bodenstab and Rasmussen said they had enjoyed their first-ever trip to San Antonio and were impressed by the Riverwalk. They were also pleased with temperatures in the 70s here.

“Usually, it’s like cold,” said Rasmussen, 20, a sophomore, of the weather in Columbia. “Like in the 30s and 40s.”

But neither Bodenstab nor Rasmussen packed shorts for this trip.

“Our legs are too white,” Rasmussen said.
