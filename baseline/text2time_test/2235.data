As word spread about controversial remarks by the state Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, his Republican opponent, J. Christopher Callaghan, stood happily under the media spotlight talking about flub.

Mr. Hevesi created a stir by talking of Senator Charles E. Schumer “putting a bullet between the President’s eyes.’’

Mr. Callaghan wasted no time jumping into the fray. “What could he have been thinking?,” he said of the threats. “I think it’s horrid judgement.” He added, without too much bluster: “How can a statewide official say that?”

When one reporter asked if Mr. Hevesi needed “psychological evaluation,” Mr. Callaghan demurred.

“I’ll let you make up your own quotes,” he said.
