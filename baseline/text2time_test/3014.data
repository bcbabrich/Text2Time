To the Editor:

Re ''Memorial for Wellstone Assumes Spirit of Rally'' (news article, Oct. 30):

I was horrified to see and read the reports of the laughing, clapping, convention-style behavior by the state and national Democratic leaders at the Wellstone memorial.

For those who wished to memorialize this principled man, the moment in history to do so was lost in this circus. For those of us who hardly knew him, his legacy is confused.

How sadly inappropriate for Paul Wellstone, a champion for the little guy. I cannot imagine the pain that the other victims' families experienced as this rally unfolded.
