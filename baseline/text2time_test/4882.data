The house and the pictures hit home -- my home in Cuba, which I left in 1960. In 1988, my daughter had the opportunity to visit Havana. She was allowed to visit my home and take pictures. The cover page of your magazine -- the house after and before -- was exactly what she brought back. What a poignant and accurate photograph. CRISTINA A. PEDROSO FERNANDEZ Montclair, N.J.
