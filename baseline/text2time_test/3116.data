Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students work in groups to study a Tony Award winner from the past through researching its history, watching the production, and reading the written origin of the production. Students then create programs for these productions and assess how and why the live, film and written versions of the production are similar and different.

Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes- 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Consider some of the differences, as an audience member, between watching a play, watching a movie and reading a novel or play.

2. Learn about this year’s Tony awards by reading and discussing the article “‘The Producers’ Can’t Win All the Tonys (Can It?).”

3. Investigate the history of assigned Tony Award-winning plays and musicals that have written “counterparts” or versions.

4. Develop programs for their assigned productions that include a historic look at the musical (stemming from research); a review of the production (after watching the production on video); and an analysis of the differences among live, film and written versions of the same piece (after reading the original text of the production.)

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-paper

-classroom blackboard

-copies of the article “‘The Producers’ Can’t Win All the Tonys (Can It?)” (one per student)

-computers with Internet access (one per pair or small group)

-videos and written versions of a variety of Broadway productions (one of each per small group, as directed in Activity 3 below)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following questions (written on board prior to class): “Think about a movie and a stage production (play or musical) that you have seen. What are some of the key differences between these types of productions? In what ways are they similar? How does the experience of an audience member differ when in a movie theater versus in a playhouse? How would reading the script of these productions affect the way you perceived them?” Students then share their responses.



2. As a class, read the first section of the article “‘The Producers’ Can’t Win All the Tonys (Can It?),” focusing on the following questions:

a. What show is up for the most awards at this year’s Tonys? How many awards is it up for?

b. Why can’t this show take home all of the awards for which it is nominated?

c. Who is hosting the 2001 Tony Awards?

d. How did Broadway do at the box office this year?

e. Who is responsible for Tony award nominations? How are nominees selected and winners chosen?



3. Divide students into pairs or small groups of three, and assign each a different past Tony winner that is on video and that has a written “counterpart” or version (suggested productions: “Cats,” “West Side Story,” “Cyrano de Bergerac,” “A Streetcar Named Desire,” “Death of a Salesman,” “The Crucible,” “Inherit the Wind,” “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,” “The Diary of Anne Frank,” “Look Homeward, Angel,” “Candide,” “A Raisin in the Sun”, “Miracle Worker,” “Camelot,” “Man of La Mancha,” “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?”, “Oliver!,” “The Wiz,” and “Dracula.” Note that students will be reading in groups the text of the play or musical, so assign the works according to student age and ability level.) Each group conducts some brief Internet research to investigate the following aspects of the history of their assigned production. (Students should enter the name of their production into a search engine like Yahoo! or Google to find the official sites of the productions, fan sites, and Tony Awards sites.) Write the following questions on the board for easier student access:

-When did this production play, and where?

-How long was the “run” of this production?

-Who were the main people who wrote, produced and starred in this production?

-What is the plot of this production?

-Who are the main characters?

-Where and when is this production set?

-Is this production a musical or a play?

-Have there been any revivals of this production on Broadway, and if so, when?



4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Students will be creating, over a period of time, a multi-faceted “program” for the productions researched. First, students should use the research to create a “history” section, in which they answer the above questions in essay format. Next, have each group of students rent or borrow the video version of the production researched, and after watching it develop a review of the work. Students should include in their review a reflection on how the movie version of this production and the live production would likely differ. Finally, each group reads the “book” version of the production (whether it is a collection of poems, short story, novel or play) and writes the final piece of the program: an analytical piece about how and why the live, film and written versions of the production differ. Students should then assemble their programs, complete with photographs, appropriate advertisements they develop throughout, and any other interesting pieces they wish to incorporate (trivia quizzes, lyrics, great quotes, etc.) Programs should be presented or displayed.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–Of the major award shows (the Oscars, the Grammys, the Emmys, and the Tonys), which do you think is the most popular? Why do you think this is the case?

–What elements comprise an award-winning production?

–How should a person behave at a live theater performance? How is this different than the way one behaves at a movie? How does audience behavior impact one’s perception of the production?

–Do you think that actors have to act differently on stage than they do on film? Why or why not?

— Do you think that Mel Brooks should be given the award for Best Score because he is a famous entertainment veteran, even though he is not really a composer? Why or why not?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated on completion of journal entries, participation in class discussions, research and creation of posters based on survey questions, completion of group surveys, and presentation of data to the class.

Vocabulary:

unbearable, psychic, glean, handicappers, inevitable, beatification, abundance, groused, elite, perpetual, anonymity

Extension Activities:

1. Browse the official Tony Web site (//www.tonys.org/) and create a poster highlighting the most interesting facts you discover about the Tonys, both past and present, from the site. Include pictures, quotations, and statistics that you find on the site.



2. Stage a performance of scenes and monologues for students who may not have had much exposure to live theater before. Conduct a discussion after the performance about the difference between film and live theater, and encourage the audience to express opinions about their experience.



3. Create a picture book or short video tracing the “birth” of a play to Broadway to its nomination for a Tony. Explain how directors and actors are chosen, what their rehearsal process is like, and what stages the play goes through as its success grows.



4. Research the history of the Tony Awards and create an illustrated timeline of the winners for Best Musical and Best Play, as well as Best Revival, throughout the award’s history. Indicate overlaps when a play nominated for Best Play was then nominated for Best Revival later.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History

-When did Broadway become “Broadway”? Research the history of the most famous theatre district’s beginnings and rise to prominence, and write a short exposition on your findings. Include a map detailing the location of the area known as “Broadway.”

-Watch a video of a Broadway musical production that reflects historic events, such as “Ragtime” and “1776.” How accurately do you feel the events and people are presented in the musical? Try to develop a song for a musical about a current event and perform it for the class.



Economics/Mathematics- Compare the financial expenditures and revenues of a Broadway hit to a blockbuster movie. Create graphs comparing statistics such as actor salaries, set and costume expenses, and ticket sales.



Social Studies- The plot of “The Producers” pokes fun at a topic, the Holocaust, which is a sensitive one for many people. Watch the movie “The Producers,” or another movie that uses humor to deal with this topic, such as “The Great Dictator” or “Life is Beautiful.” Write a critique of whether or not you think that the humor in the film is effective or offensive.



Technology- Create a 3-D model of both a Greek theatre and a modern Broadway theatre. Illustrate the types of technology used in both cases. Present the models to your class and explain how technological advances have changed the way in which live theatre is presented.
