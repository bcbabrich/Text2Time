CHARLESTON, S.C. – The most famous face in the city at the moment is that of the composer Philip Glass. You see him in miniature and writ huge, on a 38-by-26 foot banner at the Gailliard Auditorium. You see him on posters in store windows and restaurants. You see him walking toward you on the street, on the front of a T-shirt, and as likely as not, the wearer is carrying a program book for the Spoleto Festival U.S.A., with – who else? – Philip Glass on the cover.

And he is not even here yet. Beginning on Wednesday, Mr. Glass will present the American premiere of his “Book of Longing,” which has its world premiere tonight in Toronto. A theater piece, it is based on music and images by Leonard Cohen.

But the image in question here is the acclaimed “Large Phil Fingerprint/Random” (1979), by Chuck Close. Festival logos in recent years have tended to be more abstract, but this one is concrete and insistent. And not everyone is happy about it, to judge from comments at a private party last night, or even knows who it is.

The Charleston Post and Courier reports that it did a quick survey on the street last week, and none of the 21 passersby queried knew who it was. One woman thought it looked like Rocky Balboa. And you know, there is a little resemblance. It would explain, at least, the swollen-looking lips.
