Antibacteria mania and germ-phobia — twin phenomena in a society increasingly obsessed by cleanliness — have been in full view amid all the public hoopla over MRSA, the drug-resistant staph infection that has caused a public health scare lately.

To prevent the spread of MRSA, public health authorities are urging people to wash their hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer; to cover all wounds with clean bandages; and to avoid sharing towels and razors. Those who share sporting equipment should clean it first with antiseptic solution.

But a state assemblyman from Brooklyn would like to take things a step further. The assemblyman, Dov Hikind, announced today that a hand-sanitizer manufacturer would distribute 10,000 hand-sanitizing “pens” for use by city schoolchildren.



“These GelRite pens are self-contained dispensers with alcohol-based hand sanitizer,” said Mr. Hikind, a Democrat. “They’re compact and easy to use and will encourage students to clean their hands frequently. A few ounces of pen prevention are worth pounds of cure.”

The pens were made by DermaRite, based in Paterson, N.J. The GelRite pens contain an antimicrobial waterless sanitizing gel that leaves “no sticky or tacky residue,” the company states on its Web site.

Hand sanitizers like Purell have become increasingly popular, especially among people with extensive contact with the public — like politicians.

The movement to create superhygienic environments has its skeptics. As Jane E. Brody has written in The Times, “People frightened by a microbial world that harbors superbugs they believe are out to get them may be adopting an approach that actually fosters rather than suppresses serious infections.” Too much antimicrobial activity may be leading to the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant germs and weaker immune systems in children.

Mr. Hikind said he did not want to alarm parents. Since the authorities announced that a 12-year-old boy at a Brooklyn middle school who died this month was infected with MRSA, the authorities have been trying to reassure parents. Mr. Hikind says it is fine to be reassured, but even better to be prepared.

“We don’t want to scare parents, but we have to make parents and students aware: This bacteria is opportunistic — an open cut or sore and it can enter the bloodstream,” he said. “Tell your children again and again: Wash, Cleanse, Cover. We can try to control the spread of MRSA, but it’s going to take a new way of thinking and a new way of behaving, and carrying a hand sanitizer pen with you is a great step forward.”
