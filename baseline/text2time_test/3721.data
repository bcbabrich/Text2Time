Among some lawmakers, especially those who advocate a hard line against immigrants, there is a sense that the laws of 1996 were so sweeping that very little more can be done or added to the debate. The budget for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, much of it dedicated to enforcement, now surpasses that of the F.B.I., and the agency has more employees than either the Department of State or Labor.

''The Clinton Administration took some major steps showing that it was serious in trying to control illegal immigration,'' said T. Alexander Aleinikoff, a law professor at Georgetown University and former general counsel and associate commissioner of the immigration service. ''Some people are saying, 'We've dealt with the problem. We've done what we can. Let's move on.' ''

But the issue of illegal immigration is far from resolved, Mr. Aleinikoff said. There are about five million such immigrants in the United States and no law that specifically addresses what to do with them.

Instead, lawmakers are sidestepping immigration in their campaigns, and have been passing legislation that benefits immigrants and, in some cases, reverses aspects of previous laws.

Congress has restored most of the welfare benefits it took away from legal immigrants in 1996. Lawmakers also restored some of the protections that Central American immigrants had lost, therefore sparing them from deportation. Congress granted amnesty to 150,000 Nicaraguans, 5,000 Cubans and 49,700 Haitians and allowed hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who hope to gain permanent visas to stay in the United States instead of having to go home to file their applications, as the 1996 law dictated.

Congress granted $171 million to the immigration agency to speed the naturalization process and, for the first time in years, it increased by 5,000 the number of refugees allowed into the country every year.

''The pendulum is definitely swinging our way,'' said Judith E. Golub, director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Association in Washington.
