George Young, the Giants' general manager, said that Simms in all likelihood would have surgery but he declined to say when. When players need surgery, the Giants tend to take care of it quickly, so the procedure could take place by the end of this month.

"This is not a career-threatening thing," Young said. "Let's not be an alarmist about this. He has some problems and all indications are this will be nip-and-tuck type of surgery."

Still, some people in the organization are slightly worried. They say arthroscopic surgery is delicate by nature and in a sense is even more delicate when performed on the throwing arm of a quarterback approaching 40.

The advantage for Simms is that he is one of the best-conditioned quarterbacks in pro football history. A major reason he has been able to play 15 years is that he takes good care of himself, engaging in extensive weight training and conditioning programs.

"I'm not worried about it," said Young. "It's not a major concern."

But if it should be a serious problem, the Giants' quarterback situation would become very interesting. The Giants would have to determine whether Dave Brown or Kent Graham is ready to step into the starting role. If Simms could not perform, would the Giants, who already have a number of players who are free agents, have to look for a free-agent quarterback?
