Back in 1636, a group of Lenape Indians sold a 3,600-acre parcel of land in what is now the Flatlands section of Brooklyn to a pair of Dutch settlers.

The deed from the sale, which is one of the earliest examples of private land ownership in New Netherland was sold at auction on Wednesday at Bloomsbury Auctions in Manhattan.

Auction house officials called it the first deed for land on geographic Long Island, which now consists of Nassau and Suffolk Counties and the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens.

“This is the very first deed for land on Long Island, and one of the very first for land in New York,” said Jeremy Markowitz, head of Americana sales at Bloomsbury. “It is one of the oldest documents about New York in private hands.”

The document, which brought $156,000, was sold by a private collector, and bought by a private collector, whose identities the auction house would not disclose.

The deed, dated June 6, 1636, is written in written in Dutch and outlines the purchase by Wolfert Gerritsz van Couwenhoven and Andries Hudde of “the westernmost of the flats called Keskateuw belonging to them on the island called Suan Hacky between the bay of the North river and the East River of New Netherland,” according to an auction house description.

The deed is signed by the Dutch colonial governor, Wouter von Twiller, at “Eylandt Manhatans” and reaffirmed on the back in 1658 by Gov. Peter Stuyvesant.

The parcel was part of an area called Keskateuw, which may have derived from the Lenape word for “where grass is cut.”

Mr. Markowitz described the deed as “one of the oldest Dutch documents in private hands” and one of the earliest examples of private land ownership in the colony controlled by the Dutch West India Company.

Of course, we wouldn’t be surprised to learn that this transaction was as questionable as the debunked story that the Dutch bought Manhattan for trinkets. Calling all historians …
