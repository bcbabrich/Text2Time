I would like to offer a few observa tions concerning “Kashmir Houseboats: The Unhurried Life,” by Rene Lecler (Travel Section, Oct. 8).

To THE EDITOR:

First of all, the Kashmiris are phys ically beautiful people, but I feel they are out to milk the tourist of every penny. This is exemplified by the price of $10 a day which the author thought he was fortunate in obtaining. My hus band and I were on a houseboat in the best part of Dal Lake for 20 rupees a week (about $1.50), which included three meals a day, bedroom living room, porch and bathroom. Second, why take a hired car to Pahalgam when the local bus is by far the more educational and picturesque? And by far the cheaper.

I feel that The Times, by reporting the most expensive way to go, could discourage many tourists from going to Srinagar. And anyone who is adven turous enough to go all the way to Kash mir would probably be enlightened enough to appreciate traveling “with the people.”

I realize that no article can cover everything, so I would like to call atten tion to some favorites of mine: the breathtaking pony rides up mountain paths into the Himalayas; the fantastic Ice Lingam pilgrimage which many Hindu tourists make; the two‐hour climb up to the mountain‐top temple of Shan karacharya with its Shiva temple and breathtaking view; the many beautiful examples of lacy‐wooden architecture which grace Srinagar, and the fantastic government emporium of Kashmiri crafts located in Srinagar, an estate of beauty with spacious gardens and good buys.
