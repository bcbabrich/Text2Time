Wei Wei, visiting New York from the Michael Schultz Gallery in Beijing, showed up on Tuesday morning at the blocklong Barnes & Noble on the Avenue of the Americas, between 21st and 22nd Streets, in the old Ladies’ Mile shopping district.



He was looking for monographs of Sam Francis, Keith Haring, James Rosenquist and Frank Stella, whose work the gallery plans to exhibit. His hotel had recommended this particular Barnes & Noble for the strength of its art section.

But Mr. Wei was late. About 18 hours late. The 35,000-square-foot store, among the larger units in the chain, closed on Monday evening after 14 years in business.

“I had heard some bad things about the U.S. economy,” Mr. Wei said, wondering whether this was somehow connected to the foreclosure crisis.

No, it had to do with — well, you can imagine what it had to do with.

“In anticipation of the lease coming up, we tried negotiating with the landlord,” said Mitchell S. Klipper, chief operating officer of Barnes & Noble. “The brokers came in and put crazy numbers in their minds. We can’t pay those kinds of rents. We’ve been looking two, three years for a replacement. We have not been able to find a suitable location at rents that are affordable.”

Mr. Klipper said that “nobody likes closing stores — trust me,” and added that most of the employees in Chelsea had been transferred to the Union Square or TriBeCa branches. (The Astor Place store also recently closed.)

Mr. Klipper recalled signing the lease 15 years ago when that stretch of Sixth Avenue was just beginning to wake up from a long slumber. “We were very concerned whether anybody would shop there,” he said. “When we came, it put a foothold in the area. The next big box came and the next big box came.”

And that’s what the landlord is looking for, according to the sign in the window: “Big Box Retail.” Ideas have already surfaced on the Racked blog.

Where plate glass windows beckoned browsers as recently as last weekend, there now hang rolls of kraft paper, intended to block the view of passers-by. But this shield is not seamless, and one can glimpse slices of the interior. The décor is standard B&N issue, though it is ennobled here by colossal columns from the days in the early 20th century when this was the Adams Dry Goods emporium.

Familiar as the store looks, it now seems poignantly remote, a relic from another age.

Is it possible? Have things taken such a turn in Manhattan that we are growing nostalgic for Barnes & Noble; the big bully that was once so easy to blame for the demise of the neighborhood bookshop?

A middle-aged woman who passed by the locked doors on Tuesday after Mr. Wei departed — a neighbor, to judge from the blue laundry cart she had in tow — delivered her own brief eulogy. “It’s the saddest thing, isn’t it?” she asked.
