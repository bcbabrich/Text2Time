Following are excerpts from yesterday's ruling by Judge Denny Chin of Federal District Court allowing Khallid Abdul Muhammad to hold a youth rally in Harlem that he calls the Million Youth March (M.Y.M.):

The city's desire to deny Muhammad and M.Y.M. a platform from which to speak is understandable. Many of their statements are bigoted, hateful, violent and frightening. The right to free speech, however, applies not only to politically correct statements but also to statements with which we may disagree and, indeed, abhor.

At least as frightening as the rhetoric of Mr. Muhammad is the possibility of a society where freedom of speech is not respected, and where the right to speak publicly can be denied on the basis of administrative whim, personal dislike, or disapproval of anticipated content. . . .

On Last Year's Rally

I cannot conclude that the violence occurred as a direct result of the inflammatory words uttered by Muhammad (and others) to the crowd. To the contrary, one of the videotapes shows that, at the time the conflict broke out, Muhammad was telling the demonstrators to ''go home to [their] families,'' to ''go in the word of love,'' to ''go in the word of peace,'' and that the crowd has already begun to disperse. . . .

I am left with the disquieting impression that the rally was ending and that if the police had simply been patient and given the participants a few minutes to disperse, the risk of violence would have been substantially reduced. The scenes of demonstrators throwing barricades and other objects are disturbing, but also disturbing is the spectacle of dozens of police officers in riot gear moving in on the stage, with a helicopter swooping overhead, just moments after the rally was scheduled to end, when the rally was indeed about to conclude. . . .
