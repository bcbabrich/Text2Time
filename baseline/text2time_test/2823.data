To the Editor:

The big increase in the uninsured (front page, Sept. 30) is only part of the problem with our health care system.

The nominally insured whose policies exclude pre-existing conditions also face substantial medical and financial risk.

These problems are inherent in a perverse health care system in which a profit-driven health insurance industry sustains itself by denying the very services the system is intended to provide.
