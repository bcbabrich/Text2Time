Once again, we have the incongruous spectacle of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton winning big in a contest while the nomination slips further and further from her reach.

It looks like her margin in Puerto Rico could be more than 2-1 over Senator Barack Obama.

But back on the big board, the one that counts, Mr. Obama is inching closer to the magic number of 2,118 delegates needed to claim the nomination.

Mrs. Clinton also struck a somewhat incongruous tone in her victory speech from San Juan — both elegiac (“The campaign has been an extraordinary journey”) and defiant (“Let’s keep fighting”).

There is no doubt that she will carry on through the last primaries Tuesday in South Dakota and Montana.

Still, this speech was interesting for its balancing act — steering clear of criticism of Mr. Obama while trying to convey to superdelegates that they should choose her in their final analysis.



Did you catch how she framed her argument that she would be a stronger candidate than Mr. Obama?

Instead of stating it flat out, as she has many times in the past, she put that thought in the second person. “You voted for the person you believe would be the stronger nominee and the best president,” she said.

She also spoke directly to the superdelegates. “I do not envy the decision you must make,” she said. And then again, she framed her argument at a remove from herself, posing a series of questions that superdelegates will have to consider: “Which candidate best represents the will of the people who voted in this historic primary?” and “Which candidate is best able to lead us to victory in November?”

She reiterated her view that she is winning the popular vote and suggested that superdelegates should give it the same weight they give to the delegate count, which she acknowledged in her speech Mr. Obama was winning. So superdelegates have to decide which is more important.

The Clinton campaign has pointed out for weeks, if not months, that Mr. Obama won’t have enough delegates to claim the nomination without the superdelegates. It’s partly a way to show the race isn’t over, despite what the pledged delegate count may say, and a way of suggesting that even Mr. Obama, who presents himself as removed from the old politics, has to rely on these party insiders.

But now there’s a theory floating around that he might be working on a way to avoid the appearance of having to rely on superdelegates.

Instead of waiting around for these insiders to hand him the nomination after the voting Tuesday, some superdelegates might come out for him before the voting. That would let actual voters, in South Dakota and Montana, push him over the top.

But we digress. We were talking about Mrs. Clinton’s win in Puerto Rico.
