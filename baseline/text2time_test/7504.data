Prices of soybeans for future delivery broke sharply yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade and tumbled almost 4 cents a bushel.

The wobbly wheat and other grain markets fell in sympathy, but in much less active trading.

At the close on the Midwest exchange, soybean futures prices fell 2⅞ to 3¾ cents a bushel. Each cent represents $50 a contract. Wheat declined 1/4 to 1/2 cent; corn, 3/8 to 1 cent; oats, 7/8 to a cent, and rye was unchanged to down 3/8 cent.

The large volume of hedge selling and outright liquidation of positions was directly attributed to forecasts of favorable weather for gathering the soybean crop and moving it to market.

One brokerage house, Reynolds & Co., described the soybean situation this way: “In the violence of the price rise of the past few weeks, many have forgotten the cause — that rarest of events — a genuine weather market.”
