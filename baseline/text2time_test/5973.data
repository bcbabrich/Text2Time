After spending several years in Los Angeles, Mr. Badrena settled in New York City in 1980. ''Los Angeles is a sleepy town,'' he said recently. 'It takes the incentive out of you. It's more inspiring here; this is the only place interesting musicwise.'' Mr. Badrena makes a living here by playing on records. He has recorded with Chic, the Brecker Brothers and many other performers in the past year. He also plays on advertising jingles.

Young musicians often wonder how a player manages to break into studio work. The best way is to know somebody. ''I had already made a name with Weather Report,'' Mr. Badrena noted, ''but I also have a friend here, Sammy Figueroa, who is almost a brother to me. He helped me get the jingles and a lot of other gigs.'' Mr. Figueroa, a percussionist, records and occasionally tours with a wide assortment of jazz and pop performers. At present he is working with Miles Davis. Getting a Concept Together

A musician who insists on playing his own way, no matter what, will not last doing studio work. ''I actually prefer it when the people I'm working for have their concept together and know what they want from me,'' Mr. Badrena said. ''If they tell me what space they want me to fill, I can create from there and feel freer. Otherwise, I'm dashing around, playing this and that, and they're saying, 'Yes, that sounds good, no, I don't like that, try something else.' That makes me feel more restricted.''

Working in the recording studios leaves Mr. Badrena free to work on his own music. He recorded a solo album, ''Manolo,'' for A&M records in 1979, and although it received some airplay and excellent reviews, it disappeared without a trace. He attempted to put together a group of his own to promote the album, but without record company support it never got off the ground. With that experience under his belt, Mr. Badrena is not in any hurry. ''I want to study this business some more before I try to get another recording contract for myself,'' he said. ''The music I'm writing now is completely different from what I did on my album, and I'm taking my time, letting it develop.''

Mr. Badrena gets recording assignments by listing his telephone number with various musicians' services and by leaving it at busy recording studios. When he plays sessions, he meets other musicians who are doing the same thing, and he often finds that they are also working on music of their own. ''A lot of them are very creative,'' he maintained. ''That's why they do sessions. People put it down and say it stifles a musician's creativity, but from sessions you can get money and then you have a lot of free time to write or practice. It was hard to do that in Los Angeles. There you can work on movie soundtracks and make good money, but they start early and the hours are long. In New York, you can play other people's music and have time for your own music too.''
