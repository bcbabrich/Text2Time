These counties tend to vote for Democratic candidates, but Mr. Franks said he would not cede the Hispanic votes to Mr. Corzine.

At the corner of 42nd Street and Bergenline Avenue here, a bustling business district with stores owned by people from Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and other Latin countries. The contest between the two men was evident in opposing street rallies that formed when Corzine supporters heard that Mr. Franks would be here today.

On the west side of Bergenline, people held up signs saying ''Corzine Si! Franks No!'' On the other side of the street, people held up signs supporting Mr. Franks as well as Gov. George W. Bush. One man wore a green foam hat with a button that said, ''Yo Quiero Bush,'' and a sign that read ''When voting, remember Elian!''

Mr. Corzine, in his pursuit of Hispanic votes, also went to a restaurant in Newark tonight, attending a Halloween party for about 400 children and adults sponsored by Newark Councilman Luis Quintana. And on Monday night, after campaigning for about 13 hours in southern New Jersey, Mr. Corzine flew by helicopter to a dinner of the Passaic County Hispanic Democratic Organization in Paterson. He arrived about 9:15 p.m. and asked about 300 guests to support him and appeal to their friends and neighbors to do likewise.

At each of eight stops as he rode his Straight Talk Express campaign bus, Mr. Franks hammered away at the issue of how much money Mr. Corzine was spending on the race, and why that did not make up for a lack of political experience.

Mr. Corzine, former co-chairman of the Wall Street house Goldman Sachs, has never served in public office. He contends that a political newcomer cannot compete with career politicians without spending significant amounts of money to get his name and positions known.

But Mr. Franks has tried to turn Mr. Corzine's spending into the main issue in the race.

''I think it's raised serious questions about what role our democracy is going through right now, about whether or not these seats might only be available to the super wealthy, to the elite in our society,'' Mr. Franks said here at the Union City Cafeteria on Bergenline Avenue. ''The playing field is vastly tilted because only one candidate has this extraordinary wealth that he's bringing to bear on this election.''
