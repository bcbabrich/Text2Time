Peace Day Urged

The Pontiff recalled that he had urged world leaders three years ago to join in the church celebration of Jan. 1 as an an nual peace day. Pope Paul did not mention the Vatican's ad herence to the international treaty. A Vatican comment is sued with the official statement described the treaty as a “con dition for general disarma ment.”

The Vatican disclosed that it had consulted various govern ments on the matter, and that it would set a date for the signing ceremony in agreement with the three Governments that are sponsors of the treaty. They are the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union. This was taken to mean that formal diplomatic exchanges would take place also between the Papacy and the Soviet Gov ernment. Although the Vatican and the Kremlin have no offi cial ties, informal contacts have occurred lately. Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko paid a call on Pope Paul in November.

The treaty of 1968 on halting the spread of nuclear Weapons was ratified by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1969, and came into force on March 5, 1970. The Vatican, as a sovereign state, has become a signatory of several interna tional treaties and agreements in the past.

At noon today, the Pontiff praised the commutation of the death sentences recently im posed by courts in Burgas and Leningrad as contributions to world peace.

Praises Decisions

Addressing a crowd in St. Peter's Square from a window of the Vatican's Apostolic Palace, the Pontiff said: “We are starting the new year, by the grace of God, with the comforting thought of the two acts of clemency that have con cluded two senational trials.”
