The prolonged search for the Jets' next head coach went through its final step yesterday.

Dick Steinberg, the general manager, met with Mike Holmgren, the offensive coordinator of the Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers.

Holmgren originally was on Steinberg's so-called ''ready list'' of potential coaches, then was scratched when Steinberg was unwilling to wait until after the Super Bowl to interview him. But when the Jets' deal with George Perles of Michigan State fell through, Steinberg decided to try Holmgren.

''Unless something happens, we'll make the coaching decision next week,'' Steinberg said yesterday. Holmgren is supposed to be the last person interviewed for the job, for which Bruce Coslet of the Bengals and Ted Plumb of the Eagles, both offensive coordinators, are highly regarded candidates.
