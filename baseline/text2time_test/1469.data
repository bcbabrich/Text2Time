There’s no other series on television now quite like the TNT cop drama “Southland,” for better and for worse. No show advertises its desire to be taken seriously — its bid for instant-classic status — as insistently as this visually austere account of the daily lives of Los Angeles patrol officers and detectives.

That intention is telegraphed right away in the sepia-toned opening-credits montage, with its images of the Los Angeles River and of Richard Ramirez, the Night Stalker. “Southland” wants to be seen alongside Chandler and Ellroy, “Chinatown” and “L.A. Confidential,” as part of the Southern California-noir pantheon.

That didn’t matter to NBC, which abruptly canceled the show in October before its second season had even begun. The series drew good reviews but middling-to-poor ratings, dropping as low as 4.6 million total viewers, during a seven-episode trial run last spring. It had the potential to radiate prestige — to be the type of production that network suits like to be associated with — but it wasn’t drawing viewers in. And NBC had devoted its 10 p.m. time slot, the show’s natural home, to Jay Leno.

Into the breach stepped the cable channel TNT, which doesn’t need to attract as many viewers as the broadcast networks do. It reran the seven first-season episodes (the premiere in January drew two million people) and beginning Tuesday will show six new episodes that were completed before NBC pulled the plug. No announcement has been made about the show’s future beyond those six; once again, “Southland” finds itself auditioning.

The show has always played a classic double game: it takes the “realistic,” nonsensational, 9-to-5 approach to police work while bringing in as much action, violence and sex around the edges as possible. Episodes begin with chaotic spectacles — the aftermath of a shooting, a car rolling and exploding during a high-speed chase — and then become long flashbacks. If you sit through the quotidian detail of the cops’ days, you’ll get to see the car blow up again.
