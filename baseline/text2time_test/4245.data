Cards and letters and calls are making their way to the powers that be. The Rockland County Commission on Human Rights, the Rockland County Historical Society, the Historical Society of Bergen County and various scholars have weighed in to support the tribe's petition for recognition. Finally, Chief Van Dunk says, he is getting an inkling from the tribe's lawyers that someone in the Department of the Interior might be taking the Ramapoughs seriously. "The Government realizes we're not going away," he said.

The Ramapoughs say they have been here, tucked in the craggy landscape straddling the New York-New Jersey border, since well before the border existed. The tribe traces its ancestry back 5,000 years, to the Lenape tribe. But it has had a time proving it. Two years ago, the Bureau of Indian Affairs denied the tribe's petition on the ground that their lineage could not be traced effectively.

BUT another issue is at least partly to blame: casino gambling. Political opposition to the Ramapoughs' petition grew after Federal law allowed gaming operations on tribal lands. Mr. Torricelli, a Democrat from Englewood, initially supported the tribe's petition and even wrote letters on its behalf. But he changed his mind, he said, when he realized the Ramapoughs were "only interested in opening a casino." This despite the fact that the Ramapoughs applied for Federal recognition nine years before the Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act became law.

Even if the tribe decides to open a casino -- Mr. Van Dunk says it does not plan to, although he would not rule it out -- should that determine whether the Government recognizes its ancestry?

New Jersey politicians know that the Atlantic City casino operators have been worried about recognition of the Ramapoughs for some time. In 1993, when the tribe's petition was pending, six members of the New Jersey Congressional delegation sent a joint letter to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbit, calling the tribe's claims "dubious" and warning of the negative impact a casino in Bergen County (30 minutes from Manhattan) would have on Atlantic City.
