How can a linebacker be so fast that he can keep up with slot receivers 30 yards downfield?

Almost as if the speed were extraterrestrial.

Hmmm.

If you click on the YouTube link and listen carefully, they do mention Roswell.

Urlacher, it turns out, is from Lovington, N.M., not Roswell. And as a nail salon worker described it an article in The Albuquerque Tribune, he was anything but extraordinary while growing up.

“We used to call him Sissy,” she said without looking up from the nails at hand. “He’s the age of my younger sister Schylar, who’s a nurse now in Amarillo. Brian used to come over to our house in 1992 and 1993. He was a little, scrawny pipsqueak then. He was so quiet we called him Sissy.”
