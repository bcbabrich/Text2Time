To the Editor:

Orrin G. Hatch (Op-Ed, March 29) is out of touch with reality. If President Clinton lied under oath about an alleged sexual affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, the American people will greet this news with a big yawn. People don't care about it.

The world is laughing at us. The soap opera continues with the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, interrogating Ms. Lewinsky's mother and friends to find out who, if anyone, lied or got someone to lie -- all about whether Mr. Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky had sex. This is grounds for impeachment?
