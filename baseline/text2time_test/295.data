Early in Lydia Peelle’s first novel, “The Midnight Cool,” she surveys the teeming crowd of men and animals at a horse and mule auction, and writes: “Skinny dogs trotted through it all like they had someplace to be, crescents of hoof trimmings from the blacksmith held like cigarettes between their teeth.”

The people in Ms. Peelle’s fiction are fully imagined, but we’ll get to them. It’s animals that give her work its heartbeat. The first story in her 2009 debut, “Reasons for and Advantages of Breathing” — as assured and rewarding a collection as you’ll find — was titled “Mule Killers,” referring to the tractors that put these beasts of burden out of the agriculture business. The narrator’s father, a farmer, especially loves a now-unnecessary mule named Orphan Lad, with his “sharp shoulders and soft ears, the mealy tuck of his lower lip.”

The majority of the action in Ms. Peelle’s novel takes place in 1916 and 1917, in the months leading up to America’s entry into World War I, and mules are center stage. The book is even dedicated to them. Billy, a middle-age horse trader, and his young partner and charge, Charles, turn their attention to the British Army’s — and eventually the American Army’s — demand for strong mules overseas. They’re not above cutting corners, but they operate in a patriotic atmosphere in which people remind one another: “Don’t just do your bit, but do your all.”

Billy is injured by a bad-tempered, dangerous horse sold to the pair under false pretenses by Leland Hatcher, the richest man in a Tennessee town. Charles falls profoundly in love with Leland’s spirited daughter, Catherine. The book revolves around three dramas, all of which unfold at a leisurely pace: Charles’s potential consummation with Catherine; the men’s ability to navigate their mule business to an honest profit; and flashbacks to the late 1800s for Billy’s back story, including the explanation of his close relationship with Charles.
