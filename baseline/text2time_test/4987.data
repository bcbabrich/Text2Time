The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Yankee nine that day: They were anchored in last place, with less than half the season to play. As their errors, losses, throwaways grew far too numerous to name, A menacing silence fell upon the veteran patrons of the game.

A few, amid deep despair, turned to the New York Mets. The rest Clung to the hope that springs eternal in the human breast; They thought, if only George would go, after 17 1/2 long years, They'd bet even money that there'd be no need for further tears.

Eighteen times managers came and went; 13 times general managers, too; Lemon, Berra, Dent, Green, Piniella - so what else is new? Ruth-less feuds with Reggie, with Dave, so endless and so mean, Couldn't help but demoralize the formerly Mantled team.

''Fraud!'' the upper deck cried out; the box seats echoed, ''Fraud!'' But the usual scornful look from George - and all the fans were awed. They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain, And they sensed that Billy Martin was destined to be fired - again.
