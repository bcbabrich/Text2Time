HOUSTON – I remember being in a journalism class at Fresno State University in central California as everyone sat in silence, stumped. The professor had asked us the simplest of questions.

What’s the first thing you do after you get a story assignment?

Students jumped in with answers. Pick up the phone. Run out to the story. Grab a notebook. Start writing. The professor, a wiry, fiery, chain-smoking newsman straight from central casting named George Flynn, dismissed all responses.

No one guessed the correct answer – go to the morgue.



The morgue is what newsrooms, decades ago, used to call the dusty collection of file cabinets where old stories are kept, arranged by subject. How long had that bookstore that burned down in a fire this morning been open? Long before Google, you went to the morgue to pull the file on the bookstore to find out, and to turn up scraps of information and clues that would lead you closer to the heart of the story.

I thought of the morgue, and of Professor Flynn, on Wednesday.

I was intrigued by the practice of “rough rides,” the brutal tradition of police misconduct in which handcuffed suspects in the back of police wagons are given a bumpy and wall-slamming ride. Other news outlets had done articles on the phenomenon in light of Freddie Gray, the Baltimore man who, prosecutors said Friday, suffered a fatal spinal injury while being transported in a police van.

What to do first?

Go to the morgue. In today’s world, that means, essentially, to go to Nexis.

Nexis is the database that allows users to search millions of legal documents and newspaper stories, for the most obscure and specific items. It’s the global morgue, on your laptop. In a couple of hours on Wednesday, I searched for rough-riding-related search terms and started reading. I looked for references to suspects who had accused the police of giving them a rough ride, in dozens of newspapers around the country, from the 1980s to the present. I was trying to find cases in other cities, beyond those that other news media outlets had reported.

The point of the morgue and of Nexis is not to use other newspapers’ material. The collection of old news stories you gather and read points you to the names of experts, to lawsuits, to cities. That retired Philadelphia police officer who was quoted in The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2001 saying rookies learn about rough-riding as part of their street training? With a little digging, I tracked down his home phone number and left him a message.

I read a reference in a news story to an old lawsuit in Chicago by the American Civil Liberties Union. I called the A.C.L.U. press office, and the A.C.L.U. of Illinois started looking into it. They eventually sent me a link to download documents from the lawsuit, filed in 1981 in federal court in Chicago. As I read these documents, which described an alleged rough ride given to a handcuffed man named Freddie Franklin that caused him to bite off his lower lip, the subject of rough rides turned from a half-baked idea into a full-fledged story.

I had already been talking to several civil rights lawyers and police-procedures experts around the country in covering the recent fatal police shooting of Walter Scott in North Charleston, S.C. I called some of those same sources to ask if they had ever heard of rough-riding. How did I find, and why would I trust, those sources?

I noticed that a few of the members of the task force that President Obama created to examine police practices in minority communities had served on Harvard University’s Executive Session on Policing and Public Safety. I got the membership list and started contacting former session participants.

By Thursday morning, I had pitched the story to my editors. Now I had a few more hours to do more digging before a version of the article would be posted on the home page on Thursday afternoon.

Time is the enemy of the journalist. I remember reading the line in an old journalism textbook. And it’s true. You must get what you can when you can. The retired Philadelphia officer never called back. The A.C.L.U. had lost touch with Mr. Franklin, who filed the federal suit in Chicago. I found a lawsuit filed against the City of Aurora, Ill., in 1999, but the case was so old that no actual documents were available online in the federal court system database, so I could use but limited detail from that case.

In the end, some of the best material in the article came from that original search of decades-old newspaper stories. In other words, it came from the morgue.
