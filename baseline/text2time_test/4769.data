North Dakota has become the 48th state to give its workers a paid day off in memory of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Gov. George Sinner, a Democrat, signed the legislation on Thursday and said the holiday would remind North Dakotans of the philosophy of civil rights and nonviolence that Dr. King espoused. Arizona and New Hampshire are now the only states without a paid holiday in honor of Dr. King.
