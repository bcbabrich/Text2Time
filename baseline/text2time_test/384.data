The Atlantic

Many of us who grew up savoring the subversive humor and psychological sophistication of the early “Peanuts” comics have had to confront the question: When did it go bad? When did it lose its edge and become a maudlin “Happiness is a warm puppy” Hallmark sentiment? In this deep and thoughtful piece, Sarah Boxer examines the theory that the emergence of Snoopy — the narcissistic upright-walking beagle — as the strip’s central character is to blame. The story offers a glimpse inside Charles Schulz’s complicated relationship with his characters and with his own success. — Carolyn Ryan

New York Magazine

Sometimes you read an article and think, sarcastically, “Wow, tough assignment.” You might have that reaction to this terrifically entertaining Maureen O’Connor piece about partying with millionaires in Gstaad. (The occasion is the annual gathering of A Small World, an international members-only club.) Or you might just be glad you stayed home, after reading retch-inducing details like this one: “Jimmy Choo has manufactured golden sleds, which everyone rides down the mountain.” — Dan Saltzstein

Vox

What accounts for Donald Trump’s political popularity? The answer, Vox suggests, is in the writings of the anthropologist and philosopher Dr. Ernest Becker, who wrote that supporting charismatic figures is an existential strategy to ward off terror. Terror of what? Read on. — Jack Begg

Priceonomics

“What needs to be invented?” a musician-engineer named Andy Hildebrand asked his lunch companions in 1995. “Why don’t you make a box that will let me sing in tune?”one responded. That was a holy grail for inventors, and Mr. Hildebrand was the perfect person to take up the quest. Here is the back story behind Auto-Tune and the simple economics of why — love it or hate it — music studios had no choice but to adopt it. “Sometimes, I’ll tell people, ‘I just built a car, I didn’t drive it down the wrong side of the freeway,’ ” the story quotes him as saying. “But haters will hate.” — Dan Blumberg

Politico

We all get what we want from “Star Wars” — technological thrills, nostalgia, participation in the national conversation — but the author finds our modern political discourse too. In this essay he writes, “In Star Wars, I see now, art and analysis merge in a galaxy-sized reminder that politics — that indefinite combination of power and money, family drama and national fate, our better angels and our inner demons — is the most irresistible of human activities to ponder.” — Jennifer Steinhauer
