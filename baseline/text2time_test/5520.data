A Moslem radio station, the Voice of Lebanon, said as many as 50 gunmen took part in the ambush.

While the shooting was going on, a motorcade of the guards of President Amin Gemayel was driving in the vicinity and it too came under fire, the Government-controlled Beirut radio said. Mr. Gemayel was not in the presidential limousine at the time, however. Rumors soon spread that there had been an attempt on the life of the President, but they were denied. Seven presidential guards were wounded in the incident.

Mr. Shaftari headed the Christian team in three months of Syrian-sponsored negotiations in Damascus with representatives of Moslem militias. Last Saturday, Mr. Hobeika, Nabih Berri, the leader of the Shiite Amal militia, and Walid Jumblat, the Druse leader who heads the Progressive Socialist Party, signed an armistice agreement.

Mr. Gemayel is due to go to the Syrian capital on Thursday for talks with President Hafez al-Assad. According to news reports here, they will discuss steps for putting the peace agreement into effect. The pact provides that 20,000 Syrian troops already in Lebanon will remain there and play a role in preserving law and order. Split in Christian Ranks

The attempt to kill Mr. Shaftari, the 29-year-old head of security and intelligence in the Christian militia, was seen here as a reflection of a growing split in Christian ranks.

The peace accord has evoked strong opposition from prominent Christian leaders, including such figures as Camille Chamoun, a former president.
