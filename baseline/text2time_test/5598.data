Every morning at 8 all summer long, the distinctive bellow of a steam whistle raises thunderous echoes and sends the gulls scattering across Elliott Bay as the tourist ship Princess Marguerite backs out of her pier and swings up Puget Sound to Victoria, British Columbia, to deliver yet another load of money.

This tiny cog in Seattle's business machine has major economic significance for Victoria, situated on an island and cut off from the larger economies of both Vancouver, British Columbia, and Seattle.

As of July 1 a new, faster catamaran called Victoria Clipper joins the Princess Marguerite on the route. Norwegian built, Dutch registry, Seattle owned, the catamaran makes the crossing in two and a half hours, as against four hours and 15 minutes for the Marguerite.

The ''Victoria Cat,'' as its owners nicknamed it, will make two round trips a day through September, and one a day all winter. With capacity of 300, its fare is $59 for a round trip, and $35 one-way. The Princess Marguerite, which can transport up to 1,800 people, has round trip fares of $29, and $18 one-way. Impact on Economy
