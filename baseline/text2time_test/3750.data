In the Devils' last game, goalie Martin Brodeur had come in for his rookie backup, Mike Dunham, after one period with the Devils trailing Anaheim -- and New Jersey had come back to win.

Tonight, the tables were turned. After a dreadful first period against Buffalo by the usually stalwart Brodeur, Dunham started the second period with New Jersey trailing by two goals. Unfortunately for the Devils, the result was not the same, as the Sabres held off a late flurry and skated to a 6-5 victory in front of 18,595 at Marine Midland Arena.

''I felt we weren't playing that great, and I wanted to give Dunham some ice time too,'' Devils Coach Jacques Lemaire said. ''Goaltenders are going to have good games and not so good games. That's the way it is.''

The Sabres jumped out to a 3-1 lead in the opening period on just six shots against Brodeur.

Brian Holzinger's 12th goal of the season at 4 minutes 8 seconds of the period kicked off the scoring.
