In 1985, Michael J. Fox was one of the biggest stars in the world: “Back to the Future” and “Teen Wolf” occupied the top two spots at the box office, and “Family Ties,” the long-running sitcom on which he played Alex P. Keaton, was at its peak. “I wanted to be a rock star,” Fox told David Marchese in this week’s Talk interview. “That’s what I thought being famous was. But I wasn’t a rock star. I was kind of an idiot. I missed the point.” Six years later, Fox found out he had Parkinson’s disease, which he credits with getting him on track. Fox still acts occasionally — later roles include those on “Scrubs” and “Boston Legal” — but has dedicated his life to advocating a cure for Parkinson’s. Fox and Marchese talked about acting with Parkinson’s, taking the wrong roles and staying positive: “Until it’s not funny anymore, it is funny.”

He still believes in a cure for Parkinson’s.

His foundation, which has raised $800 million to combat the disease, has a working relationship with the government. (Still, Fox found himself upset when President Trump appeared to mock Serge Kovaleski, a reporter for The New York Times who has the joint condition arthrogryposis. But he didn’t feel the need to say anything in response: “People already know Trump is an [expletive].”) He’s still hopeful for a cure. In the interim, he’s optimistic about a new drug that acts like a rescue inhaler when people freeze, but knows that prophylactics are not a cure — but they’re better than nothing.

He worried about presenting a “false hope” about his diagnosis.

“I’d made peace with the disease but presumed others had that same relationship when they didn’t,” he told Marchese. But then his experience got worse: He found himself in a position where he couldn’t walk and had round-the-clock aides, and was unsure if he could still keep up his hopeful disposition. He’s working on a new book about wading through all this.

His response to the diagnosis was to make a number of comedic films: “For Love or Money,” “Life With Mikey” and “Greedy,” which were critical and commercial flops.
