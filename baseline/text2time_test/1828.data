My Sunday column is from Abyei, on the oil-rich divide between north and south Sudan. I’d welcome your comments.

A number of readers have asked what they can do. For specific ideas about steps you can take, I’d recommend Enough Project, Save Darfur Coalition and the Genocide Intervention Network. If you have other suggestions, please post.

[An update: Reuters is reporting that fighting broke out on Saturday in a village west of Abyei. They’re reporting that 70 people were killed.]
