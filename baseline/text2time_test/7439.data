ACCRA, Ghana, April 30 —The Government of President Kwame Nkrumah has abandoned its barrage of anti‐American propaganda, which led to a serious strain in relations with Washington.

For more than three weeks there has been a notable absence of the attacks in the Government‐controlled radio and press.

Editorial assaults and Government‐sponsored demonstrations reached a peak in January and early February with the expulsion on charges of subversion of four Americans, who were visiting professors at the University of Ghana.

The State Department strongly protested and recalled Ambassador William P. Mahoney Jr. to Washington for “urgent consultations.”
