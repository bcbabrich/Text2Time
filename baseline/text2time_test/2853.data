SO even if more jobs and more paychecks fail to materialize, the typical household will keep up its spending, Ms. Warren contends. People will do so by going into debt, or deeper into debt, to acquire what they view as essentials. Such consumption will help sustain the economy in the coming presidential election year, although painfully for many households. ''It is hard to construct a happy story for 2004 unless we consistently create a significant number of jobs, which we have not done yet,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, a research and consulting firm.

The happy story will materialize once the strengthening economy is consistently generating 300,000 jobs a month, said Jared Bernstein, senior labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute. So far, job creation, while finally rising, has not reached half that level. If the level is reached soon and maintained over the next year, that would be enough to absorb the nearly 3 million people who want to work and begin to push wages up. Real disposable personal income -- that is after-tax income -- has risen by 3.2 percent over the past year, but that resulted almost entirely from the mortgage refinancings and tax cuts, the Commerce Department reported. The wage portion has been stagnant for nearly three years.

''Nonlabor sources have been the sole driver of real disposable income,'' Mr. Bernstein said.

The growing list of purchases that households consider essential helps explain why ''personal consumption expenditures,'' as the Commerce Department calls them, held up so well over the last 33 months, which included an eight-month recession followed by persistently weak economic growth.

There have been 10 recessions since World War II, and this was the first in which consumer spending provided support instead of dragging the economy down. With jobs disappearing and wage income going nowhere since 2001, that support should theoretically have given way this time, too. But households regarded an increasing portion of their outlays as essential.

What is more, they had nonwage means to pay for them. Rising home prices and falling interest rates allowed homeowners to withdraw tens of billions of dollars in equity from their homes through mortgage refinancing. Tax cuts have also fueled consumer spending. The two together put more than $200 billion into people's pockets this year. The falling interest rates also encouraged households to run up other debt: car loans, for example, and on credit cards.

Still, while consumer debt, including mortgages, is at a record level -- approaching $8 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve -- the monthly repayment at nearly 14 percent of disposable income is manageable, according to Edward McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs. The Federal Reserve's ''financial obligations ratio,'' which includes debt service as well as rent, auto leases, property taxes and homeowner insurance, comes in at 18 percent of disposable income. Both measures are at near-record levels, but not so high as to inhibit spending, thanks mainly to low interest rates.

''What consumers consistently tell us is that mortgage rates and car loan rates have never been lower, and that is an opportunity they don't think they should miss,'' said Richard T. Curtin, director of consumer surveys at the University of Michigan. ''They don't expect these rates to be lower in their lifetimes.''
