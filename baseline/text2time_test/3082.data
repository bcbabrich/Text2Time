The scientists have formed a partnership with the Parsis of Bombay -- one of India's tiniest but most successful religious minorities -- to save the vultures and, with them, the Parsis' traditional method of disposing of their dead.

The Bombay Parsi council plans to build an aviary on Malabar Hill where disease-free vultures will be bred in captivity. The central government has given its permission to proceed, but the council is waiting for a go-ahead from the Maharashtra state government.

Still, even in the best circumstances, it will be at least four years before there are enough full-grown vultures, said Dinshaw Mehta, a trustee of the council. He said that these days the decomposing bodies are sometimes left exposed for as long as three weeks before the tropical sun dries them out. Sometimes, a foul odor drifts on the wind.

And so Parsis are faced with a wrenching quandary that has stirred an emotional, polarizing debate within the community: what should they do with the dead in the meantime?

Some, like Phiroze Bativala, whose wife, Dhun, died last year, have chosen cremation over the traditional method. He said he could not bear the thought of leaving her to the mercy of the elements for so long. ''It is most irrational and cruel to expose her to this thoughtless way of death,'' said Dr. Bativala, a retired dental surgeon. ''I should not expect her to be eaten by rats and little crows.''

But for many Parsis in Bombay, the death of the vultures is not just a threat to an ancient custom, but a challenge to their distinctiveness as a people.

On a stroll through the peaceful confines of Doongerwadi, where bird song is more piercing than the distant roar of the city, Khojeste Mistree, an Oxford-educated Zoroastrian scholar, reacted to the horror outsiders often feel about the Parsi way of death and explained why he is among its impassioned champions.
