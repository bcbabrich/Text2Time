Francisco da Costa Gomes, a high-ranking Portuguese military officer whose opposition to his country's fight against liberation movements in its African colonies eventually led to his appointment as president, died yesterday at the military hospital in Lisbon. He was 87.

General Costa Gomes came to power after the Carnation Revolution of 1974, named because of the flowers placed in the rifle barrels of the soldiers who led the bloodless coup that toppled the 41-year right-wing dictatorship.

General Costa Gomes, then chief of the defense staff, succeeded Gen. António de Spínola as president in September 1974, five months after General Spínola had led the coup that overthrew Premier Marcelo Caetano's authoritarian government and then unexpectedly resigned.

Under General Costa Gomes, Portugal ended its colonial involvement in Africa that began in 1415, granting independence to Angola, Mozambique, the Cape Verde Islands and São Tomé and Príncipe. Guinea-Bissau, then Portuguese Guinea, had gained independence under General Spínola.
