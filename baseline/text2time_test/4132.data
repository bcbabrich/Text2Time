Seeking to improve their defense with speed and experience in the secondary, the Kansas City Chiefs signed one-half of what was the Jets' secondary for the last five years, cornerback JAMES HASTY and safety BRIAN WASHINGTON, as unrestricted free agents yesterday. The 29-year-old Hasty received a four-year deal, and Washington, also 29, a five-year contract. No other terms were disclosed.

Hasty has started all 111 games he played since joining the Jets in 1988. He has missed just one game in his career and has started 103 in a row. Washington, who played for the Cleveland Browns as a rookie in 1988, has missed just two games in his career. Combined, they have accounted for 45 interceptions in their six years.

The Chiefs' only other signing of an unrestricted free agent this off season was offensive tackle JEFF CRISWELL, also from the Jets.

The Jets, meanwhile, got their first defensive lineman in the free-agent market, but not the pass-rushing end they long for. MATT BROCK, who is expected to be the tackle on passing situations, played six seasons with the Packers.
