The Charles Schwab Corporation said yesterday that its founder and chairman, Charles R. Schwab, would give up the title of co-chief executive in May, though Mr. Schwab intends to continue piloting the company's strategy.

David Pottruck, who has been managing the company's operations for five years, will become sole chief executive and president. The company said Mr. Schwab's move would bring the company in line with new standards of corporate governance, though almost no other big American financial company has split its chairman and chief executive roles lately.

One exception is the E*Trade Group, one of Schwab's rivals in online trading. Last week, E*Trade, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., named an outside director to be its chairman after Christos M. Cotsakos resigned as chairman and chief executive.

Neither Mr. Schwab, who turned 65 in July, nor Mr. Pottruck, 54, was available for comment yesterday, said Greg Gable, a spokesman at Schwab's headquarters in San Francisco.
