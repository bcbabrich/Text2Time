Although the district was supposed to close its doors yesterday, state officials said they would keep it running through the end of the school year. Under the package, the district would receive $10 million that was not used by the Oakland Unified School District. The balance would come from the statewide student drivers' education fund, which was discontinued, said Fred J. Stewart, the state-appointed trustee managing the financial affairs of the bankrupt school system.

The loan carries stiff requirements. Annual payments will begin with the 1992-93 school year and will continue through the year beginning in 2002. In addition, Mr. Stewart said he and the district must reach an agreement over a teacher pay package by June 30 or he would have the prerogative of imposing a new pay scale. The Governor has long maintained that any state bailout must include concessions from the district's teachers.

The plan, details of which were finalized last night by Governor Wilson, Mr. Honig, Mr. Stewart and Gray Davis, the State Controller, will be presented to the Contra Costa County Superior Court, which ordered the state on Monday to bail out the Richmond system. The plan also requires approval from the Federal bankruptcy court.

The Governor has contended that the state should not bear responsibility for a district that mishandled its finances. The parents in the district, who filed the suit that lead to the current turmoil, say the state should assume responsibility for the education of their children regardless of the way the district was run. Shore Up a District

It is believed to be the first time a state has been ordered to shore up a deteriorating district, said Kent McGuire, an education professor at the University of Colorado at Denver and a school finance expert. Other states, like New Jersey and Ohio, have voluntarily injected money into systems or even taken over those whose operations have been ruled inadequate.
