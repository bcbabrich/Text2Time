Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders have tentatively agreed to extend New York State's sales tax into a broad new area - the service industry.

The sales tax is also expected to be applied to magazines, which now enjoy special exemption, and to telephone calls made to 900 numbers.

But under the agreement, the details of which were still being worked out today, the bulk of the new revenue would come from extending the sales tax for the first time to services like custom computer programming, management consulting, public relations and cleaning services. $500 Million in New Taxes The new sales taxes, it is estimated, would be worth almost $500 million a year. The budget is expected to total $50 billion, and legislators are looking for ways to fill a budget gap that is estimated to be as high as $4 billion.

Business lobbyists, who have bitterly opposed the plan to expand the sales tax, say it represents a major departure from the state's longstanding policy of limiting the tax to tangible goods and to services that result in tangible goods, like film developing. They say they are concerned that the new sales taxes could crimp New York's service industry, which has been the fastest growing segment of the state's economy.
