Overview of Lesson Plan: Students investigate examples of hate crimes and their causes by participating in a round-table discussion. Students will also write a personal essay describing their personal views on the subject and describing a plan for putting their views into action.



Author(s):

Alison Zimbalist, The New York Times Learning Network

Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Express their impressions of the causes of hate crimes.

2. Examine examples of hate crimes, society’s perception of hate crimes, and the possibility that these types of crimes are on the rise by reading and discussing the Op-Ed article, “Staring at Hatred.”

3. Write a personal essay expressing their personal views about hate crimes and intolerance and describing a plan for putting their views into action.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/ pencils

-classroom blackboard

-copies of “Staring at Hatred” (one per student)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/ DO-NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following questions (written on the board prior to class): “What is a hate crime, and why do you think hate crimes occur?” Students then share their responses, and the teacher makes a list on the board of the “reasons” for hate crimes offered by students.

2. Read and discuss “Staring at Hatred,” focusing on the following questions:

a. What crime did John William King commit?

b. What other examples of hate crimes does the author describe? Who were the victims of these crimes, and who committed them? What “reasons” were given for committing these crimes?

c. What is the conclusion reached by the Southern Poverty Law Center about incidents of hate crimes?

d. According to Morris Dees, chief trial counsel of the Southern Povery Law Center, what is fueling the hatred that leads to hate crimes?

e. Are the victims of hate crimes and those who commit them restricted to a particular group of people? Give examples to support your answer.

f. Do you agree with the statement, “The desire to turn away from a crime as grotesque as the murder of James Byrd in Jasper, Tex., is understandable”? What reason does the author give for this attitude?

g. Why do you think “some sense of warped superiority, or inadequacy, or fear” might lead someone to commit a hate crime?

h. Based on the final paragraph of the article, what is the author’s opinion about what needs to be done in order to stop hate crimes?

3. In round-table discussion format, consider these questions:

–What are the causes of hate crimes?

–What can we, as a society and as individuals, do to reduce hate crimes?

To keep the discussion flowing in an orderly manner and to decrease any personal attacks that may occur over such a heated issue, the teacher may want to keep a “stack” of the names of students who wish to contribute to the discussion. Students who wish to speak can have their names added to the list by raising their hands, and names are added to the bottom of the list to maintain the order in which students volunteer to speak. Establish ground rules that prohibit personal attacks, raised voices, and disrespectful language in order to encourage a free-flowing, candid discussion.

4. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: Students write a personal essay expressing their personal views about hate crimes. The essay should include an action plan that describes how individuals and social institutions (including schools, churches, and local, state, and national governments) can acknowledge and address the causes of hate crimes.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–What is a hate crime? How is a hate crime different from other crimes?

–What is the relationship between hate crimes and attitudes of prejudice and intolerance?

–Where do individuals learn attitudes of prejudice, intolerance, and hatred?

–What are the definitions of racism, anti-Semitism, and homophobia?

–Are there examples of hate crimes that have been committed in our community? If so, who was/were the victim(s) and who committed the crime(s). In each case, why would you describe this as a hate crime? How did the community respond to each crime?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on written journal response, participation in class discussions, and written personal essay and action plan.

Vocabulary:

supremacist, aberration, inhumane, repelled, sanction, presupposes, prejudice, intolerance, litany, taunted, abducted, biracial, gleeful, frequency, viciousness, proliferation, racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, grotesque, wallowing, hideousness, impulses, mayhem, warped, superiority, inadequacy, maiming, despised

Extension Activities:

1. Research laws that deal with hate crimes on the local, state, and federal levels. For each law, investigate specific examples of how that law has been enacted in the United States.

2. Organize a debate on this topic: Hate groups should not enjoy the right of free speech as guaranteed by the First Amendment as individuals and groups that promote less controversial beliefs.

3. Find news articles about the murder of James Byrd Jr. and the trial and conviction of John William King and compare them to this op-ed article. How do these different types of newspaper writing present ideas differently?

4. Learn about the history and work of the Southern Poverty Law Center and present your findings to the class. (Address: Southern Poverty Law Center, 400 Washington Avenue, Montgomery, AL 36104; online at (//www.splcenter.org/)

5. Read a novel or other book on the subject of racial, religious, or other type of prejudice or hatred and discuss it with the class. (Suggestions: To Kill a Mockingbird, Black Boy, The Summer of My German Soldier, The Diary of Anne Frank.)

6. Write a children’s book that contains a lesson about tolerance.

7. Write slogans and create posters to encourage tolerance and understanding and discourage prejudice and hatred.

8. Note: This activity is suitable for older students and will require careful monitoring by the teacher. Review the literature and/or Web sites of hate groups and analyze their messages and tactics. Write a letter to one of these groups expressing your opinion about their beliefs.
