CHICAGO — Phil Hughes and Ivan Nova are friends, two young pitchers who have worked their way through the Yankees’ minor league system to become important pieces of the major league team. With six starters now on the Yankees’ roster, however, they know that there is not room for both of them.

On Tuesday night against the White Sox, Hughes will make what is likely to be his final audition for a place in the rotation. On Thursday, Nova will do the same. After that, Manager Joe Girardi said, the Yankees will probably have to make a choice.

“Competition is a good thing,” Girardi said. “If they both throw the ball the way we want them to, then decisions will have to be difficult on what we do.”

Hughes and Nova, both right-handers, present different cases for inclusion. Hughes has struggled this season (he has also battled a shoulder injury), but he has a longer track record with the Yankees; Girardi has often pointed out that Hughes won 18 games last year.

Nova, on the other hand, has clearly been the better pitcher recently. He pitched well early in the season but was sent to the minors when Hughes returned from the disabled list last month. After being recalled Saturday to pitch during a doubleheader against the Orioles, Nova picked up where he left off, allowing two runs and six hits over seven innings to push his 2011 record to 9-4 with a 4.01 E.R.A. Hughes is 1-3 with an 8.24 E.R.A.

Asked Monday if he had any extra concerns going into Tuesday’s game, Hughes said he felt no difference.

“I have pressure on myself,” Hughes said. “I don’t really think about the other stuff when I’m out there. There’s pressure to pitch well every five days, whatever the circumstances are, whether there are six guys in the rotation right now or not.”

Girardi refused to rule out any options after this week’s starts (including using a six-man rotation again, though he acknowledged it was unlikely). The Yankees could send whichever pitcher loses out on a rotation spot to the bullpen or, alternatively, keep that pitcher in a starting role at Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.

Hughes has more experience as a reliever than Nova, and Girardi conceded he was uncertain how Nova would adapt to that role. In 2009, Hughes finished the season as a setup man and was a critical asset as the Yankees won the World Series.

Still, Hughes made it clear he would be unhappy with a return to the bullpen.

“I’d be disappointed, for sure,” Hughes said. “At this time, it’s not really something I’m thinking about.”

After Nova’s start on Thursday, the Yankees will start Bartolo Colon, C. C. Sabathia and Freddy Garcia in this weekend’s series against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park.

JETER SITS OUT After being hit on the right middle finger twice in two days over the weekend (once in the field and once at the plate), Derek Jeter was out of the lineup Monday night in the series opener with the White Sox.

Jeter said his finger felt better than he expected after being hit by a pitch from Orioles starter Jake Arrieta on Sunday. He said he could have played Monday and expects to play Tuesday, but understood Joe Girardi’s decision to rest him.

“Because you use your hands to do everything: hit, throw,” Jeter said. “An extra day will help.”

With the White Sox slugger Paul Konerko also sitting out Monday (he has a calf injury after being hit by a pitch Sunday, too), Chicago Manager Ozzie Guillen joked that fans would be upset that both team captains were on their respective benches.

“Are people going to show up to the ballgame?” Guillen said. “The two captains are not playing. People are going to give back the tickets.”

RODRIGUEZ GETTING CLOSER Three weeks after having surgery on his right knee, Alex Rodriguez is scheduled to begin baseball activities Thursday at the Yankees’ minor league complex in Tampa, Fla., Joe Girardi said.

Girardi did not have an exact timetable on when Rodriguez might be ready to rejoin the major league club, but said, “I’m not thinking it’s going to take three to four weeks once he gets started.”

The Yankees initially said the expected recovery time for Rodriguez, who had surgery to repair a torn meniscus, would be approximately four to six weeks from the July 11 procedure. Girardi said he exchanged text messages with Rodriguez often and was encouraged that Rodriguez had been consistently been upbeat about his recovery.

“He hasn’t said anything about pain,” Girardi said, “and I’m sure if he’s had some, he would have mentioned it.”
