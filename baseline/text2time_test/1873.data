The New York Times reports: “An investor group led by NBC Universal and two private equity firms appeared to be leading the bidding for the Weather Channel, as final offers were due Friday night, people briefed on the matter said.

NBC, the Blackstone Group and Bain Capital were offering about $3.5 billion including debt, these people said. About $1.8 billion of that was in cash, which would be split equally among the three investors. Other bidders for the channel include Time Warner, these people said. A winner may be announced as soon as next week.”
