Other than a pair of two-out walks, Jon Niese had a solid outing in his spring debut. Aside from the walks, he allowed just two hits while striking out two in a 5-3 loss to the Nationals. Niese needed only 22 pitches to get through three innings.

Last year Niese showed that he was capable of winning at the major league level, but the Mets felt he grew tired at the end of the season. This year he needs to conserve energy in the second half of the season.



“He’s now gone through one full season and he’s got to realize what it takes now, he knows what it takes now, to be able to get through the season,” Manager Terry Collins said. “I think at the end he got tired, got a little fatigued, and it gets to a point where you might want to back off some stuff.”

¶Oliver Perez, who had trouble throwing strikes in his first outing Sunday, will pitch again Thursday. Perez threw in the bullpen Tuesday, and the pitching coach Dan Warthen said he was no different than the last time. Warthen seemed to be referring to Perez’s last bullpen session, not the game, because he said Perez threw strikes.
