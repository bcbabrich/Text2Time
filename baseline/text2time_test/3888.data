Call it buzz light.

While any pennant race boosts the energy level bouncing off the fans streaming to the Bronx, the feeling enveloping Yankee Stadium last night fell short of the ecstasy at the same crossroads in last year's season.

''Last year they had the vibe, a whole different tempo,'' said Vincent Middleton, dismayed that 90 minutes before game time he had sold just eight programs from his souvenir stand. ''Last year was just more exciting. Stuff was flying off this stand. I was selling programs faster than they could sell pretzels. I must have sold 6 boxes of 60 each.''

Fans said the dimmed ardor could be attributed to a number of factors. First, their headlong rush to the 1996 playoffs gave them the feeling of arriving in the promised land after what seemed like decades of wandering in the lack-of-champions desert. They are getting used to winning now.

''It was the first time in a long, long time,'' said Larry Hueston, 56, a season-ticket holder from Stamford, Conn. ''What was it, 1980-something or 1970-something, when they won before? Last year, no one had expected them to win, and this year, being the defending champions, you expect them to get to the playoffs.''
