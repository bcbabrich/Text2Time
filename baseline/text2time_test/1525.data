Were it not for the election of the country’s first African-American president two years ago, we might all be a little bit more worked up about the regressive race comedies on basic cable television. We might be writing letters and protesting and demanding a remake of “The Jeffersons.”

In recent years TBS has aimed to become the diversity channel, but by diversity it seems to mean brightly lighted, laugh-track-intensive African-American family sitcoms in which matrons living in fake-looking, tidy ranch houses suddenly become addicted to crack, and old men dress as if for a psychedelic outpost of OTB. The latest arrival is “Are We There Yet?” — produced by the rapper-turned-actor Ice Cube, based on a movie in which he starred — and it loads up the offenses early.

Who is the African-American family man today? In the universe of “Are We There Yet?” he did not go to Harvard Law School or start his own very successful chain of dry cleaners. Instead he is a former dealer of sports paraphernalia, a gender-relations throwback spending most of his time in a garage man-cave.

His wife, Suzanne (Essence Atkins), is a party planner with an officious way about her, though when she is out of her career wear, she has such a woman-child look and voice, you wonder whether this marriage wouldn’t constitute a felony in at least some states. Suzanne wants to hyphenate her name. Nick doesn’t get it. This forms the basis of more or less an entire plotline. While smart comedies have certainly been built on less, there is something so contrived about Nick’s obstinacy that you feel as if you were watching a lesson in feminism that would be more sophisticated if it were rendered as children’s puppet theater.

Ickier still is Nick’s belief that his wife ought to look as if she were waiting for the editors of Sports Illustrated’s swimsuit issue to show up when she gets into bed at night. He cannot deal with the lack of makeup, the flannel pajamas and the hair-do-protective scarf she wears around her head. During the day she looks like Halle Berry, he tells her; at bedtime she turns into Tyler Perry.
