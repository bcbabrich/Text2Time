Ham radio in the Internet age? It’s alive and well, says Walt Baranger of the News Technology department at the Times. On this week’s Bits: Tech Talk show, Mr. Baranger chats with Bettina Edelstein and J.D. Biersdorfer about what’s going on in the world of amateur radio.

Warmer weather seems to bring out the videocams, for better or worse. Ms. Biersdorfer speaks with Steve Stockman, author of “How to Shoot Video That Doesn’t Suck,” about making better and more interesting home videos.

Vaulting isn’t only an equestrian sport — it’s also a way of backing up network data. Pedro Rafael Rosado explains this tech term, after facing a personal storm cloud in the form of a home network failure.

The news roundup includes cellphones listed as possibly carcinogenic, data breaches at Lockheed Martin and PBS, a forthcoming netbook/tablet hybrid with Intel processor called the Ultrabook, talk of a Facebook cloud music service and Apple getting set to announce its next Mac OS X and iOS updates. Ms. Biersdorfer’s tech tip: how to cut through desktop clutter on Windows 7 and Mac OS X.
