Mrs. Dennis can be considered to be speaking for all 1,300 Leagues and their 160,000 members scattered throughout the country as she explains, “Also our scope has broadened. When we were first organized, there was need for special legislation affecting women, just as there was need for special educa tion for the new women voters. But now, instead of focusing on just Mrs. John Q. Public, we interest ourselves in Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Public.”

The League is still strictly nonpartisan though, and it is not unusual for two members who have been working closely together on the same committee for months to remain unaware of each other's political affiliation.

What draws most women into the League in the first place is likely to be a desire to know more about how govern ment works and a wish to join like minded women in considering local, state and national issues.

But some of the most devoted mem bers seem to have gone into the or ganization on almost a social basis (and then they got hooked and found they wanted to take an active part).

Mrs. Bernard West is an example of someone who first thought of joining the League because she wanted “to meet interesting and worthwhile people.” When she and her husband, a lawyer who is in real estate management, moved from Long Island about. 10 years ago to the East Side of Manhattan, Joyce West, who has degrees from Smith and Hofstra, went into the East Manhattan Branch.

“I found it was like a miniature col lege course,” she says. Like other mem bers who want to take an active part, she learned that she was expected to do a lot of homework, even if it was just to ask an intelligent question.

“It can be an all‐consuming thing,” Joyce West, who has two daughters, 9 and 11, says of the League. Now on the board of the New York City League as director of public relations, she gives several days a week to the organization.
