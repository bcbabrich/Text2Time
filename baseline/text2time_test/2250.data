POST-GAME BAWL

Not brawl, this time.

The Portuguese celebrate on the pitch. Terry is in tears on his knees. Ferdinand is also crying. A big hug from Scolari for Ronaldo. Portugal’s players wave to their fans and now Beckham’s trying to comfort Ferdinand, who seems to disagree with him that getting up off the turf would be a good idea.

Terry is comforted by his Chelsea teammate Paulo Ferreira, who holds his face and gives him a hug. Presumably there wil be no hugs for Ronaldo from his Man U teammate Wayne Rooney. That’s it from me. I’m off to catch the celebrations in the Ironbound district of Newark, where the New York area’s Portuguese community closed the main street after beating the Dutch. If they meet Brazil in the semis, they may well end up closing down the whole city after that one. Join us at 3pm EST for Brazil-France. We’ll also be back on Tuesday and Wednesday for the semis. Thanks for reading.

***************

Round 5 Here’s Ronaldo. If he scores, they win. Can he possibly miss? Nope. Portugal win!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 3-1 on penalties. Scolari defeats Eriksson for the hat-trick and ABC show us drunk and sad English fans back home in Wimbledon. Not far from where Tim Henman just crashed out of that tournament.

Round 4

Carragher, must’ve been brought on for this. He turns quickly and puts it right in, but the ref calls it back. He took it before the ref blew his whistle. Tried to sneak that one in. Now he steps back up and tries to go the other way, but Ricardo is there and it’s saved! Genius move by Eriksson putting him in for that trickery.

Postiga is next. He puts it in. Robinson oddly chose not to dive at all. Slots it in to the left. 2-1!

Round 3

Here’s Gerrard. It’s saved by Ricardo!! Still 1-1.

Petit is up and… he misses! Skims it off the post on the left!

Round 2

Hargreaves… makes more friends! Just off Ricardo’s hand and in. 1-1.

Viana up to the spot for Portugal. He misses off the post! He had Robinson diving the wrong way but forgot to put it on target! Still 1-0.

Round 1

Lampard. Can he miss again? YES HE CAN! Someone investigate that man for match-fixing!

Simão steps up to take the first one for Portugal. Ricardo pats Robinson on the back and he waits to step in. This is taking a very long time. Poor Simão. He starts, then stops and puts it past Robinson. 1-0.

Penalty Shoot-out

No Rooney, no Beckham for England. But of course no Deco, no Figo for Portugal, so this might be even. Why don’t they just flip a coin and spare us all a lot of anxiety?

30+1 Miguel’s long cross leads to a corner. Nothing there. 30 seconds left. Maniche wastes the last chance after two crosses go from the right and then the left over the heads of four Portuguese attackers. And that’s it. Now on to the worst possible way to decide as winner in major sports: the penalty shoot-out.

30 Now we’re into injury time of the added time. Portugal have nearly squandered their man advantage.

29 SUB: Carraagher is on for Lennon. Why is unclear.

27 After a nice long break, we’re back and Ronaldo tries to find his way through into hte box, but everyone who’s ever palyed for England appears to be packed into the box.

25 Terry’s down and Ferdinand is helping him stretch. Now he’s having a drink.

24 Petit’s long blast after a thousand short passes bounces right to Robinson. They can’t find a way through the English defense and have been settling for wild shots and long crosses.

23 Miguel’s long cross from the right nearly finds Postiga at the far post. But doesn’t.

22 Ronaldo heads weakly right to Robinson. Amazing that Portugal can make nothing of their advantage. They could really use Deco now.

21 Carvalho gets a Yellow Card for hacking down Neville. Lennon takes the ball down the right again, but dribbles it across the line and out.

19 England’s attack has been all but reduced to Neville throwing the ball in towards Crouch’s head in the box.

17 Postiga!!!!! He scores with his head but he was a foot off-side and it’s waved off!

16 Lennon taken down in the box by Nuno Valente, who got the ball. No penalty. That comes in quarter of an hour.

15 Whew! Another break from all that entertainment as we’ve reached the half-way mark of added time. Time for England’s fans to sing their 97th rendition of God Save The Queen. Hopefully Luis Figo is doing his best to implore God to save us all from another penalty shoot-out.

15 Ronaldo narrowly misses with a long shot from above the box. Just over, though it looked like Robinson had it covered.

13 What’s more boring than watching England’s 11 play in this World Cup? Watching England’s 10.

12 Crouch get sthe ball in the box and completely flubs his chance. Looks like he’s not the wizard with his feet we were told he is.

11 Have I used the word “nothing” yet in this report?

9 Gerrard runs into the box and crosses for Crouch, who uses Miguel’s back to give himself a height advantage. Foul.

7 Miguel crosses from hte right but too long. Now we see Scolari yelling instructions to his players. The crosses seem a poor approach, since no one seems to be waiting for them when they come.

6 Crouch sticks a long leg out in defense to deny Ronaldo a chance to get on a pass from Miguel.

4 Portugal break, though slowly. All it leads to is a long, long shot by Simão. Well wide. That doesn’t look like a winning strategy.

3 Now England have a corner. Lampard aims at Crouch’s head. Nothing doing.

2 Ronaldo takes an age to launch a shot, it’s blocked. Then Petit puts one towards the stratosphere. It’s stopped by the roof of the arena.

1st minute of added time We’re off again. England down a man, but of course Portugal’s hardly rested after that gruelling match with Holland.

Full-time! England’s plucky lads will have to last another half hour down a man, and my plucky fingers will have to describe it all for you. We’re off to added-time.

90+3 Now Portugal counter, through Ronaldo, who flicks it across the face of goal, where it’s headed back by Postiga for Maniche, who can only punt it over.

90+1 Lennon wins a corner for England on the right. Lampard over it… Ricardo punches it clear but England get the ball back int he box and win another corner. Another punched clearance by Ricardo.

90 Now Manuche shoots weakly at Robinson. Everyone’s looking tired. And they’re not even typing.

89 Postiga takes a dive near the top of the box. No one not related to him believes he was fouled.

88 Now Postiga shoots weakly from the top of the box. How long can this go on? England’s defenders must be praying themselves that this does not go to extra time.

87 Ronaldo sends in a cross from the right and only JUST misses Postiga’s head. That was close.

86 Now Postiga is up on the side lines and he’s in for Figo, who no doubt will be looking for a good place to pray.

84 Figo takes about an hour to wind up for a shot above the box and, not surprisingly, it’s blocked. We may be headed for extra time, which is bad news for my aching fingers.

83 Indeed he can, but Ricardo jut parries it and Lennon pounces on the rebound, but shoots poorly right to Ricardo.

82 Up the other end a free kick above the box for England. Lampard over it. Can he miss again?

81 Miguel lays it off at the top of the box for Viana, who shoots but straight at Robinson.

80 Now Viana’s down and England play on with a man advantage. Viana’s got his eyes closed, did he take a poke from Crouch’s elbow? Or was he just trying to play for time to get Valente back on?

78 Figo! Nearly scores with a chip towards the far post, not clear if it was a pass or a shot, but it narrowly missed Ronaldo’s head. Valente is down and off the pitch by the England goal, so it’s 10 on 10 now.

76 Maniche takes a shot from way, way outside. Not close.

74 Here comes Hugo Viana, NOT Postiga, for Tiago. Sorry, my mistake. He’s a médio not anavançado so it’s a straight swap.

74 Gerrard sprints down the left and crosses, but Crouch’s legs are not apparently 15 feet long.

72 Neville saves England, clearing the ball right in front of goal after a cross in from the right. Portugal get ready to introduce another avançado, Hélder Postiga

71 Amazingly, England is now playing better a man down. Apparently its very hot in the arena, so having two subs on might be an advantage at the moment.

70 Hargreaves gts in the box on the left and looks for Crouch’s noggin. The cross goes wildly over though.

69 Ronaldo actaully screams as he’s taken down by Lampard. Foul but no card. I say that becuase in Valentin Ivanov was in charge of this match, it’d be six a side by now.

67 England’s fans are singing God Save The Queen, but it doesn’t help and Portugal work the ball down for a corner. That’s wasted though by Figo who gets a wide open shot from the left after it pings around a bit, but skies it.

66 Uh-oh, England’s in an offensive Crouch. The tall one is on for Joe Cole. Neville tries throwing it off his head in front of goal right away. No good.

65 Now Cole’s down and looking to get the sides even upped. The ref calls a foul but no card.

64 Having evoked Godot, now it’s all happening. Simão comes on for ineffective Pauleta and Portugal have a man advantage to work with.

62 Near scrap as Rooney idiotically pushes Ronaldo and.. he’s off! Was it for the foul on Carvalho who dragged him down or the push? Rooney was pulled down by Carvalho, but he then immediately stepped on Carvalho’s tender parts AND pushed Ronaldo right in front of the ref. What an absurd error.

61 Portugal counter-attack and Valente nearly finds Paulketa charging in towards goal.

59 Lennon! He causes Portugal all sorts of problems running down the right and cutting back into the box. Rooney whiffs it after a pass, then Cole skies it well over. England’s best chance by far created entirely by Beckham’s replacement.

57 Gerrard has a corner for England. Ricardo comes out to take it, and does. Now Maniche is down, no whistle and England is upset that Maniche is clutching his face for no reason at all.

56 Have I mentioend that nothing is happening in this match. Like the second act of Waiting For Godot, this is nothing happens, twice.

54 Beckham in tears on the sideline, clutching his leg. Maybe he really is hurt. Either way, many commentators in England think they’re better with Lennon than Beckham.

53 Corner to England. Gerrard finds Lampard standing alone in front of goal and he… bounces a volley over the bar. What is wrong with that man?

52 Now Beckham’s off for Lennon. ESPN seem to think it’s all about an injury to Beckham. More likely its about improving the England side.

51 Beckham has the abll up the otehr end and he flicks the ball up off the arm of Nuno Valente. No hand ball called.

51 Figo to Tiago who puts the ball in from hte top of the box expecting Pauleta to make a run. No run. Chance wasted.

49 Ronaldo throwing in some Nike-trademarked step overs on the left. Leads to nada.

48 Looks like Aaron Lennon is getting ready to come in for England. Apparently Svennis can’t stand this tedium either. Could it be for Beckham?

47 Beckham hurls himself into Nuno Valente and gets a free kick for his efforts to frame Valente.

46 Again, we’re off. Again, a minute of absolutely nothing happening.

HALF-TIME MUSINGS

Well, fat lot of nothing going on so far, really. The only major development: both John Terry and Petit can forget about playing in the semi, since they’ve both just earned their second yellow cards of this phase. With Costinha coming back, Portugal should weather that nicely, should they go through. Terry would likely be replaced by Sol Cambell, who last distinguished himself failing to deal with a throw in that led to a goal by Sweden, so England’s fans won’t be too happy about that.

FROM THE READERS

Foxhill, that remark about Rooney’s pretty face was indeed a joke. Roonaldo’s no Cristiano Ronaldo, who looks the part of a boy-band star. And Benjamin, I don’t know if you’re right to say “England are too good to be this boring.” Leaving aside the fact that it might be more correct to say “England is … boring” rather than “England are … boring,” at least in the American variant of the language, we just might have to judge them not on the hype pumped at us by ABC/ESPN but on the evidence of how they play. And they do indeed play like a side that is not too good to be this boring.

45+1 Figo goes down as if he’s been crucified at the other end. The ref’s seen it all before, though and refuses to blow his whistle for a foul. Now he blows it for half-time.

45 Suddnely it’s all England. Lampard shoots again! Right at Ricardo. That’s a shocker.

44 Not much made of it, but now Petit takes down Cole and we’ll have a free kick from right above the box… straight into the wall and out for a throw.

43 Hargreaves wins a corner, and maybe friends, on the left. Beckahm over it…

41 Robinson escapes a terrible faux pas. Off a corner the ball’s played in to Tiago who heads towards the far post, but Robinson knocks it down when he should’ve left it or caught it. No one there to punish him though.

40 England ahve the ball and lots of players near the top of the box, but make nada of it.

39 Figo! He leaves Lampard for dead at the top of the box on the left and then curls in a shot. Wide. But Lampard continues to look very poor.

37 Neville surges up the right and then stops. England work the ball back into their own end. They hear whisltes and respond by launching the ball back up to Gerrard, who crosses from the left, for no one.

35 Hand ball called on Hargreaves. He look miffed for some reason. Could be because he’s Canadian and plays in Germany and is said to have few friends on the English team. Besides coach Sven-Goran Eriksson, that is.

34 Tiago is upset that Cole fell over over after he tapped him and lets him know it.

32 Miguel, who doesn’t seem to be aware that he’s a defender, makes yet another run down the right and crosses into the box. He can’t find Pauleta though and has a moment, while Robinson prepares to hoof the goal kick, to get back down the pitch to his position.

28 Ronaldo, makes Lampard look foolish on the left. He makes space, has a shot, gets the ball back after it’s blocked and then is hacked down by Lampard. No call though and from the run of paly Terry and Tiago knock heads and are down briefly. Terry gets a Yellow Card for the challenge and now will miss the semi, if England get there.

27 Not exactly pressure from England, but they are playing mainly in Portugal’s end now. Though as soon as I typed that they played it back into their own and and then booted the ball out to give it to Portugal.

24 Rooney, back defending, nearly takes a kick in the face from Tiago. He better watch that pretty face if he wants to pile up the endorsements.

22 Gerrard catches Ronaldo on the break down the right, knocking the ball out for a throw. Maybe the man named for Ronald Reagan is not really at full-speed after that knock in the last match.

21 Gerrard puts in a beautiful ball to Lampard sliding in right in front of Ricardo but, guess what, he doesn’t get there.

19 Figo does now appear to be everywhere. He’s back in his own box to defend, clears the ball from Rooney and then leads the break the other way with a long pass to Ronaldo on the left. Ronaldo makes space, doesn’t like the angle, makes some more space and then shoots well over.

18 Both Beckham and Valente claim a throw as the ball goes out on the right of Portugal’s goal. The ref’s assistant gives Valente a comically pain look as he awrds the throw to England.

17 England build up from the back, though it takes them a while to do it and they hear some whistles from the crowd. Now Rooney cuts the ball back in front of goal, but no one’s there for England.

15 Hargreaves takes down Figo. Scolari unhappy not to see a card there. Continuing his Gene Hackman impersonation from the dugout.

14 Bechham’s called for a hack on Nuno Valente. Free kick on the left. Portugal work the ball into the box, but make nothing of it. England look shaky at the back so far.

13 Free kick on the right to Portugal. It falls in front of Tiago, who is one step from being in position to make it 1-0.

11 Maniche. He does little, but it’s a great name. Ronaldo’s clattered into from behind by Hargreaves and then swings in a cross from the reulting free kick. No one there.

9 Rooney has a shot, wide open above the box on the left, but right at Ricardo. The Portuguese break the otehr way and Ronaldo does just the same, shooting straight at Robinson.

8 Lampard pops up in the middle of an English move — and immediately pops the ball wildly across and right out.

6 Free kick to England. Beckham over it on the left. ABC ready to lose its collective mind. The kick comes to not much, but Gerrard gets it on the right and crosses in for Terry, just over his head in front of goal.

4 ‘Roonaldo’ at one end and then Ronaldo at the other, sprint to get on to long balls. Neither gets to them, but they look healthy enough.

3rd minute Ronaldo knocked down by his Man U teammate Gary Neville.

1st minute Figo goes past Ashley Cole on the right but fails to walk on water and loses the ball. Rooney has a quarter-chance, his shot’s blocked.

Kick-off!

10:58 amThe teams take the pitch. ESPN continues to over-hype England by replaying, for the four millionth time, Beckham’s free kick against Ecuador. Now they add Ronaldo’s tears as he left the pitch in the match against Holland.

10:35 am EST PREVIEW

WELCOME BACK TO OUR LIVE BLOG COVERAGE OF DEUTSCHLAND 2006

Rob Mackey here in the Times play-by-play booth, within 4,000 miles of the action set to take place today beneath the closed roof of the Arena AufSchalke in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. From this perch, thanks to the twin miracles of television and WiFi, I’ll be bringing you live updates on today’s quarter-final match up between under-performing England and under-manned Portugal

If you’ve got something to say that’s relevant, or irrelevant and somehow flattering to me, please do say it, either by taking advantage of the comments box below or by sending us an e-mail at worldcup@nytimes.com.

WHAT’S AT STAKE

To the winner, a place in the semis against either France or Brazil. To the loser… well, that depends on who loses. If it’s England, cue the traditional gnashing of teeth and prepare for the wailing about how football may never be coming home, etc. If it’s Portugal, at least according to their coach, Luiz Felipe “Big Phil” Scolari, no one will mind very much. The Guardian reports that Scolari is telling everyone that his team has already achieved their goal just by getting to the quarters and quotes his plea to Portugal’s supporters to look on the bright side of life, no matter what happens today on the pitch: “We ask the fans to enjoy themselves whoever wins. This team are already victors. To be among the eight best is spectacular. Sun, shorts, to be able to take a beer after the game. What more do you want?” Spoken like a true Brazilian, and a man who knows how important it is to take the pressure off his squad.

PRE-MATCH RELIGIOUS NEWS

Close readers will recall that Luiz Felipe Scolari explained after his team’s last match that Portugal’s 33 year-old midfielder Luis Figo “isn’t Jesus Christ.” According to press reports this week, Figo himself has taken to denying his divinity, telling reporters: “Every game could be my last game…. I’m not eternal.” Coach and player striving to make this point clear does make some sense, since religion and sport often get mixed up in an ardently Catholic country like Portugal. Scolari himself is said to always keep with him two statuettes of his favourite saints, Our Lady Of Fatima and Our Lady Of Caravaggio (Fatima being in Portugal and Caravaggio being well-represented in the part of Brazil Scolari comes from). In 2004, Figo watched his teammates defeat England in a dramatic penalty shoot-out to advance to the semi-finals of the European championships after he’d come off for a substitute. AFP reported at the time that “Figo cradled an image of Fatima in his hands as he sat in the dressing room.”

Apparently though all this talk about the divine Fig has just confused English midfielder Steven Gerrard, who told the press this week that it was important for England to “stop Figo playing” because “if you give Figo time and space, he’ll crucify you.”

A LOOK AT THE TEAMS

Portugal, are of course without the two key players who were sent off during their victory over Holland, médios Costinha and Deco. Deco’s two yellow cards in that match were both preposterous but, despite Sepp Blatter’s personal condemnation of the referee who handed them out, the disgraced Valentin Ivanov, FIFA told Portugal to “forget it” when they asked to have Deco’s suspension lifted for this match. So Deco will be watching this one from the sidelines, though presumably not while sitting on a step alongside Giovanni van Bronkhorst and Khalid Boulahrouz.

Speaking of Boulahrouz, his kind gift to England, as if trying to out-do that of mad-cap referee Ivanov’s suspension of Deco, was the injury he caused Portugal’s dangerous winger Cristiano Ronaldo in the first minutes of that previous match with a violent tackle that set the tone for what was to follow and eventually drove Ronaldo off the pitch in tears. Ronaldo’s in the startign line-up, but if he’s still too injured to take a leading part in today’s action, England will be up against a Portuguese side missing three of its best players.

Despite these absences, Portugal will play in a 4-5-1 formation that is often really a 4-2-3-1, as nicely outlined for you in this previa gráfica from El Mundo. Here are the players who will start for Portugal (along with the club sides they represent for money, not love):

1 – Ricardo (Sporting Lisbon)

13 – Miguel (Valencia)

5 – Fernando Meira (Stuttgart)

16 – Ricardo Carvalho (Chelsea)

14 – Nuno Valente (Everton)

8 – Petit (Benfica)

18 – Maniche (Chelsea)

7 – Luís Figo (Inter Milan)

19 – Tiago (Lyon)

17 – Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United)

9 – Pauleta (Paris Saint-Germain)

England will step onto the pitch and try very hard not to think about the fact that for the third successive major tournament they must face a team coached by Big Phil Scolari in the quarter-finals. In 2002, England lost at this stage of the World Cup to Scolari’s Brazil. England fell at the same hurdle of Euro 2004, crashing out with a loss to Scolari’s Portugal on penalties. While doing their best not to be spooked by the presence of Big Phil on the sideline, the English players might find it more difficult not to notice that the man standing in front of Portugal’s goal today, Ricardo, is the same keeper who won that remarkable penalty shoot-out in Lisboa two summers ago, by first saving one shot and then getting up and converting a kick of his own.

So far the English have been lucky to advance while playing quite poorly against sub-par opposition. Today’s match might not be the test it could have been against a full-strength Portugal, but the general feeling is that England have to improve if they want to keep winning and start to really excite their fans. While the English team has never been supported by the whole of the United Kingdom (one of the quirks of the world system, and the U.K., is that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own national teams and Scots in particular tend to root against England) here is a comment from the BBC Web site that gives a flavor of how the poor play of this England squad so far has undermined their standing with non-English fans in London:

“The England team are a disgrace – sub rock star figures too consumed by their own celebrity and too busy raking in huge endorsements or making comedy programmes to actually play high tempo, flowing football. The world looks on and laughs and quite rightly so. … Winning ugly is an aspiration devoid of all the soul, passion and occasional beauty that superlative football can offer. Let Scolari end this circus on Saturday for another two years.”

In fact the anti-England sentiment is so strong that even FIFA president Sepp Blatter has criticized England’s play as “negative” up till now. Then again, given that Sepp Blatter’s other ideas include brain waves like suggesting that woman should play the game in skimpy shorts to attract more viewers and that kick-ins should replace throw-ins, there must be something wrong with this idea too.

As Rob Smyth put it on the Guardian’s World Cup Podcast yesterday, England’s coach Sven-Goran Eriksson has just recently “stumbled” on to the 4-5-1 formation that seems to work best with this squad of players, but this can also make his side’s games stultifyingly boring to watch. Portugal also play a version of 4-5-1, but so far in the tournament, Portugal’s midfielders have moved the ball about and attacked in a way England’s have not. As Steven Gerrard explained to the press yesterday, the 4-5-1, with a holding midfielder like Owen Hargreaves at the back, theoretically should allow him and Frank Lampard to push forward more: “the idea is to get me and Frank into goal-scoring positions. If you look at our performances all season, you’ll see what we’re trying to achieve. If I’m asked to play with Frank in a 4-4-2, I’ve got to be careful about when I go forward because I know Frank’s going to go all the time. The holding player gives me a licence to get forward and try to make things happen in that area of the field, which is where I feel I produce my best stuff.” The only problem with all this is that, so far, Lampard, who was runner-up to Ronaldinho in FIFA’s World Footballer of the Year poll for his work at Chelsea, has been the least effective attacker in the entire tournament — leading all players in shots taken, with 22, but tied with most of them for dead last in goals scored, with 0.

The very different sorts of games these two teams have played so far make me, as a neutral, agree with El Mundo that this shapes up as a “duelo de dos formas de concerbir el fútbol. Centro del campo fuerte y juego poco lucido por parte de los británicos, y fútbol atractivo y rápido por los ibéricos.” Personally, that leaves me rooting for los ibéricos who seem far more likely to play an entertaining match against France or Brazil on Wednesday. That said, I’d be happy to see England break out of their collective torpor and prove that they’re not just a collection of talented individuals. It’s just that I, unlike the boys at ABC, am not expecting it.

After that lengthy preamble, let’s have a look at the players who’ll start for England today (again, along with their current club sides):

1 – Paul Robinson (Tottenham Hotspur)

2 – Gary Neville (Manchester United)

5 – Rio Ferdinand (Manchester United)

6 – John Terry (Chelsea)

3 – Ashley Cole (Arsenal)

7 – David Beckham (Real Madrid)

8 – Frank Lampard (Chelsea)

16 – Owen Hargreaves (Bayern Munich)

4 – Steven Gerrard (Liverpool)

11 – Joe Cole (Chelsea)

9 – Wayne Rooney (Manchester United)

The referee at the Arena AufSchalke today is Horacio Elizondo, last seen comically falling down while over-ruling the offside call near the end of the Switzerland-Korea match. Elizondo is now one of just two prominent Argentines still left in the tournament. Anyone know who the other one is? Also, while I’m asking for help, can anyone explain to me what on earth this TV commerical, featuring Portugal’s keeper Ricardo, is all about?
