In the latest move by a large corporation into New York City's troubled garbage hauling industry, Waste Management Inc., the nation's biggest recycling company, said yesterday that it had agreed to a $200 million deal to buy one of the city's largest recycling and trash-collection companies.

The acquisition comes amid a broad crackdown by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and law enforcement officials on organized crime that officials charge has controlled much of the garbage hauling, disposal and recycling industry for 50 years.

Officials said the company being acquired in the latest deal, Resource N.E., had not been touched by allegations of mob influence. But Waste Management executives said they would not have decided to enter the New York City market at all unless they were convinced that organized crime had loosened its grip on the waste business.

"Our decision to enter the New York market is in large part attributable to the efforts of a number of local officials to make the marketplace more competitive," said Phillip B. Rooney, Waste Management's chairman.
