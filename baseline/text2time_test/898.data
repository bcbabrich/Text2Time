PATTEK--Harold, died peacefully at home on November 27. Born to Martha and Jack on April 15, 1929, Harry was a graduate of Cooper Union, and Yale University School of Fine Arts. He was heralded as a graphic designer in both his own practice, and as a retired professor of graphic design at the University of Massachusetts. He is survived by his loving children, Ezra, Anna Kent, and Simone Ortiz, his adored grandchildren Dillan and Alec Perez, and Mikaela Ortiz, his former wife Nina Pattek, and his beloved, Karen Bush. His passion for his art, adventure, and for capturing life to its fullest was an inspiration to all he touched. Our hearts are broken. 1/3
