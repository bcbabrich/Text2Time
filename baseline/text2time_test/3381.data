PepsiCo would also be taking on Quaker's food business, which it would probably sell, the executives said, though certain brands might be folded into PepsiCo's Frito-Lay snacks unit. Because the deal would be structured as a pooling of interests, the executives said, PepsiCo would not be able to sell any of the food businesses for two years.

The acquisition could be considered a major blow to Coke because it would make PepsiCo, the smaller of the two companies, a much more powerful rival by adding $1.8 billion in sales to PepsiCo's balance sheet.

Though not as extensive as Coke's, Pepsi's worldwide bottling and distribution system might allow it to increase sales by putting Gatorade in more than the 60 countries where it now sells. Nonetheless, some analysts have questioned whether Gatorade will be as popular in Europe and Asia as it has been in the United States, one reason that Coke backed away from buying Quaker.

However, at $13.7 billion, the price is a relatively fair one, most analysts agree, and will not hurt Pepsi's earnings. That was a big consideration for Pepsi, analysts say, since the company has only recently come under Wall Street's good graces by consistently meeting analysts' growth forecasts. In setting a reasonable acquisition price for Quaker, few analysts expected Roger Enrico, Pepsi's chairman and chief executive, to risk that hard-won standing.

Securing Gatorade would round out Pepsi's lineup of some of the best-performing noncarbonated brands. It already has the leading position in the iced tea market with its Lipton Brisk, as well as the dominant stance in the relatively new iced coffee segment with its Starbuck's Frappuccino line.

Even more significant, its Aquafina brand of bottled water, a category responsible for roughly half of all the growth in the noncarbonated soft drink business, is the industry leader; Coke's offering in the field, Dasani, is in eighth place.

''Pepsi has already begun to move very aggressively in the noncarbonated area,'' said John Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter. ''The addition of Gatorade would be a huge enhancement to that strategy.''

In many ways, Quaker fits better within Pepsi than Coke, analysts say. Because of its Frito-Lay snack food business, which accounted for roughly 60 percent of its $18.7 billion in revenue last year, analysts have long believed that Pepsi would face a far less cumbersome task absorbing Quaker's packaged food division. Some Quaker products have shown little growth potential recently, especially cereals. But other areas have proven more promising, particularly Quaker's line of convenience foods, like granola bars.
