Ten years and a lifetime ago, L. Dennis Kozlowski reigned as the archetype of avarice. This helped lead to his conviction in 2005 for looting nearly $100 million from Tyco, for which he served six and a half years in prison. That showy shower curtain was in his corporate residence on Fifth Avenue — paid for with Tyco funds — and came to symbolize a life of unabashed excess. Mr. Kozlowski wasn’t the only corporate executive of his era who was convicted for fraud and other wrongdoing. Some of the others include:
