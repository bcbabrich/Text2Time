Elliott Abrams has said that his view of the world is based on one premise. The world is, he once said, ''an exceedingly dangerous place.''

Before his nomination today as head of the State Department's Latin America bureau, Mr. Abrams had reason to find out.

Since 1981, he has been head of the department's Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs. And in that job, Mr. Abrams, 37 years old, has been responsible for documenting illegal detention, torture and murder throughout the world.

Under the Reagan Administration, the post was considered to be among the least desirable in the State Department. Mr. Abrams was forced to walk a tightrope between human-rights activists, who supported the strong human-rights policies of President Carter, and conservatives who said it was more important for the United States to check Soviet power.
