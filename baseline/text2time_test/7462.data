JACKSON, Miss., June 30—The director of the Mississippi Summer Project announced today that civil rights workers would be sent into the southwest part of the state despite reports that white terrorists are armed with automatic weapons and hand grenades.

Bob Moses,. who arrived here today from Ohio, said adult staff workers would go first into Natchez, McComb and Amite County and it would be decided later whether to permit students in the area.

The southwest corner of the state is considered potentially more dangerous than Neshoba County, in the central section, where three civil rights workers have been missing for nine days and are feared dead.

Five Negroes have been reported killed in the southwest counties in the last six months. Others have been flogged and threatened. There have been bombines and cross‐burnings.
