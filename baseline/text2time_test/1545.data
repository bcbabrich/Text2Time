One of the interesting findings of a recent study conducted on amateur golfers by Neil Wolkodoff, the director of the Center for Health and Sport Science at the Rose Medical Center in Denver, is that golfers generally score lower while walking with a pushcart or a caddie as opposed to riding in a golf cart. There could be a multitude of reasons for this, but one proposed by Wolkodoff centered on the idea that walking golfers have more time — and a built-in, physical, stress-reducing response to a poor shot.

“If you’ve just hit a really bad shot and it sends you into a tizzy,” Wolkodoff said, “from a psycho-physiological standpoint, I can’t think of a worse thing to do than hop into a cart that whisks you to your next shot in seconds.”

Wolkodoff suggested, if it is possible and without overdoing it, that you walk to your next shot.

“Even one minute walking down a fairway will probably do a lot to get rid of the adrenaline and stress hormones that get into your system when you’re upset,” he said. “The physical nature of walking flushes the system and has a calming effect. You can reclaim your rhythm. It’s a natural response as opposed to a rushed one.”

Makes sense, but I wonder, what happens if both players in a cart hit bad shots? One, I guess, drives slowly.
