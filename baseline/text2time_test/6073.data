ISLAMABAD, Pakistan. July 2 (AP)—Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and opposition party negotiators agreed today on a plan for new elections designed to quell four months of political unrest.

Spokesmen for the two sides said that the agreement now must be approved by the central council of the opposition Pakistan National Alliance, but that a formal version could be signed within two days.

The agreement is intended to end the upheaval that began after the March 7 national elections when the alliance charged that Mr. Bhutto's ruling Pakistan People's party had rigged the voting. More than 300 people died in anti‐Govornment rioting after the election and major cities were placed under martial law.

The alliance negotiator, Ghafoor Ahmed, said that a formal version of the pact, if approved by the central council, would be signed by Mr. Bhutto and the alliance leader, Maulana Mufti Mahmood.
