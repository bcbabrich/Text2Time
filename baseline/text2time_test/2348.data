"Professor Wai-kam Ho was one of the great scholars of the field in the depth of his investigations, his command of the literature -- the vast literature of not only Chinese art history, but also historical texts, regional gazetteers, collections of poetry, random jottings," he said. "He was famous for his ability to delve both deeply and broadly to tease out information from these historical sources, which weren't always an obvious place to look for information."

Wai-kam Ho was born on March 26, 1924, in the Guangdong Province of China. He received an undergraduate degree from Lingnan University in 1947 and did graduate work with Chen Yinke, considered the pre-eminent historian of modern China.

In 1950 Professor Chen secretly arranged to send Mr. Ho to the United States to study art history; Mr. Ho received a joint master's degree in Chinese history and Asian art from Harvard in 1953. From 1959 to 1983, he was curator of Oriental and Chinese art at the Cleveland Museum; from 1984 to 1994 he was Laurence Sickman Curator of Chinese Art at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo.

As late as 1950, there was little serious scholarship of Chinese painting in the West. Chinese painting, which focused on landscapes, looked to Western eyes austere, forbidding and not representational enough. Weaned on portraiture, Western art historians found the landscapes almost impossible to interpret.

They were also difficult to date.

"When Wai-kam came to this country, the survival of actual examples of landscape paintings from the 10th and 11th centuries was widely questioned," Mr. Hearn explained. "Many people thought that everything that had survived were actually later copies that dated from the 15th and 16th centuries. There were all these paintings, but there was no way to prove that they were of an early date, so the whole field was in a terrible morass. It was through the work of scholars such as Ho that these paintings became anchored in time."
