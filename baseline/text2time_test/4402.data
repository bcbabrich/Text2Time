American Ballet Theater announced yesterday that it was canceling performances of "The Nutcracker" scheduled for Dec. 12-24 at the Performing Arts Center of the State University College at Purchase, N.Y. "We got off to a very late start," Robert Pontarelli, the company's director of publicity, said yesterday.

Ballet Theater reached an agreement in late September to use the college's studios for some rehearsals and performances, among them an annual holiday season of "The Nutcracker," using students in backstage capacities and providing company members as teachers.

Mr. Pontarelli said two months had not been enough time to market the season. "What's first and foremost at Ballet Theater is fiscal responsibility," he said. "We are not going to let stand any decisions that would jeopardize the financial stability of the company." Refunds are available through the box office at (914) 251-6200.
