UPDATE [Friday, December 5]:You can still test yourself with these questions, but the experiment is over. The answers and the results are here.

Even if you’re not in the mood right now for movie popcorn, take a moment to check out the offerings above. They’re from an quick experiment I’ve borrowed from some researchers featured in my Findings column and an accompanying Lab post. By estimating the sizes of these bags you could win something better than movie popcorn by participating.

As you can see, the small bag at the left has 24 ounces of popcorn and sells for $1.50 at the TierneyLab Multiplex. We have a couple of questions for you:

1) Quickly estimate, by eye, the the amount of popcorn in each of the Medium, Large and Extra Large sizes. 2) How much would you be willing to pay for each of the Medium, Large and Extra Large sizes?

You can post your answers as a comment. (For each question, just write down the numbers, separated by commas, starting with Medium and ending with Extra Large.) I’ll be discussing the researchers’ work here Tuesday. Later in the week I’ll discuss these popcorn bags and the results of the experiment. And, to show our appreciation for your contribution to science, the Lab judges will award one gift of gourmet popcorn — or some other treat if you don’t like popcorn at all — to a respondent chosen at random. (You can indicate your preferred brand of popcorn or other comestible.)

UPDATE [11:35 p.m., Monday]: We’ve just made some changes in the experiment, and if you already participated earlier today, you can do so again now. Please note in your comment if you already submitted answers earlier today.
