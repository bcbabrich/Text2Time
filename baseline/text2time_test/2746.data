Farmers expect to expand the planting of genetically modified crops in the United States this year, according to the results of a survey of farmers' intentions released yesterday by the Agriculture Department.

The survey, however, indicated that farmers are shying away a bit from crops resistant to Monsanto's Roundup herbicide, other than soybeans. The survey found that herbicide-resistant cotton would decline to 54 percent this year from 58 percent of total cotton acreage last year. Herbicide-resistant corn would increase only to 12 percent of acreage from 11 percent, it predicted. The herbicide-resistant category includes brands besides those made by Monsanto, but its Roundup-ready class accounts for most of them.

It is not clear if the slowdown is a reaction to recent concerns that widespread use of Roundup-ready crops are causing some weeds to become resistant to the herbicide.

A Monsanto spokeswoman said that the company's sales figures indicated that use of Roundup-ready corn and cotton was still growing.
