Week Three of the Christine O’Donnell comic hostage crisis: As promised, Bill Maher pressed on with his Friday night embarrassment-by-installment campaign. He’s trying, and failing so far, to goad Delaware’s Republican/Tea Party candidate for Senate into appearing on his current HBO show, “Real Time,” by airing wacky comments from her appearances on his old ABC show, “Politically Incorrect.”

Race Profile The Delaware Senate Race The Tea Party movement scored another victory when it helped propel a dissident Republican, Christine O’Donnell, to an upset win over Representative Michael N. Castle.

The latest clip, like the first one where she explains her teenage flirtation with witchcraft, reveals her affinity for religious experimentation — not to mention Italian food.

“I was dabbling in witchcraft, I’ve dabbled in Buddhism,” said Ms. O’Donnell. “I would have become a Hare Krishna but I didn’t want to become a vegetarian … because I’m Italian and I love meatballs.”

In an interview with Christian Broadcast News this week, O’Donnell was firmly in the Christian, rather than Krishna, camp, saying that God was keeping her in the race.

“We marched on because we knew God was not releasing us to quit,” she said, adding about the prospect of joining Congress immediately after the election, “and now with such an important lame duck session you realize why we were to endure all that stuff.”

Social conservatives consider O’Donnell’s ability to talk about her “faith journey” the key to what makes her a compelling new voice, as The Times’s Mark Leibovich wrote.

O’Donnell, who got her start as a nationwide personality with 22 appearances on Maher’s show, told Leibovich that her dad dabbled in comedy himself. He was Philadelphia’s Bozo the Clown.
