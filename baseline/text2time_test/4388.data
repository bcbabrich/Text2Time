The Green Point Savings Bank of Flushing, Queens, said yesterday that it had settled a series of lawsuits by depositors challenging the bank's conversion to public stock ownership.

Under the settlement, the bank will send depositors a coupon for $500 off the closing costs of a mortgage and offer them the right to invest in a five-and-a-half-year certificate of deposit with an interest rate that is 65/100 of a percentage point higher than the bank is providing on its five-year account.

Green Point will also pay the lawyers for the depositors fees of as much as $3.9 million and a further $150,000 in expenses. Terms of the settlement and lawyers' fees must be approved in Federal Court in Brooklyn at a hearing on Dec. 12.

"This is the close of the final chapter of the conversion," said Rich Humphrey, a senior vice president of Green Point. The bank says it has done nothing wrong but is settling the suit to avoid litigation.
