At the Folksbiene Yiddish Theater, the vehicle creaks, but the ride packs enjoyment.

The company that bills itself as the nation's oldest Yiddish-speaking theater is off and running in its 82d year of continuous performances with ''The Blacksmith's Folly,'' a musical drama based on one of David Pinski's Yiddish classics, ''Yankl der Schmid'' (''Yankl the Smith'').

Playing until Jan. 18 and accompanied by simultaneous English and Russian translations through earphones, this is a work that poses a question -- can the leopard change his spots? -- and then proceeds to take its sweet time delivering a predictable answer.

But there is plenty of fun and pleasure along the way: neatly acted characters who radiate soul, a journey into both old-time theater and Ukraine of 1906, warm humor, concern for decency, sprightly and sentimental music and lyrics and the singing of a baritone named Alexander Gunko.

Mr. Gunko, a graduate of the State Conservatory of Music in Odessa in Ukraine, possesses a beautiful voice and the ability to imbue a song with depths of feeling; although he plays a subsidiary role, a character called The Stranger, this production wisely uses him as much as possible.
