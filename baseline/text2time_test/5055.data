Tyrone Jackson ran for two touchdowns as North Carolina State exploded for three quick second-period scores today, then held off Iowa for a 28-23 victory in the Peach Bowl, a game marred by 14 turnovers, 7 by each team.

North Carolina State (8-3-1) converted three of Iowa's mistakes into touchdowns, while the Hawkeyes came up with only 10 points from Wolfpack mistakes in the game, played in a steady rain.

Chuck Hartlieb threw three touchdown passes for Iowa (6-4-3), including one with just eight seconds left in the game, and set a Peach Boiwl record for passing yardage.

Hartlieb finished with 29 completions in 50 attempts for 428 yards. Four of his passes were intercepted. The yardage broke the mark of 401 by Jack Trudeau of Illinois in 1985.
