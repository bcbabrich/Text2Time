This week, the Mashantucket Pequot Indians will open a new building that will double the size of their Foxwoods casino. But even before the expansion, the tribe has become the region's clear center of gravity, with influence that extends from town halls to the State Capitol in Hartford.

In a small town used to small business, the casino's numbers speak for themselves. The Pequots made $26 million in gross profits in July, just on slot machines. By year's end, they expect to be one of the largest employers in the state, with 9,000 workers. Their new building will give the tribe 139,000 square feet of gambling space. They say this will give them the largest gambling operation in the Western Hemisphere, edging out the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, which claims to be the largest casino in the world. The power of all that money to buy up land has non-Indian residents worried.

Last month, in response to an inquiry from the three nearest towns -- Ledyard, Preston and North Stonington -- the Pequots said their long-term goal was to buy 8,000 acres and annex it to the reservation, more than quintupling the 1,850 acres of Federal trust land in the reservation's original boundary. The new lands would all but encircle the town halls of Ledyard and Preston.

"It's too much," said Ledyard's Mayor, Joseph A. Lozier. But Mr. Lozier, who describes himself as "pro-Indian" and "pro-Indian economic development," concedes that the growing power of the Pequots is not to be denied in the town of 15,000 population. "When you're making $26 million a month, it's, you know, what do you want this week?" Mr. Lozier said.
