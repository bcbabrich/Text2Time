To the Editor:

American journalism is so steeped in folklore and mythology that it is often nearly impossible to separate fact from fiction. Sylvia Orans (letter, July 9) repeats the persistent fable about William Randolph Hearst's purported cable to the artist Frederic Remington, whom he had sent to Cuba to provide illustrations of the United States war with Spain -- "You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war."

It makes a good story and catches the flavor of the "yellow journalism" practiced by Hearst. But there is no evidence, nor has there ever been any, that Hearst sent such a cable.

In "Sensationalism and the New York Press" (New York, 1991), John D. Stevens, professor of communication at the University of Michigan, noted that the apocryphal tale originated with James Creelman, a "bellicose" reporter for Joseph Pulitzer's New York World who was kicked out of Cuba in 1896 by the Spaniards because of his wildly irresponsible dispatches. Hearst apparently perceived this as a recommendation and lured him away from Pulitzer to write for Hearst's New York Journal.

Stevens observed: "Creelman's memoir is the only evidence for the infamous anecdote about Hearst's cabling Remington that he would provide the war. Although Creelman was in Florida at that time and gave no indication of where or how he learned this story, historians still repeat it. Neither Remington nor Davis" -- Richard Harding Davis, the correspondent, who then worked for Hearst -- "mentioned it, either in frequent letters home nor in later memoirs, and Hearst flatly denied the story."
