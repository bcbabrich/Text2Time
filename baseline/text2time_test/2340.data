To the Editor:

That your Dec. 28 reports of the tsunami's devastation shared the front page with an article about Wall Street bonuses reaching into the many millions of dollars left me dumbstruck.

My hope is that some of those year-end bonuses will find their way to those in such desperate need rather than to the Ferrari dealer or luxury real estate broker.
