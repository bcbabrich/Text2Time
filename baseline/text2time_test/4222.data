And not many people plant these trees now. They take too long to grow. "The Indians planted for three generations," Mr. Wickes said. "We plant for three weeks."

But the world needs these old souls. We need something that has lived through 300 years, like the white ash in front of Tony's Lobster and Steak House in Sparkill, which has a trunk 25 feet in diameter. It is 95 feet tall, and its crown spans 75 feet. The welcome mat in front of Tony's reads, "Home of the largest white ash tree in North America." (Which is no idle boast. I called the American Forestry Association in Washington, which keeps a National Register of Big Trees, and it really is!)

"It was a sapling when the pilgrims settled this area," said Janet Irizarry, who owns the restaurant with her husband, Rick.

Its old limbs are knobby with a fungus called anthracnose. Its rough bark is dotted with mushrooms -- a bad sign, because mushrooms thrive on decay. But the Irizarrys coax their beloved tree along, with regular prunings, water and fertilizer. They even put ribbons around it.

These old trees are like lucky people born with good genes -- who then get a couple of lucky breaks later on. Breaks like a spring trickling under the asphalt, or the Irizarrys.

A group of sixth graders from the Woodglen School in New City saved the oldest white oak in the county. They were picking up old tires and pulling shopping carts out of the woods on April 22, 1970 -- the first Earth Day -- and came upon a huge white oak in an overgrown field.

"We felt like we were looking at something prehistoric," said Francis Stein, who was the school's principal at the time. "Like a friendly dinosaur."
