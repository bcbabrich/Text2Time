Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students use New York Times articles to trace the causes, effects, and predicted impact of the Melissa e-mail virus. In small groups, students create diagrams of the information known thus far about the virus that will serve as ongoing timelines of this news story as it develops.

Alison Zimbalist, The New York Times Learning Network

Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Assess the impact of the Internet and e-mail in our society and around the world, focusing on both the capabilities and the dangers of these computer services.

2. Examine the causes, effects, and predicted impact of the Melissa virus as discussed in the first New York Times article about the virus, “New Fast-Spreading Virus Takes Internet by Storm.”

3. Trace the progress of the information known about the causes, effects, and predictions about the Melissa virus through several New York Times articles.

4. Construct diagrams, to also be used as information unfolds, that illustrate the progress of the news about the Melissa virus as relayed in the New York Times articles analyzed in class.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-classroom blackboard

-copies of “New Fast-Spreading Virus Takes Internet by Storm” (3/28/99; one per student)

-copies of “Super-Fast Computer Virus Heads Into the Workweek” (3/29/99; one per small group)

-copies of “Digital Tracks Yield Clues to Creator of Internet Virus” (3/30/99; one per small group)

-poster board or large sheets of construction paper (one per small group)

-markers

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/ DO-NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following questions (written on the board prior to class): What is the impact of the Internet and e-mail in our society and around the world? What capabilities do these computer services offer? To what “dangers” might they subject their users? Students then share their responses. Tell students that they will be investigating a new e-mail virus called “Melissa” that is rapidly affecting computers around the world, uncovering new details about the mysterious virus as they arise.

2. Read and discuss “New Fast-Spreading Virus Takes Internet by Storm,” answering the following questions:

a. What is the Melissa virus?

b. What does the Melissa virus spread, and what does it do?

c. How can one identify the Melissa virus, and how can one avoid contracting and spreading it?

d. What effects has the Melissa virus had on corporations that have somehow contracted it?

e. What are various computer companies, including Microsoft, doing to help eliminate the virus?

f. What are different people saying about the effects of the virus and ways in which it can be stopped?

g. What potential effects could the virus have on computers around the world?

h. Who is thought to be the creator of the virus at this point?

3. Divide students into small groups (three to four students each), and give each group a copy of each of the other articles about the Melissa virus. Beginning with the article read in class, each group answers the following questions about the information provided in EACH of the articles:

–What have been the effects of the Melissa virus?

–What is being done to help eliminate the virus?

–What reactions are people having to the virus?

–What expected outcomes and future implications of the virus are predicted?

–Who is thought to be the creator of the virus at this point, and why?

WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: On a large sheet of poster board or construction paper, each group constructs a diagram, in any way that they wish, that illustrates the progress of the news about the Melissa virus as relayed in The New York Times. Students should include their responses to each of the articles analyzed in class in chronological order on the diagram, and they should leave room (or create a diagram that facilitates easy addition on another sheet of paper) for adding information provided in future articles. Students should add to their diagrams whenever new information arises, creating a sort of ongoing timeline tracing the investigation into the causes and effects of the Melissa virus.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–What is a computer virus?

–What viruses have affected computers in the past?

–How can one avoid contracting a computer virus?

–What other “dangers” lurk on the Internet and through e-mail, and how can one avoid becoming affected?

–What new ventures and opportunities has e-mail created?

–What new opportunities has the Internet created?

–What potential opportunities exist with the increase of e-mail and Internet users worldwide?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on written journal response, participation in class discussions, analysis of several New York Times articles, and diagrams following the progress of information known about the Melissa virus.

Vocabulary:

rampage, exponentially, overwhelms, innocuous, byte, recipient, acceleration, encoded, dormant, virulence, disarm, automate, magnitude, reminiscent, vast, dovetails

Extension Activities:

1. Create a small booklet or pamphlet geared toward people your age and their families about protecting themselves when using e-mail and the Internet.

2. Examine how different computer viruses that have existed in the past have worked and their effects. Compare these viruses to what is currently known about the Melissa virus.

3. Contact several local businesses and organizations about the importance of e-mail, the Internet, and other computer programs to their company, and about the impact that the Melissa virus has had on them.

4. Create a glossary of computer terms compiled from various New York Times articles about the Melissa virus.

5. Analyze what different Web sites are saying about the Melissa virus and ways in which they are helping to protect customers from contracting the virus.

6. Continue to follow the news about the Melissa virus as the details unfold in The New York Times. Examine how different people are reacting to this virus and its potential by reading both news stories and editorial pieces.

7. Write a science fiction story about a computer virus and its effects on the world.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Mathematics- Use the Melissa virus’s reproducing power to examine exponents. Provide students with various word problems based on the way in which this virus spreads (if the document is opened, the virus sends itself to the first fifty people in that person’s e-mail address book).

Media Studies- Explore and compare how newspapers from different countries are covering the Melissa virus story. Ecola Newsstand (//www.ecola.com) is a tremendous resource of English-language newspapers and magazines around the world.

Science- Learn about how viruses are contracted by and spread in the human body. Then, create a comparison poster that draws parallels between human and computer viruses.
