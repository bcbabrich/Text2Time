He described the still-missing item as a headdress mask of the Tlingit tribe that had been collected in Alaska's Baranof Island. The item has a value of about $150,000.

The recovered items were found in the A.C.A. Galleries, at 25 East 73d Street, by detectives from the Police Department's intelligence division. They were acting on information from a confidential source, police officials said. Detectives said it had not yet been determined whether the gallery knew the artifacts had been stolen.

Last June 15, when the theft was made public, Dr. Roland W. Force, the museum's director, described the stolen objects as ''some of the finest pieces of their kind in existence.'' Stolen From Display Case

Dr. Force said he first noticed on June 13 that the artifacts were missing from their display case on the second floor of the museum, on Audubon Terrace at Broadway and 155th Street. But he said he had thought then that a member of the museum staff had simply moved the pieces.

The director said someone had removed the frame from the display case, slid the glass aside and taken five of the six pieces in the case. ''My supposition is that this was done by people who were very knowledgeable,'' he said at the time. The five pieces were small enough to be concealed under clothing, unlike the other item that was left behind.
