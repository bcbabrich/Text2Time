Coach Rick Pitino threw a challenge at the Knicks and they met it by defeating the Milwaukee Bucks, 113-103, tonight, in what Trent Tucker called ''our biggest victory of the season.''

The dare came when the coach completed the afternoon shootaround by saying: ''This game is going to be a barometer of how badly you want to make the playoffs. No more speeches, no more motivational talks; it's your ball game now.''

In posting only their fifth road victory in 35 games, the Knicks (31-40) moved a game behind the Philadelphia 76ers and two behind the Cleveland Cavaliers in the battle for the Eastern Conference's final two playoff spots. The Knicks have 11 games remaining, 6 on the road and 5 at home, where they have won 17 of their last 19 games. Knicks Shoot 53 Percent

The Knicks played some of their best defense of the season; they shot almost 53 percent from the field, 10 percent higher than they averaged in the previous four games against the Bucks; and they outrebounded Milwaukee, 51-39.
