MADISON, Wis. — Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany spent about an hour before Nebraska’s debut game in the Big Ten taking pictures with Cornhusker fans.

“Thanks for the invite,” repeated fan after fan, with their tone implying that they were happy to be out of the Big 12.

In an interview outside Camp Randall Stadium, Delany seemed to relish the scene he had helped create. An estimated 30,000 Nebraska fans poured into Madison for the game, and they helped make for a boisterous atmosphere.



“It’s more than you could hope for in a way,” Delany said. “We couldn’t have predicted the teams would open up undefeated.”

Delany said it could take five years to know whether the conference realignment frenzy has calmed in a significant way. He maintained that the Big Ten would not change just to change and lamented how a lot of the changes occurred.

“It’s not sometimes the decisions that you make that are so key, it’s the decisions that you don’t make,” he said. “Most injuries are self-inflicted, they’re not necessarily inflicted by others. Unfortunately in my view, while there’s always been some change, it hasn’t really been evolutionary, it’s been a little more revolutionary.”

Delany said that he sees leagues trying to force stability through increasing exit fees. “Usually those things happen as a result of comfort, not necessarily to ensure comfort and stability,” he said.
