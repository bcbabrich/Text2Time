There was so much talking between Ray Mercer and Jesse Ferguson in their Feb. 6 bout at Madison Square Garden that George Foreman, Larry Merchant and Jim Lampley, the HBO announcers, began to joke about the jawing.

Foreman, Merchant and Lampley were commenting on the fight in a warmup that was not for general broadcast. At one point, after Mercer had again spoken to Ferguson during a clinch, Foreman quipped, "I think he just made him an offer to quit."

That is apparently what a grand jury believed, too. Mercer, 32 years old, was indicted on a sports bribery charge, arrested in Indianapolis on Sunday night and arraigned on the felony charge Tuesday in Manhattan. He pleaded not guilty.

District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau contended that Mercer could be heard "repeatedly" on the tapes offering Ferguson a bribe to throw the fight. The district attorney said that Mercer had mentioned $100,000. Mercer, who lost the 10-round fight, had been guaranteed a title shot against Bowe, worth at least $1.5 million, if he were to defeat Ferguson.
