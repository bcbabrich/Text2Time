A deposition saying that a major heroin suspect received millions of dollars in cash was presented yesterday in the ''pizza connection'' trial.

The deposition came from testimony in Switzerland by Paul Waridel, a Swiss citizen who admitted collecting more than $11 million for the suspect in Switzerland. He identified the suspect as Yasar Musullulu, a Turkish fugitive accused of supplying morphine base for heroin to Mafia leaders in Sicily.

The deposition from Mr. Waridel, who is being held in Switzerland on related charges, was read to the jury in Federal District Court in Manhattan.

The prosecution contends that the 22 defendants in the trial operated a Mafia heroin ring that laundered many millions of dollars in drug money, including $20 million sent to Switzerland through trading accounts at E. F. Hutton and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith.
