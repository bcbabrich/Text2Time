Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Describe the similarities and differences between an empire and a republic; identify countries that can be categorized into each of these types of governments.

2. Explore current similarities between the United States and historic empires around the world by reading and discussing “All Roads Lead to D.C.”

3. Consider the impact of various empires throughout world history and develop a deeper understanding of what an empire is by researching historic empires and creating classroom posters that include timelines, maps and other graphics.

4. “Invent” their own modern-day or futuristic empires and create travel guides offering information about them to tourists.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-paper

-classroom blackboard

-copies of “All Roads Lead to D.C.” (one per student)

-resources examining the histories of various empires, including Greek, Roman, Persian, Chinese, French, Spanish and British (world history textbooks, library resources, computers with Internet access, etc.)

-six pieces of poster board

-markers

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Prior to class, write the following definitions from Merriam-Webster’s Word Central Online Dictionary on the board:

“Empire: a major political unit with a large territory or a number of territories or peoples under one ruler with total authority, especially one having an emperor as chief of state.

Republic: a government having a chief of state who is not a monarch and who is usually a president; a government in which supreme power belongs to the citizens through their right to vote.”

Upon entering class, students should read these definitions and respond to the following prompt in their journals (also written on the board prior to class): “What similarities and differences exist between these types of political structures? Do you think one type of political structure is better than the other? Why or why not? Which one of these structures does the United States have, and why do you think this? What other countries can you name that fit each of these two types of governments?” After a few minutes, students share their answers. Students likely classified the United States as a republic. How might it be argued that the United States is an empire?

2. As a class, read and discuss the article “All Roads Lead to D.C.,” focusing on the following questions:

a. What do many scholars believe is the international political role of the United States?

b. In what four ways is the United States a powerful force, according to the article?

c. What political label do foreigners give Americans, and why?

d. Are scholars accepting the ideas behind this label, and why?

e. How is Mr. Boot’s idea of an empire affected by the attacks of September 11?

f. What does Mr. Boot believe countries like Afghanistan need?

g. How is America’s “empire” different from empires of the past?

h. Where does Mr. Kaplan suggest politicians turn for guidance in the 21st century?

i. What does Mr. Kaplan believe will lead the United States to have more international power?

j. How did America show imperialist behavior during the colonial era?

k. What does Mr. Kennedy believe to be a clear sign that the United States is an empire?

l. How do scholars claim America “conquers” other nations?

m. What is a positive result of the United States being a large empire?

3. Explain that students will now be conducting research on different empires in history to deepen their understanding of what an empire is and how an empire can have both positive and negative effects on the countries and peoples around them. Divide students into six groups, and allow each group to choose a different empire mentioned in the article “All Roads Lead to D.C.”: Rome under Tiberius, Rome under Charlemagne, Persia, China, France under Napoleon and Spain under Philip II. (Note that you can extend this activity to include other historic empires as well.) Using all available classroom materials, each group should answer the following questions about their historic empire, and then create a classroom poster with the information (written on the board for easier student access):

–Where was your group’s empire located? Find a map that shows its location then, and locate on a current map where the empire’s boundaries would be now.

–How and when did this empire come into being? Create a timeline on your poster of major events in this empire from its inception to its fall. Include the names and dates of different key leaders of the empire.

–How was this empire structured in terms of its government? Create a flow chart explaining the “chain of command” during this time period.

–What were this empire’s international interests, and how did it act on those interests? What countries represent potential friends or enemies? Include this information graphically on the maps that you have included.

–What was this empire’s economic structure, and how was it related to its international interests?

–What cultural and technological developments occurred during and as a result of this empire? Locate pictures of different pieces of art, artists, musical instruments, technologies, scientific discoveries and other related developments from this empire to include on your poster.

If necessary, posters may be finished for homework or in a future class period. They should then be displayed around the world.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: With their new understanding of empires from the article read in class and from their group research, each student or group “invents” their own modern-day or futuristic empire and creates a travel guide offering information about it to tourists. Students should consider (and include in their illustrated guides) all of the questions posed in the historical empire research conducted in class. Students should present their empires in a future class.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–What were the Punic Wars, and how were they important to the development of the idea of imperialism?

–Do you think today’s politicians should read ancient Greek and Roman historical accounts for advice on how to run their nations? Why or why not?

–How do you think the United States uses economic, political and cultural forces to influence other nations? What examples can you offer?

–Do you think that American politics are turning foreigners into Americans? Why or why not?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on initial journal response, participation in class and group discussions, careful group investigation and thoughtful completion of historic empire posters, and creation of imaginary empires and travel guides.

Vocabulary:

dazzle, hegemony, empire, imperialist, eminent, isolationist, paeans, assertive, enlightened, jodphurs, pith, multipolar, merely, pagan, ethos, navigate, despot, tenacity, leverage, classicist, scoff, pax, anarchic, rogue, benign

Extension Activities:

1. In writing, create a debate between current or past scholars on whether or not the United States is an empire. List three arguments supporting the argument and three counterpoints with which the opposition might respond.

2. Research the United States’ current role in the world as an “empire” to another empire mentioned in the article. How does each nation compare to the definition of “empire” used in the initial classroom activity? How do these nations compare to each other? How can you account for these similarities and differences? Present your findings in the form of a newspaper article written in response to “All Roads Lead to D.C.”

3. With a partner, create a timeline of American foreign policy since World War I. (Places to begin looking include the Monroe Doctrine, Roosevelt Corollary, Kellogg-Briand Pact and Neutrality Acts.) Write a short explanation of any patterns you notice regarding the nation’s involvement in foreign affairs. Choose one issue, and research it further. Write a position paper explaining whether or not American involvement was necessary or justifiable in this situation, and present your findings in a future class.

4. In Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s “Quarantine Speech” (October 5, 1937), the President stated: “The peace, the freedom, and the security of 90 percent of the population of the world is being jeopardized by the remaining 10 percent who are threatening a breakdown of all international law and order. Surely the 90 percent who want to live in peace under law and in accordance with standards that have received almost universal acceptance through the centuries, can and must find some way … to preserve peace.” Do you believe it is more important for the United States to look out for the whole world, or to focus only on what threatens the country directly? Back up your response with facts from the article “All Roads Lead to D.C.” and additional research conducted in class. Present your written analysis in a future class.

5. Explore the United States military. How is it organized? How is it controlled? How do agencies like the C.I.A. and F.B.I. fit into the structure of the military? What role does military power play in the definition of “empire”? Create an encyclopedia or textbook entry with your responses.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Geography

-Create a world map showing the countries that the United States has been involved with since World War I. Incorporate symbols representing the reasons for American involvement.

-Research and collect proof that American culture is popular everywhere. What is the definition of American culture, and how is this manifested throughout the world? Create a chart showing how American institutions are represented in other cultures. (Examples might include music such as hip hop and pop, fast food chains such as McDonald’s and Pizza Hut, television show trends like reality television and game shows, and clothing such as Levi’s jeans and Nike sneakers.)

Journalism- Collect international headlines from newspapers or magazines for an entire week. How do your clippings justify or refute the position that the United States is an empire?

Media Studies- How do foreign media outlets present current United States foreign policy? Choose a situation in which the United States is currently involved in another country’s affairs, such as Afghanistan, Somalia, Israel, Cuba, Colombia and Nicaragua. Compare media coverage at News Directory (//www.newsdirectory.com), and write a report describing how the United States coverage of an event or region differs from other world coverage of the same event or region.
