Charles Barkley is not a fan of Michael Jordan’s tenure as owner and chief decision-maker for the Charlotte Bobcats.

“I love Michael, but he just has not done a good job,” Barkley said on “The Waddle & Silvy Show” on Thursday. “Even though he is one of my great friends, I can’t get on here and tell you he’s done a great job. He has not done a great job, plain and simple.”

Barkley even got specific, saying that his teammate on the 1992 U.S. Olympic basketball team erred in taking Gonzaga’s Adam Morrison over Washington’s Brandon Roy with the third pick in the 2006 draft.

“I said, ‘Michael, I think you should take Brandon Roy, and he said, ‘We like Adam Morrison,’ ” Barkley said. “I said, ‘Adam Morrison can’t play.’ ”

Barkley may have had a point, as Morrison averaged 7.5 points and 2.1 rebounds in 161 N.B.A. games before heading overseas while Roy averaged 19 points and 4.7 assists a game in 321 games before injuries prematurely ended his career.

It’s possible, however, that Jordan simply saw in Morrison an ability to win championship rings regardless of his actual basketball talent. While Morrison was unable to match Jordan’s six rings, he did win two as a bench player for the Lakers. For all of Barkley’s talent, he never managed even one.
