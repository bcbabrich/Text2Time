Add the world-renowned Riccardo Muti, who recently took over as the C.S.O.’s music director, and you have the sort of star-power lineup that, say, the Cubs have been seeking for years. Even more than sports teams, classical music needs that kind of celebrity these days.

No niche of the performing arts has felt the sting of the digital revolution more than music. The record industry has been damaged by easily copied MP3 files. IPods allow listeners to hear music all day, everywhere: no need to step into a concert hall or arena. As improved technology brings higher-quality downloads and high-definition video streaming, even the most persnickety orchestra and opera fans can find reasons to avoid live events: why contend with traffic, parking, audience sniffles or a plain old off-night on stage?

A 2008 study by the National Endowment for the Arts surveyed adults attending arts performances at least once during the previous year. Since 2002, the classical music audience has declined by almost 20 percent and the opera audience by 30 percent.

Susan Mathieson Mayer, director of communications for the Lyric, put the blame for the drop in attendance on cutbacks in arts education in public schools. “We survey opera subscribers continuously, and almost invariably they had some kind of exposure when they were kids: music lessons, parents taking them to concerts, et cetera,” she said. “Times are very different from 20 years ago. We’re dealing with maybe two generations who did not have the same kind of exposure that their parents did.”

Deborah F. Rutter, president of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra Association, identified another factor. “The competition for leisure time is so much more challenging than it was 20 to 30 years ago,” she said. In fact, given the lure of computer-driven entertainment, she finds it “fascinating that this passion and excitement still exist for the live concert experience.”

But that passion belongs to an increasingly older audience. The N.E.A. survey found that in 2008, nearly 40 percent of the symphony audience, and about 35 percent of operagoers, were older than 55. By comparison, the audience for Latin music, among the most popular idioms surveyed, counts only about 20 percent of its audience in that demographic.

Both Ms. Rutter and Ms. Mayer say their challenge lies in enticing younger audiences to show up a few times and then to turn that interest into habit, so that by the time they reach their 30s and 40s and have more disposable income, they might become regular attendees and even subscribers.

Ms. Rutter describes the strategy as “Trick them into loving you for the rest of time.” The C.S.O.’s student ticket policy is a case in point. For $10, registered students can reserve a ticket online weeks before a concert; when they show up, they get the best available seats. “They could be in a lower balcony seat that normally runs $120,” Ms. Rutter said, noting that last year the program attracted some 14,000 students.

The Lyric’s NEXT program sends an e-blast to college students announcing unsold tickets. “This past year we had probably close to 10,000 college students attending, at a cost of $20 a ticket” for seats that can sell for up to $200, Ms. Mayer said.

Some seemingly novel concepts are firmly rooted in centuries of tradition. Ms. Fleming hit on the idea of bringing Broadway to the Lyric last summer when she was in Vienna, visiting an exhibition about Gustav Mahler, the 19th-century composer and opera director. “Mahler was quoted as saying how excited he was to be presenting works by Mozart 100 years after they were written,” Ms. Fleming said. “I thought that would be a good place to start in the U.S. too,” with homegrown works from the previous century.

At Houston Grand Opera, Mr. Freud left his stamp with “The Refuge,” a 2007 production for which he commissioned a poet and a composer to interview hundreds of non-native Houstonians to learn their “journey stories” — how they ended up in the city — and turn them into a full-fledged production.

“On one level, you can regard opera as a 400-year-old European art form,” he said in Chicago the day after his hiring. ”But if you distill opera, it’s simply telling stories through words and music, and that transcends history and ethnicity.”

The Lyric has already dipped a toe in these waters, notably with the 2010-11 season’s finale, “Hercules.” The famed director Peter Sellars drew on weeks of workshops with American military veterans to transfer the story from ancient Greece to the modern United States, and to explore the difficulties that returning soldiers have in leaving the traumas of war on the battlefield.

Do such productions build audiences? At a reception following the opera’s dress rehearsal, which was attended by more than 75 of the military veterans who had worked with Mr. Sellars, several allowed that this was their first opera experience and that they did not really follow much of the action onstage. While it is unlikely that many of them will return, the production did attract major news media exposure.

Similarly, the inmates from Warrenville probably will not rush off to sign up for the new season at the Chicago Symphony when they are released. But the idea behind that program, and others in the orchestra’s ambitious Citizen Musician initiative, is to expand the audience indirectly, by building community ties. “By going beyond the seats in Orchestra Hall, they’re doing the right thing,” Mr. Ma said.

And such experiences leave their mark on the consulting musicians as well. “What a musician does is collect all these experiences and then report back in sound,” Mr. Ma said. “I know after this, the Dvorak Concerto sounds different when I play it. There’s more love there — more humanity.”
