The New York Yankees are expected to announce a change of ownership today at a noontime news conference at Yankee Stadium.

The identity of the prospective new owners was unknown last night, but it was reported that Michael Burke, the club president, had organized a group to purchase the team from the Columbia Broadcasting System, which bought the franchise in 1964.

Newsmen were summoned to what was described as a “manor” news conference today, but officially the Yankees had “no comment” on the nature of the announcement.

There have been reports recently that Joe DiMaggio, former Yankee star, might be part of a group seeking to buy the club as well as reports that Herman Franks, former manager of the San Francisco Giants, was head of a group seeking to purchase the team. These moves would leave Burke out of the picture.
