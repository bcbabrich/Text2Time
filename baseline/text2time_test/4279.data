The jury's mixed verdict in the deaths of four of the Treasury agents who raided the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex., has dealt another mortifying blow to Federal law enforcement. Just about the only person who does not view the verdict as a rebuke to the massive and unnecessary police action is Attorney General Janet Reno.

The raid, a year ago yesterday, was botched, as were most of the Government's efforts to arrange the surrender of the heavily armed cultist David Koresh. Along with dozens of his followers and their children, Mr. Koresh perished last April in a fiery response to a final raid, by the F.B.I.

The Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms launched its February attack even though it knew that the Davidians fully expected it. That would seem to suggest the cultists engaged in premeditated murder. But no; all 11 defendants were acquitted of murder. The jury did convict five defendants of manslaughter, holding them responsible for the deaths of the agents.

Under the judge's instruction, the lesser manslaughter verdict was justified if the accused acted "in the sudden heat of passion caused by adequate provocation." Thus the jury credited the five convicted cultists with an element of self-defense.
