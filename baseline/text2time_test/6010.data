SUICIDE, which was at CBGB's over the weekend, is a two‐man Sick band that has been around for several years but has just now—with most of the leading New York underground bands signed to major labels and distinct signs that people are looking for novelties beyond punk basics—begun to attract attention, particularly in Britain.

Suicide offers an act consisting of three elements. By far the most interesting are the electronic‐keyboard machinations of Martin Rev, who sets up a grinding, overlapping texture of ostinatos. Some of those short, repeated figures recall primordial rock riffs. But the basic effect is both brutal (largely a matter of the deafening volume) and complex,

If that were all there was to it, you would have something comfortably in the tradition of Klaus Schulze and the other German keyboard wizards, with a strong overlay of the Riley‐ReichGlass sort of motoric energy. But aside from the implied hostility of the vole, Suicide offers the contributions of Alan Vega, the singer.

Mr. Vega's work blends lurid melodrama with the miming of crazed hostility. The vocal sounds come close to screams, and are refracted into a kind of aural chamber of mirrors by a heavy admixture of echo and other distorting devices. The song subjects are full of murderous imagery and urban angst.
