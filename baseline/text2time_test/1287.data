The N.F.L. and its players have been throwing verbal barbs at each other in recent weeks as they try to work out a new labor agreement. The players union, though, appears to have lost at least one megaphone.

CBS College Sports Network has refused to air a commercial produced by the N.F.L. Players Association for Saturday’s Texas-America All-Star game, which is sponsored by the union.



As part of their nearly year-old agreement with the hosts of the event and College Sports Network, the union says it was promised two minutes of free air time with no content restrictions.

So it produced a 30-second and a one-minute commercial, the first cuts of which were given to the network in mid-January, according to George Atallah, a spokesman for the players union. He added that the network rejected them late last week, saying that it did not want to get in the middle of the dispute over the collective bargaining agreement.

The one-minute version of the commercial clearly flouts the union’s agenda. It features scenes of empty stadiums, locker rooms and gyms, and fans and players saying “let them play” and “let us play,” and an allusion to the threat of a lockout by the N.F.L. owners if a new labor deal is not reached by March 3.

At the end of the commercial, the screen reads, “Do Your Part to Let Us Play. Sign the petition at www.nfllockout.com//www.nfllockout.com/.”

“It’s unfortunate they seem to be scared off,” Atallah said of the network. “I hope this puts the spotlight on the college all-star game and the players who might be locked out.”

Dana McClintock, a spokesman for CBS College Sports Network, confirmed that the network did not want to take sides in the labor dispute, and that it wouldn’t run a similar ad from N.F.L. either. CBS is one of four networks that pays the N.F.L. $4 billion to broadcast their games.

Addressing suspicions that the network balked so as not to offend the league, Greg Aiello, a spokesman for the N.F.L. said the league did not know about the network’s decision and had no objection to anyone running the ad.
