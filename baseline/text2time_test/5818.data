Much of her day is spent with a phone warming her ear. Miss Ivory says there is no approved list of callers who are automatically put through to him, but she has picked up on the people he always talks to. Many of the callers are C.E.O.'s. ''It's sort of like a fraternity,'' she says. ''You recognize other C.E.O.'s. You always give them every courtesy. . . . It can be days or weeks before a call gets returned. Sometimes - it happens rather frequently - one of the C.E.O.'s or Mr. Waldron gets on the phone and there's dead silence. Neither one knows who's calling whom or what they're calling about.''

One of her regular duties, she goes on, is to advise Waldron twice a day - at 11 A.M. and at 4 P.M. - of Avon's stock price on the New York Stock Exchange. How does he react? ''When it's down,'' she says, ''he'll be mad. He'll say, 'Goddamn it, down again.' ''

WALDRON SHUFFLES through papers. It is afternoon. He says he has more work than he can keep up with. He says the problems at the beauty business are worse than he anticipated.

''I know we have to hit bottom,'' he says. ''I know there is a figure called minus 100. Sooner or later, we have to hit bottom.'' He says that he occasionally begins to feel as if he is adrift in some alien world. ''Sometimes you find it hard to believe that you're looking at those numbers over there,'' and he points to a chart of a downward sloping red line, ''and then you're having coffee over here with the Twenty-Five Year Club, one of those wonderful things I have to do. Sometimes it just doesn't seem to make a bit of sense.''

Shouldn't he be spending more of his time, all of his time, on the beauty business?

''There's an awful temptation to become preoccupied with a major artery severing,'' he says. ''You have to resist it. You have such responsibilities. If someone is going to sit in that chair'' -he motions toward his chair - ''and call himself a leader, he has to be a full-time leader and be a consistent leader and not cry or laugh or fly off the handle when that's not the right thing to do. Anyone who lets a personal problem or a business problem get to him and interfere with how he runs the company is not doing the job the way it ought to be done. So you have to go out to the dinners and look after the other children in the family and laugh and slap backs, even though you know there's an engine fire going.''

IT'S OFTEN SAID THAT C.E.O.'s are overly preoccupied with short-term considerations, that they are obsessed with what the bottom line will show three to six months in the future and with making those numbers bigger and bigger, at any cost.

''There is a fixation,'' Waldron tells me one day. ''And I think it's terribly unhealthy. I have the sickness, too.'' He pins the blame on securities analysts, who, he says, ''you can't get to think ahead more than six months. Some you can't get past the present quarter. Now, why is that the case? . . . Companies, like our own, have money managers . . . We bring these money managers in and put them through terrible torture once or twice a year. How's our money doing? And if they say it's gone phsssst, then we say, 'O.K., you've got one more quarter or we replace you with someone else.' And they scamper out and say, 'We've got to find some stocks that are going to go up.' So I think that's what's driving American business. . . .''
