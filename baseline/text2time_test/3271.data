Lance Johnson has 1,556 hits in a good major league career, 325 stolen bases, and he's led the American League or the National League in significant categories 10 times. But his performance in a minor league game Saturday may go a long way to determining whether he joins the Yankees and fills the role of 25th player.

Johnson, 36, was signed to a minor league contract today and played in an exhibition game at the team's facility in Tampa, Fla., leading off each inning. After he plays Saturday, the Yankees will decide whether to sign him to a relatively cheap major league deal -- and it seems as if they are leaning in that direction -- or release him.

''He wants to play with the Yankees,'' said Phil Tannenbaum, Johnson's agent. ''He wants to have the job, and I think this is a fabulous opportunity for him.''

His role with the Yankees would be extremely limited, in theory. The Yankees' outfield is already set, and Shane Spencer is going to get a chance to be the everyday designated hitter. Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, said that the acquisition of Johnson would have no effect on Spencer's playing time. ''He would be a pinch-runner off the bench,'' Cashman said.
