Two sections of stage seats had to be set up at Alice Tully Hall to accommodate the overflow for Thursday night's recital by Renee Fleming. In the last three years this American soprano has deservedly won an ardent following; she is now central to the artistic future of the Metropolitan Opera. But this means there may be few chances to hear her again in a hall so intimate, which will be unfortunate. Ms. Fleming used it to advantage in this remarkable recital.

There were many musical opportunities for Ms. Fleming to unleash the full resources of her voice, for example, the resplendent top notes that capped Strauss's ecstatic "Cacilie" and Turina's sultry Spanish "Besa el aura." Even during her winsome, elegantly restrained performance of Poulenc's "Fiancailles pour rire" songs, her voice had shimmering presence and warmth.

But on this night in this hall, it was the range and quality of her soft singing that were especially impressive. She captured the sense of quietude and calm at the core of Schubert's gentle "Du bist die Ruh." And the sustained, soft lines in his "Nacht und Traume" were rendered with affecting repose.

The only slight flaws in Ms. Fleming's singing were some occasional intonation problems, and these always seemed a result of attempts to create a particular nuance or shading. Ms. Fleming's artistry is deeply expressive without being mannered.
