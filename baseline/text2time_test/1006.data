MELAMED--Syma Krichefsky, on June 29 at age 90. The greatest! Predeceased by her husband, Lou, in 2005, she is survived by her children, Jill (Bernadette Flagler) and Fred (Leslee); Grandchildren, Lee and Alec; niece, Phyllis Sondes; Nephews, Ricky Kane, Benny Kane, Freddy Freifeld (Karen), Philip Freifeld (Helen); sister-in-law, Rhoda Kane; and many friends but three particularly special and dear ones: Rosie Tobias Shaw, Colette Mincu, and Jillieon Davids. She was also predeceased by her beloved siblings, Marty Kane and Sylvia Freifeld. The social and family nexus; the glue that held the glue together; a powerhouse, matriarch who will be tremendously missed.
