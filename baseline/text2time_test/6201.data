White House sources acknowledge that the reason for the President's decision to take away Mr. Kissinger's prized Security Council position had more to do with politics than with policy differences. As one put it, “I could give you a lot of reasons, but the best two are New Hampshire and Florida the first two Presidential primaries and our concern that Reagan will heat the President in both.”

Mr. Reagan, :1c‐cording io member of his staff, considers foreign policy a major issu in the campaign and has been particularly critical of Mr. e;i:singer's policy of the Soviet Union. Mr. Reagan and many others have argued that Mr. Kissinger's control of the National Security Council ‘and the State Department has !given him a virtual stranglehold over Presidential decisions in foreign affairs.

The changes come at a time when Mr. Kissinger has been awaiting the critical Soviet response to the latest American proposal on limitation of strategic arms in year‐long negotiations that both the Secretary and his critics see as central to the future of detente. It comes, according to the White House officials, after months of maneuvering by Mr. Rumsfeld to crack the Secretary's. power, arguing on numerous, occasions that “Henry is now a political liability to the President.”

Effect on Policy Seen

A State Department official who would not confirm the reports said: “Assuming it is true, it might start as a cosmetic way of protecting Henry and Ford from the baying wolves, but it could readily develop into a serious stagnation in our foreign policy.”

The White House officials. said that Mr. Ford broke the news to Mr. Kissinger early last week but refused to say exactly when.

In any event, Mr. Ford's de‐’ ciston to ask Mr. Kissinger to give up’ his second post, and Mr. Kissinger's apparent willingness to accede, represents a clear shift from their previous public positions on the matter.

Months ago, as pressure was building to reduce Mr. Kissin ger's responsibilities, Mr. Ford stated publicly that he would not do so because Mr. Kissinger's talents were unique and because he was receiving sufficient alternative advice on policy from other quarters. At the same time. Mr. Kissinger let it he known that he would regard such a request as a vote of no confidence in him and that he would feel compelled to resign from both positions if it were forthcoming.
