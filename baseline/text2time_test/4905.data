With Tony Jones leading the way, Purdue put a vise-like grip on the Big Ten race tonight.

Jones matched a season high with 23 points and nine assists as eighth-ranked Purdue remained the conference's only unbeaten team with a convincing 91-73 victory over fourth-ranked Michigan.

Jones hit 11 of 21 shots and Stephen Scheffler, who finished with 18, hit 7 of 8. Loren Clyburn, who scored 15 points, was perfect from the floor, from 3-point range and from the free-throw line.

It was Michigan's worst loss at Crisler Arena since dropping the 1985 home opener to Indiana, 87-62.

Purdue (16-2, 8-0) shot a torrid 70 percent, a Crisler Arena record, and extended its winning streak to nine games, matching the mark of the 1936 Boilermaker squad, which also won its first eight conference games. The previous arena-best was 68 percent by Michigan in a 1987 victory over Western Michigan. Michigan (15-4, 5-3) had its home-court victory streak snapped at 10 games.
