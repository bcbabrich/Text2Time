Like people, appliances have finite life spans. Although no one can predict precisely how long a refrigerator will last, standard-size refrigerators generally last 10 to 20 years, with an average life expectancy of 17 years. Knowing this, and the life spans of other big-ticket appliances, can help you budget more wisely and more accurately.
