Growing numbers of Vietnamese have been arriving in Hong Kong by boat in the past few months, crowding into refugee camps with thousands of other Vietnamese, most of whom have only a slim chance of finding new homes outside the chain-link fences of the bleak compounds.

So far this year, more than 1,500 Vietnamese refugees, most of them poor farmers and fishermen from north Vietnam, have landed in Hong Kong, four times the number of arrivals during the same period last year, according to Govennment figures.

Waves of refugees have been arriving in Thailand and Malaysia as well, and the Thai authorities have pushed some boats back out to sea.

Hong Kong has so far resisted such an extreme measure, but a recent newspaper survey revealed that 65 percent of those polled here want any new refugee boats turned away. And the Governor of this British colony, Sir David Wilson, said last week that Hong Kong is reconsidering its policy of allowing all boat people to land. 'Compassion Fatigue'
