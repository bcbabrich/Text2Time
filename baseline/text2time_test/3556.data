Chefs also take great pains to make their food easier to eat. If you go to a bistro, roasted chicken is likely to be served intact or cut into small pieces and arranged in a tight pile with the leg bone pointing upward. But at a finer restaurant, the bird is usually boned, and its breast meat is sliced. Thin slices of meat are more elegant and easier to cut. You can fan out slices on a plate and lean the legs against another part of the dish, say a mound of celery root puree.

It is important to think of how guests will eat the meat. You don't want to have to destroy a tower to get at a piece. Generally, unless you want a large piece of meat to be the feature of the plate, meats and fish should be cut down to make them more approachable.

One of the most basic principles is layering. This doesn't necessarily mean that ingredients should be stacked on top of one another like a napoleon. They can just overlap slightly, linking them implicitly.

This could be done with any dish. Typically rice, pasta or grains are used as the base, and the primary component, usually the meat, is laid on top. If there is a vegetable, it may lean on the meat or be tucked between the base and the meat. Sauce is spooned over specific parts of the dish and around the border.

The dishes at Union Pacific are great studies in layering: Rocco DiSpirito, the chef, has made a science of it. Components are layered directly on top of one another, and each has a distinct textural and flavor identity. In his mackerel salad, a thin circle of pear and celery puree is spooned into the center. It is the mortar for the bricks laid above it. A crunchy salad of celery root and pear fills the middle portion, then slices of charred mackerel, and a julienne of pear. It is crowned with a fluff of celery leaves and Asian greens. A celery oil vinaigrette dresses the salad layer and circles the tower.

It is a complex piece of architecture, not unconnected building blocks. Mr. DiSpirito constructs the dish this way so that with each forkful the diner gets the perfect proportion of each layer and the dish's flavors coalesce. It also looks impressive.

Layering can be used to make an ordinary dish look beautiful or to incorporate elements of surprise. The frisee aux lardons at Cafe Boulud does just that. When the dish arrives, all you see is a rough tangle of frisee, but each bite uncovers something new: a poached duck egg, cubes of sauteed foie gras, bacon and chicken livers and a dark sauce. The salad and meats could have been mixed together in a bowl and laid out on the plate, but this layered arrangement made the salad much more fun to eat.
