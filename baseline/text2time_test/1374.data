Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.

The first manned balloon flight took place in France during the early 1780s and, not surprisingly, people began thinking of how to turn the balloon into an implement of war. Within a few years, the French army was using observation balloons in battle, and Benjamin Franklin even suggested that balloons might actually be used to convey soldiers into the fray. In 1849 the Austrian high command sent some 200 unmanned balloons, laden with timed explosives, over Venice. Unfortunately, the wind shifted, carrying them back over the hapless Austrians.

Ballooning caught on in the United States as well, and by the beginning of the Civil War there were several budding “aeronauts,” as the balloonists styled themselves, anxious to place their crafts and skill at the disposal of the Federal forces, including an ambitious and highly capable young New Englander named Thaddeus Sobieski Constantine Lowe.

A self-educated former magician’s assistant, Lowe had relatively little experience with balloons when the war began, having only built his first craft in 1858. Three years later, he set out to make history by navigating the first manned transatlantic balloon flight. He lifted off in Cincinnati in late April 1861, and made it as far as South Carolina, where the vagaries of wind forced him down – smack in the heart of the newly minted Confederacy. Lowe was immediately arrested by surprised rebels, but they released him when they determined – falsely, as events would prove – that he posed no threat.

Lowe realized the value of what he’d seen from above of rebel troop preparations. Through political connections, he finessed a June 11 meeting with President Lincoln and offered the chief executive a demonstration. Six days later, Lincoln watched as Lowe, in the company of officials from the American Telegraph Company, soared to some 500 feet above Washington’s Columbia Armory in the hydrogen-filled balloon Enterprise. Lowe, ever the showman, had rigged the balloon with a telegraph key, and wired the president from aloft, “I have pleasure in sending you this first dispatch ever telegraphed from an aerial station …”

Lincoln, a lifelong fan of new technology and desperately seeking an advantage over the enemy, was sold. In a subsequent introductory letter to Winfield Scott, commander of the army, he wrote, “General, this is my friend Professor Lowe who is organizing an aeronautics corps and who is to be its chief. I wish you would facilitate his work in every way.” Lincoln authorized the creation of the Balloon Corps, which was staffed by civilians, and attached to the Army’s Corps of Topographical Engineers. Lowe was placed in charge at a salary of $10 a day. Lowe went to work on Aug. 2, 1861, eventually constructing seven hydrogen balloons of cord-wrapped and varnished silk cloth. He also designed and built portable hydrogen gas generators for service in the field, making his balloons highly mobile.

Lowe, however, was not the only man who wanted to be the Union’s chief aeronaut. One of the first orders for a military balloon went to an experienced Pennsylvania-born pilot, John Wise. For his first – and as it turned out, last – assignment, Wise was charged with observing the enemy at the Battle of First Bull Run. Unfortunately, his craft caught in tree branches en route to Manassas, rendering it useless. By this time, it was too late to contribute to the Union effort during the battle, but perhaps to show off his superior ballooning skills, Lowe went aloft after the fray, impressing the Union brass with his observations of the victorious rebels’ troop movements.

At Arlington on Sept. 24, Lowe ascended in the balloon Union to over 1,000 feet, marked enemy troop movements in Falls Church (some three miles away) and relayed the information to the ground by telegraph. The ensuing Union barrage represented the first time in military history that artillery had been accurately used against an unseen enemy. Lowe also devised a method of launching a balloon from the water, by rigging a “flight deck” on a converted coal barge – thus creating the world’s first aircraft carrier. He successfully used this system on rivers during the entire Peninsula Campaign. Reportedly, the Yankee aeronauts were so successful in marking rebel activities that some Confederate units banned campfires at night and created dummy camps to deceive the pilots.

Throughout the war, debate raged among aeronauts as to whether balloons should remain in a fixed position, or allowed to float on favorable winds. One of Lowe’s competitors, a brassy young New York State native named John La Mountain (or La Montain), floated his balloon directly over enemy positions near Ft. Monroe, Va., sketched what he saw and caught an air current back to the Union lines. Generally, however, balloons were kept tethered – or “captive” – when sent aloft, held earthbound by rows of straining soldiers.

The reasoning was simple: besides providing an irresistible target for enemy (and, in some cases, friendly) fire, an unattached balloon was at the mercy of the winds, and, as Lowe himself had found, wind currents were neither predictable nor fully understood at the time. The Confederates discovered this for themselves when they created a much-abridged version of Lowe’s Balloon Corps. Using multi-colored silk that, according to legend, had been designated for the manufacture of women’s attire, the rebels constructed two hot-air “silk dress balloons.” One escaped its tether, floated directly to the Yankees, and was captured. (The other was taken by the enemy as well, when the rebel tugboat that was towing it ran aground.)

While serving with the Topographical Engineers, the Balloon Corps was also invaluable in creating maps of the local terrain. The importance, and lack, of accurate maps during the Civil War cannot be exaggerated. When the war began, neither side had current or reliable information on the terrain – a problem that was neither easily nor speedily resolved. In 1862, Gen. George McClellan observed, “Correct local maps were not to be found, and the country, though known in its general features, we found to be inaccurately described in essential particulars….” Frequently, both armies relied almost exclusively on the intelligence gathered by scouts – and no terrestrial observer could come close to the intelligence available to the Balloon Corps.

Despite the Balloon Corps’ many contributions throughout numerous battles and campaigns, Army officers always viewed it with ambivalence. Despite the active support and encouragement of such highly placed generals as McClellan and Irvin McDowell, a large number of officers – often far from the front and unfamiliar with the workings of the Corps – tended to see the balloons as useless, and the pilots as a gaggle of unruly, overpaid civilians. The military didn’t know how best to use the crafts, or, for that matter, where to house them.

The Army transferred the balloons to the Army Corps of Engineers in early 1863 and placed a non-aeronaut, Capt. Cyrus B. Comstock, in charge. He had no use for Lowe or his creations, and wasted no time in cutting the Corps’ budget and drastically reducing Lowe’s salary. Lowe quit in disgust in May, and by early August, bereft of both adequate funding and Lowe’s inspired leadership, the Balloon Corps itself was no more.

The reappearance of observation balloons in American warfare would have to wait until World War I, during which the United States military created the Aeronaut Badge, to be worn by balloon pilots. The insignia, which would in time become known as the Balloon Pilot Badge, featured a winged balloon, across which were embossed the letters, “U.S.” Thaddeus Lowe would have been pleased.
