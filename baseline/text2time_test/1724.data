Location: East Lansing, Mich.

Nickname: Spartans.

2008 Countdown ranking: No. 29.

What I said in last year’s preview:

I’m not going so far as to say Michigan State will upend Ohio State, Wisconsin or Penn State for the Big Ten crown, but there is no doubt Dantonio has this program primed for an eight-win season. However, question marks exist at the receiver position and on the defensive line, two positions of strength for the Spartans a season ago. Over all, I predict an 8-4 finish for the Spartans, with losses coming at Cal to start the season and to Ohio State, Wisconsin and Penn State in Big Ten play. A one-win improvement would be a strong step forward from 2007, especially if the Spartans can make up two games (from 3-5 to 5-3) in conference. In addition, Michigan State hasn’t had back-to-back winning seasons since 1989-90.

Postseason re-ranking: No. 23.

2008 record and recap: (9-4, 6-2). A sterling season for Michigan State, one made even sweeter by the struggles of rival Michigan. The Spartans would actually have more wins at the end of September (four) than the Wolverines would post all season, and continued to ride a tough offense and opportunistic defense to nine wins, its most since 1999. Neither the offense nor the defense were especially dominating, though each played very well in spurts, but the Spartans did enough to keep itself in most games. Minus the regular season tussles with Penn State and Ohio State, the top teams in the Big Ten. If anything, those games showed that while the Spartans have made terrific strides in its two seasons under Mark Dantonio, the program still has some work to do before being considered a preseason favorite to win the conference. That’s truly the only negative I can find with this team. In order to build upon last year’s success, Michigan State must replace a handful of contributors, most notably at quarterback and running back.

High point: A 35-21 win over Michigan was certainly a highlight, especially when considering the Spartans hadn’t won at the Big House in 19 years. However, the best wins of the season came earlier that month, when M.S.U. beat Iowa (by 16-13) and Northwestern (by 37-20) in back-to-back weeks.

Low point: Michigan State played three ranked teams – Georgia, Penn State and Ohio State – and lost the three by an average of 27 points per game. The fourth loss was at California in the season opener (by 38-31), which while disappointing is far from a low point.

Tidbit: Michigan State has lost its last 12 games against Top 25 opposition. Nine of those 12 have come against Big Ten competition, with the other three losses coming to Georgia, Boston College and Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish were actually the last Top 25 team to lose to the Spartans, dropping a 44-41 overtime decision in September 2005.

Tidbit (scoring edition): Of the five teams to finish above .500 in the Big Ten a season ago, Michigan State was the only one to be outscored in conference play. The Spartans scored 201 points and allowed 208; however, to be fair, those numbers are quite skewed due to the blowout losses at the hands of Ohio State (by 45-7) and Penn State (by 45-18).

Top five N.F.L. players from Michigan State: Michigan State might not have the over all talent to rank among the top three, but I’m not sure if I’ve come many other programs with as much depth (Pittsburgh was one, if I remember correctly). For example, a quick taste of who missed the cut: quarterback Earl Morrall, linebackers Brad Van Pelt and George Webster, linemen Flozell Adams, Bubba Smith and Ray Wietecha, tight end Fred Arbanas and wide receivers Muhsin Muhammad and Derrick Mason. I chose Rison over the latter pair. Any complaints?

Team

Conference: Big Ten.

Head coach: Mark Dantonio (South Carolina ’79), 16-10 after two seasons with Michigan State. The former Spartans assistant (1995-2000) was hired to replace John L. Smith, whose four-year career in East Lansing ended with three straight losing seasons. Dantonio’s impact was immediate, both on the field and off; beyond merely returning the Spartans to bowl play, he instilled a sense of discipline and toughness that was highly lacking during Smith’s difficult tenure. With Michigan’s slide last fall, Dantonio and the Spartans were able to make up ground among in the historically one-sided rivalry. Dantonio became a candidate for a big-time job during his three-year stint as the coach at Cincinnati, where he finished with a record of 18-17, including 7-5 in 2006. The Bearcats were bowl eligible in two of those three seasons; in 2004, Dantonio became the first Bearcats coach in 23 years to finish with a winning record in his first season: 7-5, plus a victory over Marshall in the Forth Worth Bowl. Though Dantonio’s six years as a Michigan State assistant certainly played a large role in his early success as a head coach, it was during his time as an Ohio State assistant that he became a truly made his name in the coaching ranks. Dantonio served three seasons as the Buckeyes defensive coordinator under Jim Tressel, earning acclaim for his stingy defenses, most notably during a national title run in 2002. The Buckeyes went 32-6 during his three years as coordinator. His connection to Tressel dates back to Youngstown State, where Dantonio coached under him from 1986-90. What must be reassuring to Michigan State fans is that Dantonio doesn’t coach with smoke and mirrors: He preached to his team a more traditional philosophy – scrapping Smith’s spread attack – illustrating an overall recommitment to the style of play that propelled the program to five straight non-losing seasons from 1995-1999.

Returning starters: 15 (7 offense, 8 defense).

Key losses: Four starters must be replaced on offense, starting with the all-American running back Javon Ringer. He was the heart and soul of last season’s offense, rushing for 1,637 yards and a school-record 22 touchdowns. He finished with 390 carries, a massive total for an N.F.L. season (the league record is 416) but an unbelievable output in a 13-game college season. All told, Ringer’s senior totals accounted for a whopping 97 percent of Michigan State’s team rushing and 76 percent of its carries. If we remove sacks allowed from the equation (which count as a carry in college), Ringer made 390 of the team’s 485 carries – 80 percent. Few players meant more to their team than the Doak Walker Award finalist. Not to say Ringer was a one-year wonder: he rushed for 1,447 yards (on 245 carries) as a junior, and a combined 1,314 yards as a freshman and sophomore. The Spartans also lost a two-year starter in quarterback Brian Hoyer. Ringer’s play put the Michigan State passing game on the back burner, as Hoyer’s senior totals will attest: 2,404 yards on 51.0 percent passing with 9 touchdowns and 9 interceptions. Contrast that with Hoyer’s junior season, when he threw for 2,725 yards (completing 59.3 percent of his passes) with 20 touchdowns against 11 picks. Hoyer’s most impressive statistic was his 16 victories and two bowl appearances over his two seasons as the starter. The right side of the M.S.U. offensive line starters Roland Martin and Jesse Miller, each of whom earned second-team all-conference honors as seniors. This pair held down the right of the line for the last three seasons, with Miller starting the final 38 games of his career. Three starters do return on the M.S.U. front, but the role this pair played in leading Michigan State’s tough running game cannot be overstated.

The defensive line has some holes of its own to fill following the departure of tackle Justin Kershaw, a three-year starter, and end Brandon Long. Both were honorable mention all-Big Ten selections as seniors. Kershaw set new career-highs in tackles for loss (eight) and sacks (three) in his final season, while notching 28 tackles, the second-most of his career. He was often used at end in his sophomore season, when he made eight starts, but moved inside full-time as a junior and senior. Long did not break into the starting lineup until his senior season, but played well: 39 tackles (7 for loss) and 5.5 sacks. His tackle for loss total ranked fifth on the team and his sack total second. Ryan Allison’s game of musical chairs (position-wise) ended with him playing weakside linebacker, where he made 50 tackles as a senior. Allison began his career at receiver before moving to safety in 2007 and linebacker in 2008. He was a good fit at linebacker due to his speed, which allowed the Spartans to line him up in nickel packages. The biggest loss on the entire defense is strong safety Otis Wiley, a 2008 first-team all-conference pick and a three-year starter. As a senior, Wiley again led the Spartans with four interceptions, and added 78 tackles (third on the team). He played free safety from 2006-7 (honorable mention pick in 2006) before being moved to strong safety last fall, where he suffered no drop-off in productivity.

Players to watch: The Spartans will head into the season with an ongoing battle at quarterback, where the sophomores Kirk Cousins and Keith Nichol have laid claim to the starting role. I’ve been keeping my eye on Nichol for a few seasons now, ever since he spurned M.S.U. as a high school senior to enroll at Oklahoma. After losing out on the starting job with the Sooners to Sam Bradford, Nichol opted to transfer back to his home state, and after sitting out all of last season to N.C.A.A. regulations is eligible to play in 2009. When I read that Nichol was transferring to Michigan State I immediately penciled him in as the starter following his transfer season; however, after Cousins played well as the No. 2 in 2008, he may have the edge in the position battle. In backup duty, Cousins completed 32 of 43 passes (74 percent) for 310 yards and 2 touchdowns. Put up those kinds of numbers, and you move to the front of the pack. Whoever does earn the starting role, expect the reserve to earn plenty of snaps. If Cousins starts, Nichol’s running ability will make him a dangerous second option. Helping to ease the transition to a new starting quarterback is a deep receiver corps, which returns its top three targets from a season ago. The seniors Blair White led the Spartans with 43 receptions last fall, which went for 659 yards and a score. The sophomore B.J. Cunningham added 41 grabs for 528 yards, while the talented junior Mark Dell’s 679 receiving yards (on 41 receptions) paced the team. Dell got off to a hot start, grabbing 9 balls for 202 yards in the season opener against Cal, but hamstring injuries limited his effectiveness in the second half. Also in the mix at receiver are Keshawn Martin and Fred Smith, talented sophomores who will make an impact before the end of their careers. Michigan State returns an all-conference tight end in the senior Charlie Gantt, whose four touchdown grabs led the team. While the right side of the line – so important in the run game – must be replaced, the Spartans do return three starters up front: left tackle Rocco Cironi, left guard Joel Foreman and center Joel Nitchman. Each is capable of earning all-conference accolades. Holding down the two open spots heading into the fall are the sophomore Jared McGaha (guard) and the junior J’Michael Deane. A trio of freshmen (Chris McDonald, Hugh Stangeland and Zach Hunter) will push for playing time on the right side.

The Michigan State defense looks be in very good shape. The strength will be at linebacker, where the Spartans have a terrific pair of juniors in Greg Jones and Eric Gordon. Jones, who has led the Spartans in tackles in each of his two seasons, is one of the best linebackers in the Big Ten and a future all-American. As a sophomore, Jones tallied 127 stops (14 for loss, also a team-best) and 2 sacks, earning him first-team all-Big Ten accolades. He began the season on the strongside, where he started the first eight games, before moving to the middle for the final five. He’s projected to start in the middle this fall, with the senior Adam Decker serving as a key reserve. If that is the case, Gordon will go from the weakside to strong. Last fall, Gordon finished second on the team with 85 tackles (7.5 for loss) while adding 3 sacks. The senior Brandon Denson (31 tackles, 1.5 sacks) is the likely starter on the weakside. The line also looks solid, with returning starters Trevor Anderson and Owen Wilson joined by five other 2008 contributors. Anderson, an end, led the Spartans with eight sacks last fall, his first year with the program after transferring in from Cincinnati; he was an honorable mention all-conference pick. The junior Colin Neely is a contender to start opposite Anderson after making three starts last fall, though the sophomores David Rolf and Johnathan Strayhorn will also makes their case for the starting role. I am somewhat concerned with who will replace Kershaw: the sophomore Kevin Pickelman and the redshirt freshman Jerel Worthy are the leaders to start at tackle heading into the fall. Three more starters are back in the secondary. Cornerback is in good hands, as the senior Ross Weaver (28 career starts) and the junior Chris L. Rucker, a 2008 all-conference selection, return for another year in the starting lineup. Two other Spartans, the sophomore Johnny Adams and the senior Ashton Henderson, have made starts in the past and provide depth at cornerback. The situation at safety is a bit muddled. The senior Danny Fortener, who made nine starts at free safety last fall, will move to the strong spot to replace Wiley. He’ll battle the junior Marcus Hyde for the starting role. The senior Kendell Clark-Davis is back at free safety after struggling through injuries last fall (four starts), but may lose his starting role to the sophomore Trenton Robinson, who played well in the spring.

Position(s) to watch: Clearly, running back. However, a quick tidbit: Despite Ringer’s monster senior season, the Spartans still averaged only 130.2 yards rushing per game, the ninth-best total in the Big Ten. What does this mean? In my mind, that Michigan State will have a better rushing attack in 2009 – at least statistically. There is also no question that depth will be much improved. M.S.U. could go, given the potential of two incoming freshmen, six deep at running back, though odds are that the Spartans will feature a nice blend of three or four ball-carriers. The most experienced returning back is the senior A.J. Jimmerson, who has served as a reserve over the last two seasons, racking up 205 yards rushing. He’ll get plenty of snaps, as will the sophomore Andre Anderson. The team’s leading returning rusher from a season ago (97 yards), Anderson is likely the most well-rounded back on the roster. After getting his feet wet a season ago, I like Anderson’s chances to serve as the lead back in 2009. Fellow sophomore Ashton Legget, the only Spartan running back other than Ringer to score a touchdown last fall, is another option. Throw in the redshirt freshman Caulton Ray, and the Spartans went four-deep at the position during spring practice. Throw in the talented true freshmen Larry Caper and Edwin Baker, who arrive in the fall, and you have a talented – albeit inexperienced – corps of backs. My feeling is if Anderson can withstand the pounding, he’ll be the top guy. Still, I believe you’ll see a number of returning players earn carries, with Baker the most likely true freshman to break into the mix.

Nov. 7 Western Michigan

Nov. 14 @ Purdue

Nov. 21 Penn State

Game(s) to watch: No Ohio State, which is good. Early road games with Notre Dame, Wisconsin and Illinois – all three much improved – are not. There is absolutely no question that M.S.U. is good enough to again finish third in the Big Ten, but to do so, it cannot afford to lose more than two games in conference play.

Season breakdown & prediction: Here’s how I feel about Michigan State. The Spartans are going to be very good: I’m thinking eight wins and another meaningful bowl appearance. My only rationale for bumping M.S.U. down to fifth in the conference is my belief in Illinois, a team I have making a great improvement over its 2008 finish. I don’t think many can find qualms with Penn State and Ohio State at the top of the Big Ten, nor Iowa – which also lost a terrific running back – coming in third. No slight is meant against the Spartans, with whom I have few concerns. Offensively, I feel the pair of youngsters will at least match Hoyer’s 2008 output, and while no one of the corps of young backs will put up Ringer’s numbers, the group as a whole should improve on the team’s rushing total from a season ago. The defense will continue to grow, and remains young enough to even see improvement on a week-to-week basis. I really like the Spartans: I admire the process by which Dantonio has rebuilt the program, and respect how rapidly the team has closed the gap on rival Michigan (though the Wolverines have helped speed up this process). A somewhat tougher schedule (in my mind, even without O.S.U.) may cost the Spartans one regular season victory, but I don’t have this team losing more than four games heading into bowl play. Last fall’s finish gave M.S.U. back-to-back winning seasons for the first time since 1989-90; if the Spartans match last season’s win total (of which it is more than capable), the team would have nine wins in back-to-back years for the first time since 1965-66.

Dream season: A 10-2 finish, 7-1 in the Big Ten, ties the Spartans with Ohio State for the Big Ten lead.

Nightmare season: Michigan State’s struggles in the backfield lead to some offensive ineffectiveness, landing the team a 6-6 regular season record.
