The New Jersey Legislature worked into the morning today in an effort to adopt the largest budget in the state's history and close its largest projected deficit ever.

Early today, the extraordinary session that began Sunday afternoon dissolved in bitter fighting among the Democrats over the proposed sports arena in Newark. The State Senate's vote on the corporate business tax, the centerpiece of Gov. James E. McGreevey's budget proposal, was suspended to give Senate leaders and the governor time to placate Democrats who had defected in an effort to force a hearing on the arena bill.

The fighting behind closed doors led to threats and even shoving, according to one Republican senator. And after submitting enough votes to assure that the corporate business tax bill would pass, most Republicans went home.

The $23.4 billion budget, which follows Governor McGreevey's blueprint, would restructure the corporate income tax, borrow against revenue expected from the state's share of the national tobacco settlement, nearly double the cigarette tax to $1.50 a pack and raise an array of fees.
