Ms. Stewart makes an easy target, having held out an ideal of butter-churn perfection in these microwave times. (''I really want people to get out their sewing machines again,'' she once opined. ''I know we don't have time, but just thinking about it is a step in the right direction.'') Notions like these border so closely on satire that a parody of her magazine, Martha Stewart Living, showed how homeless people could garden in grocery carts and take advantage of shifting sunlight. Mr. Oppenheimer, whose last book was an equally uncharitable look at Ethel Kennedy, goes further by also sniping at Ms. Stewart for the kind of ambition and tenacity that might be lauded in a biography of Bill Gates.

Naturally, her ego, the writer's cruelty and our own complicity (as the mulch in which Ms. Stewart's empire grew) have sent this unauthorized biography flying out of stores. And there's not a beach in America where such a colorful feat of character assassination won't be met by at least surreptitious interest. For if Mr. Oppenheimer has done dirty work, he has done his homework too. He presents Ms. Stewart as a tireless, unscrupulous self-promoter who, in creating the corporate omelet that is now Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, has broken many an egg.

Little fibs come back to haunt her throughout this account, even in her description of her first apartment with Andy Stewart, her husband and later the publisher of her phenomenally successful illustrated books. She wrote of how three pale-blue pet birds fluttered charmingly throughout the love nest, perching on her pencil, while Mr. Oppenheimer notes that the place was bleak and the birds died grim deaths. (Ms. Stewart herself described the place as ''three miserable rooms overlooking the rooftops of 114th Street'' in a 1987 USA Today article.)

When the Stewarts began commuting to a weekend house and creating the country-squire fantasy that would prove so lucrative, this too involved more stress than romance. ''She would say to Andy 'Go dig a well or a cesspool,' '' an on-the-record source says.'' Another presumable ex-friend recalls the Stewarts' fastidiously oiling their wood-burning stove.

Moving from recreational housekeeping (and a career as a stockbroker) into professional catering, Ms. Stewart developed the new hobby of assuming credit for her collaborators' work. While supplying prepared food to a Westport, Conn., shop, she was described as the place's proprietor in a newspaper article. The owners, who then dismissed her, say she showed up armed with a dictionary and tried to insist that proprietor was another way of saying manager. Later, after she hired Elizabeth Hawes to write her first book, ''Entertaining,'' she allowed the author's credit to read: ''By Martha Stewart, text with Elizabeth Hawes.'' Ms. Hawes didn't get a ''text by'' credit and didn't get invited to the Westport publication party.
