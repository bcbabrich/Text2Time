After a big Memorial Day weekend brought a strong end to a record-breaking season, Broadway’s box office sales sagged a bit last week.

The post-holiday comedown — not unexpected given that fewer tourists were in town — meant that most of the shows vying for Tony Awards saw a drop in grosses. The Tonys will be presented on Sunday.

There were still 10 shows that grossed more than $1 million in the week that ended May 31, including the hit plays “Fish in the Dark” and “The Audience”; the new musicals “An American in Paris,” “Something Rotten!”, “The King and I” and “Finding Neverland”; and four longer-running hits, “The Lion King,” “Wicked,” “Aladdin” and “The Book of Mormon.”

But several shows that had topped $1 million the previous week dropped below that mark last week, including “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical,” “Kinky Boots” and “The Phantom of the Opera.”

Among the contenders for the best new musical Tony, three had news to brag about: “American in Paris” continues to pull in the biggest box office, “Something Rotten!” saw the biggest increase in grosses, and “Fun Home” had the most packed houses. That show bested even “The Book of Mormon” by reporting 103 percent capacity audiences, meaning that not only was every seat taken but there were substantial standing-room attendees as well.

The fourth nominee, “The Visit,” continues to lag at the box office, taking in $149,023, which is only 20 percent of its potential.

The first show to open in the new Broadway season, the comedy “An Act of God,” written by David Javerbaum and starring Jim Parsons, reported a healthy $693,379 gross in four previews and four regular performances. That was down from the previous week, reflecting the fact that the show gave away tickets on opening night and to critics.
