With 10 nods for his comeback album, “Recovery,” Eminem led the nominations for the 53rd annual Grammy Awards, which were announced on Wednesday night in a televised ceremony from Los Angeles.

Jay-Z, Lady Gaga, Lady Antebellum and Bruno Mars also racked up plenty of nominations: Jay-Z, Lady Gaga and the country band Lady Antebellum had six apiece, and Mr. Mars, who has sung on his own hits and those of others, had seven, including several for collaborations.

In the album of the year category, Eminem’s “Recovery” is up against Lady Antebellum’s “Need You Now,” “The Suburbs” by Arcade Fire,” Lady Gaga’s mini-album “The Fame Monster” and the likely wild card, Katy Perry’s “Teenage Dream.” The competition for best new artist pits Justin Bieber against Drake — both major young hitmakers — along with the jazz bassist and singer Esperanza Spalding and two British bands, Florence and the Machine and Mumford & Sons.

For years the nominations were usually announced in a drab early-morning press conference. But for a third time the Recording Academy, which bestows the awards, put together an hourlong show on CBS to prepare audiences for the awards, which will be presented in Los Angeles on Feb. 13.

Like the recent awards ceremonies, the nominations show, hosted by LL Cool J, was packed with performances. Ms. Perry opened it performing her “California Gurls” in a short silvery dress with a Christmas-ornament-theme headpiece. Miranda Lambert, Mr. Mars and the band Train and others played.

The television format provided some perhaps unintended comedy. Stevie Wonder seemed surprised by a script that named him as a previous winner of album of the year. And in announcing the nominees for song of the year (a songwriters’ prize), Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters and the teen-pop singer Selena Gomez grimaced when mentioning “the song otherwise known as ‘Forget You’ by Cee Lo Green,” as Ms. Gomez said. (The title of the song — on which Mr. Green shares songwriting credit with Philip Lawrence and Mr. Mars — contains a blunt profanity.)

Also up for song of the year are Eminem’s “Love the Way You Lie,” featuring Rihanna (written by Eminem, Alexander Grant and Holly Hafferman); “Need You Now,” written by Lady Antebellum and Josh Kear; Ray LaMontagne’s “Beg Steal or Borrow”; and Tom Douglas and Allen Shamblin for Ms. Lambert’s song “The House That Built Me.” The nominees for record of the year (which recognizes a track’s performers), are Mr. Green’s song; Eminem’s “Love the Way You Lie”; B.o.B’s “Nothin’ on You,” featuring Mr. Mars; Jay-Z and Alicia Keys’s “Empire State of Mind”; and Lady Antebellum’s “Need You Now.”

Among those with multiple nods are Jeff Beck, B.o.B and John Legend, with five apiece, and Mr. Green, Drake, Rihanna, Ms. Perry, Alex da Kid, the Black Keys, Ari Levine, the Roots, Dirk Sobotka and Zac Brown, with four.

The Grammys are voted on by about 12,000 members of the Recording Academy, who must have credits on at least six commercially released tracks to qualify. An irregularity in the scheduling of the 2010 Grammy ceremony resulted in an unusual 13-month eligibility period this year, from Sept. 1, 2009, to Sept. 30, 2010.
