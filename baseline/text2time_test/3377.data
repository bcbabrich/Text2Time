''This building was all steam-powered cooling when it was built in the late 1950's and the electrical cooling was added later,'' said William K. Stoddard, assistant vice president for engineering at the Rockefeller Group. ''With deregulation, we had an incentive to go to three fuels,'' said James Haviaris, the building's manager.

He said the plan was to use the gas-powered equipment for the base cooling load and then start up either the steam or electric equipment to meet additional demand depending on the cost of each source of energy.

In general, he said managers expected the cost of steam to be lower in the summer, when there is less demand for heat, while the cost of electricity is expected to soar in warmer months due to demand for air-conditioning. In the winter months, the price of energy is expected to be less of an issue because building managers can do direct heat exchanges with outside air when temperatures go below 55 degrees.

Rockefeller Group executives said they were trying to look forward to the needs of their tenants in the future as well as deal with the vagaries of deregulation as they redesigned the cooling system. Although the building is not getting any bigger, its cooling needs are growing as tenants add more computers and other heat-generating equipment.

The building's signature tenant, Time-Life, has a large photographic processing operation in the building to supply its portfolio of magazines, which places additional demand on the cooling system. ''We knew the needs of our tenants were growing, and we wanted a system that could support them for the next 15 to 20 years,'' Mr. Stoddard said.
