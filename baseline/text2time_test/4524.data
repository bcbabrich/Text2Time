The Federal Government's top highway official proposed today that private businesses operate portions of the 42,500-mile Interstate System, charging tolls and providing money to repair decaying highways and bridges.

"We believe we have got to get the private sector involved in financing highway improvements that are necessary," said the official, Rodney E. Slater, administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, in his first meeting with reporters since President Clinton appointed him in June.

The proposal, not yet a specific plan, has the support of Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena, according to a spokesman, who added that the Secretary generally backed public-private partnerships in transportation.

The Reagan and Bush administrations had similar goals. Critics raised concerns that such policies could lead to profiteering at the public's expense, and asked why the Government could not provide services as efficiently as private industry. Total Cost Put at $290 Billion
