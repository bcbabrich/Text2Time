Even in a genre noted for youthful prodigies, Samuel R. Delany stands out. His first novel was published in 1962, when he was 20 years old. The next three years saw the appearance of a wildly ambitious trilogy now known as "The Fall of the Towers"; before the end of the decade, five more novels (among them "The Einstein Intersection," which won a Nebula Award) and some innovative short stories, including the Nebula-winning "Aye, and Gomorrah," had secured Mr. Delany's reputation as one of science fiction's most important writers.

Although he has reined in the rhetorical excesses of his early years, he has never ceased to experiment with form and content. His subjects have included love and sex in their many guises and the central role of language in the human comedy. He has written a stylistically and thematically challenging novel that reached a wide audience ("Dhalgren"), autobiography so frank it verges on pornography, and some of science fiction's most thoughtful criticism.

His latest novel, THEY FLY AT CIRON (Tor/ Tom Doherty, $19.95), serves as a kind of retrospective for Mr. Delany. While the writing displays the spare beauty of his mature style, the setting and characters derive from a short story he wrote in 1962 but failed to sell. Even as his career flourished he could not get this story out of his mind; a second version, reworked in collaboration with his friend James Sallis, appeared under a joint byline in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in 1971. Still unsatisfied, Mr. Delany kept tinkering. The version he offers now contains none of Mr. Sallis's contributions. Instead it represents a fruitful collaboration between the mature Mr. Delany and his younger self of 30 years ago.

A biting parable about the bloody roots of civilization, "They Fly at Ciron" takes place on an unnamed world that except for a few disconcerting details could be Earth before the beginning of recorded history. For those who believe that small is beautiful and growth is optional, Ciron itself might be utopia -- one of a chain of independent villages and hamlets, each linked to its neighbors by occasional travelers and trade but basically self-sufficient. Then one day the forces of Myetra arrive. Myetra is an empire in embryo, a technologically advanced state whose leaders believe they are bringing the boon of civilization to those who survive their conquests.
