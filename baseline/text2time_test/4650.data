By the (good or bad?) luck of the Olympic blind draw, heavyweight Danell Nicholson and superheavyweight Larry Donald of the United States team advanced today to quarterfinal showdowns with two of Cuba's best boxers that may well determine the gold medalist in each division.

Nicholson, a smooth 6-foot-3-inch, 201-pound slugger from Chicago, will oppose Felix Savon, who has dominated amateur boxing for nine years, on Monday after having outpointed Zeljko Mavrovic of Croatia, 9-6.

Donald, will go against Roberto Balado, the reigning two-time world amateur champion, after having stopped a bloodied Nikolai Koulpine of the Unified Team in two rounds at the Pavello Club Joventut.

"I believe our bout will be for the gold medal, most definitely," Donald said of his three-round match with Balado on Tuesday. "It's a shame one of us has to lose; hopefully, it won't be me."
