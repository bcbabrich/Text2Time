Jaime Benítez Rexach, a former chancellor and president of the University of Puerto Rico who from 1972 to 1976 was the island's nonvoting representative in Congress, died on Wednesday in a hospital in San Juan. He was 92.

Under Mr. Benítez, who became chancellor in 1942, the University of Puerto Rico increased significantly in size and quality, becoming one of the finest institutions of higher education in the Spanish-speaking world.

An overhaul of the university's statutes in the year Mr. Benítez took over laid the basis for the changes by sharply reducing political interference in university affairs.

The student body grew from about 5,000 to more than 40,000 by the time Mr. Benítez stepped down. The schools of medicine, dentistry and architecture were added and regional campuses established.
