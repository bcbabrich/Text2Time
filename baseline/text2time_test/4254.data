ROBERTO ALOMAR does not need surgery to fix a broken right leg, and might be ready for the start of spring training, Toronto Blue Jays officials said yesterday.

Alomar broke his fibula, the thin bone between the knee and the ankle, during a winter league baseball game in Puerto Rico on Wednesday. He will be re-examined by team doctors on Monday to be sure the fracture does not still require an operation. With no surgery, the All-Star second baseman should be ready to start the 1994 season with the rest of the Blue Jays in late February.

Dr. ALLAN GROSS, Toronto's orthopedic specialist, placed Alomar's right leg in a nonweight-bearing cast after X-rays, said HOWARD STARKMAN, the team's director of public relations. If the fracture worsens and surgery is required, Alomar could miss all five weeks of spring training.

Alomar, 25, broke his leg sliding into second base while trying to stretch a single into a double during a game in Ponce, P.R. Alomar and his brother, SANDY JR., were playing on a team managed by their father, SANDY SR., in their hometown. (AP)
