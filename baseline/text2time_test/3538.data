Ernst Einstein, a founding partner in Einstein Moomjy Inc., the carpet-store chain, died Wednesday in a hospital in Summit, N.J. He was 76.

Mr. Einstein died of cancer and had Parkinson's disease, according to his son Gilles.

Mr. Einstein and his twin brother, Ted, were born on Aug. 22, 1923, in Frankfurt, Germany, the children of Julius Einstein, a carpet merchant, and his wife, Rita.

As refugees from the Nazi regime, they settled in France with their parents before World War II.

After the Nazis invaded France, the family became separated and the boys, by then teen-agers, worked on farms in the south of France.

Ted Einstein came to the United States in 1947 at the age of 24 and established a carpet business; he was joined by Ernst in 1955.
