MANY major league baseball players have bats and gloves with their signatures on them, so it figures a race car driver would choose a car when selling something with his signature.

Rick Mears, a three-time Indianapolis 500 winner, and Larry Shinoda have collaborated on the Rick Mears-edition Corvette ZR-1. The car, a copy of which is on display at the New York Automobile Show this week at the Jacob Javits Center in Manhattan, is basically a Corvette with more aerodynamic body work.

The Mears Corvette will be available through a yet-to-be-established dealer network for about $53,500. As reward for winning the 1988 Indy 500, Chevrolet gave Mears the first ZR-1 ever made. If Mears does sell the valuable automotive collector's item, the buyer need not worry about hard mileage. Mears said the car is on blocks and he doesn't do much hot-rodding at home in Bakersfield, Calif.

"The car I drive mostly," he said, "is a Chevrolet truck." But don't call him Grandpa Mears just because he could use a good-driver deduction on his insurance premium. His other cars are a turbocharged Porsche, an Acura NSX and another Corvette -- not the stuff multiple-car discounts are made of.
