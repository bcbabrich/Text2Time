Larry Weinberg, the majority owner of the Portland Trail Blazers, said yesterday that the club would be sold to Paul Allen, a Seattle businessman. Weinberg said that Allen, 35 years old, would be sole owner and would be ''committed to keeping the franchise in this area.'' Details of the sale were not disclosed. Weinberg said he expected the National Basketball Association to approve the deal within two to three weeks. Weinberg, 62, a Los Angeles resident, became majority owner and president of the team in 1975.(AP)
