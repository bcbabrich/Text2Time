It is impossible to assure the future of the area, General de Gaulle said, without the participation of the Government in Peking, which France recognized on Monday because, he said, the French see "the world as it is.”

President de Gaulle's proposal came at the end of a rambling 92‐minute news conference in the Elysee Palace. His audience totaled 1,000, including French Cabinet ministers and reporters.

The general, who is 73 years old, seemed older and more tired as he took his seat beneath glaring lights. He hardly glanced at the Cabinet, which sat at his right. Although his sentences were as rounded as ever, his choice of words as precise, some of the old vigor appeared to be missing.

The impression that he had aged rapidly in the last six months was linked by many to his refusal, good‐natured but definite, to say whether he would be a candidate for reelection.

The news conference in the Salle des Fetes began with a weighty discourse on the advantages of the French Constitution, which will be six years old next October. He took a poor view of the 175year‐old American constitutional system.
