The bookstore clerk seen dusting off copies of a new nonfiction book about a mass murderer in "Ambition," which opened yesterday at the Sutton and other theaters, happens to be the mass murderer himself. It is this film's scary premise that an over-eager writer who has been unable to sell his own memoir might improve his fortunes by laying claim to a real killer as a subject -- and then goading the killer into renewed violent activity, just for the sake of a more salable story.

Lou Diamond Phillips, who wrote the offbeat but sometimes overly mild screenplay, stars in "Ambition" (which was directed by Scott D. Goldstein) as a bookstore manager and aspiring author named Mitchell Osgood, who is a strenuously assimilated Filipino-American. Frustrated over his own stalled career, Mitchell decides to manipulate the fragile pysche of Albert Merrick (Clancy Brown), who has been released from prison after what looks like a remarkably short stay, in view of his widely publicized murderous rampage through a crowded nightclub.

In any case, Mitchell quickly befriends Albert and offers him a job, which proves to be a good way of keeping Albert under surveillance. Mitchell does this despite the warnings of Albert's parole officer (Richard Bradford), who says, "Tell me something, Mr. Osgood: Do you think it'd be ethical for me to lead you to Merrick so you can mess around with his head?"

Mitchell apparently does. And he has so many thoughts of his own on this subject that he tampers with Albert's medication, arranges a traumatic reunion between Albert and his mother (Grace Zabriskie), and tries to interest Albert in Mitchell's father (Haing S. Ngor), who is very ill and has begun to get on Mitchell's nerves.
