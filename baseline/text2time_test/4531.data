Protest then, protest now . . . KATE PIERSON, a vocalist with the B-52's, the campy rock group, and seven other members of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an animal-rights organization, were arrested yesterday in the offices of Vogue magazine, where they were marching with bullhorns and pasting antifur slogans on the walls.

They were taken to the Midtown South police precinct and charged with criminal mischief and criminal trespass, which can carry a penalty of a year in prison and a fine.

"Just last week, Vogue rejected a PETA paid antifur advertisement and now we see in the October issue a spread of several pages called "Fur, the Fabric that Empowers,' " said DAN MATHEWS, director of international campaigns for the organization. "We wanted to meet with Anna Wintour or her fashion or news editor and we were completely blocked, so we decided to sit in."

To which PAUL WILMOT, director of public relations and communications for Vogue, responded: "If they want a meeting with us, this is a charming way to set the tone." NADINE BROZAN
