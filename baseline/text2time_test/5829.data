Two leaking water mains in separate areas of Manhattan forced the closing of icy streets early yesterday and left hundreds of people temporarily without water.

The incidents, the sixth and seventh of the week, were caused by ''weird weather,'' according to Martha Holstein, a spokesman for the city's Department of Environmental Protection.

Miss Holstein said that the recent rapid shifts between warm and cold weather had made the pipes more prone to breaking.

At 3:30 A.M., water was reported to be leaking from a main in front of 59 Walker Street, between Broadway and Church Street, a mostly commercial and loft area. The water from the 12- inch main created a hole in the cobblestone street that trapped an automobile. The street was closed into the afternoon as workers salted and sanded the area.
