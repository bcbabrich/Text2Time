FOR lunch one day in Priorat, I was served chicken with prunes, and with it I drank, of course, a Priorat red. It may seem that a wine with the heft of a Priorat would overpower the mildness of chicken. But, in fact, it struck the perfect balance.

The cook had used the leg and thigh of the chicken, rather than the breast, and braised them with wine and soft, plump prunes. The leg and thigh have darker meat and more flavor, which stood up to the wine. The prunes underlined the fruit in the wine, and the wine in the recipe -- yes, white! -- cut the richness of the dish. There is no rule against using white wine in a dish that you pair with reds.

Potent wines like Priorats demand ample dishes that can withstand their power. Aside from this recipe, roasted lamb is a natural. AMANDA HESSER
