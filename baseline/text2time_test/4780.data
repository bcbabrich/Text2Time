George Speri Sperti, a research scientist who invented a wide range of products, including a sunlamp and the patent medicines Preparation H and Aspercreme, died Monday at St. Elizabeth Medical Center North in Cincinnati. He was 91 years old.

Mr. Sperti, who lived in Burlington, Ky., had suffered several strokes and probably died of an abdominal aneurysm, a spokesman for the family said.

Mr. Sperti, who developed Aspercreme for arthritis relief and Preparation H, the hemorrhoid treatment, held more than 120 patents. He also devised methods to enhance Vitamin D in milk and to freeze-dry orange juice concentrate.

Mr. Sperti studied electrical engineering at the University of Cincinnati and got his start as an inventor while in college. Using materials from his mother's kitchen and part of a hacksaw blade, he fashioned a device to measure the consumption of electricity by large industrial users. He sold the invention to the Westinghouse Electric Corporation for $30,000. Profits Donated to Research
