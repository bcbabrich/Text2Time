When describing events not recorded by cameras, television news reports often use artists' sketches, a technique that Miss Rossen discarded because ''it is boring and confusing. We opted to try something new.'' The 1988 Olympics

The 1988 Summer Olympic Games in Seoul, South Korea, may seem remote, but not to executives at the three television networks, who are already maneuvering for position in next year's negotiations for the rights to televise the games here. This week NBC-TV and its parent corporation, RCA, have a delegation of more than a dozen top officials in Seoul to meet with Korean broadcasters and members of that country's Olympic organizing committee.

''The bidding for television rights is not beginning,'' said Robert Mulholland, president of NBC, who is heading the delegation, ''But this is the beginning of the process that will ultimately culminate in the bidding.'' Both ABC-TV and CBS-TV have begun informal discussions as well. Elton Rule, president of ABC, visited Korean broadcasters early in the summer, and in July Roone Arledge, president of ABC News and Sports, met with members of the Korean organizing committee in London. CBS also recently sent several officials to visit Seoul.

The delegation from NBC is by far the largest. It contains Richard Holbrooke, formerly an assistant secretary of state in the Carter Administration, who has been hired by NBC as a consultant. ''He is an expert in Asia,'' Mr. Mulholland explained.

Officials at all three networks expect the television rights to be awarded by the Korean committee next year, and they anticipate that the price tag will be at least double the $225 million paid by ABC for the 1984 games in Los Angeles. Despite the high costs, the networks are as eager as ever for the revenues that Olympics coverage generates. ABC plans to sell more than $650 million in advertising for the 1984 games. News Controversy

Two months ago NBC News expanded a newscast that television viewers never see. Called the ''A'' news, it is a package of international and national news reports that the network sells to more than 150 of its affiliated stations. However, its expansion - including more time, a bigger budget and an increased staff - has raised the ire of one of NBC's ''Nightly News'' two anchors, Roger Mudd, who sees it as a direct competitor to his own program, which is currently third in the audience ratings, after ABC and CBS.
