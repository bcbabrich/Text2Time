The Pentagon is seeking civilian advice on how to use new tests that screen blood for exposure to acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, officials said today.

The request is raising concern among some homosexual rights organizations that say the armed services might use the test to try to identify homosexuals and remove them from military service.

But the Pentagon's health affairs office, which requested the evaluation, said today that it was not considering any proposal to screen all recruits or all those in the services. David Newhall 3d, principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, said the evaluation of the tests was ''absolutely not'' intended as a device to identify homosexuals in the service.

Defense Department policy declares, ''Homosexuality is incompatible with military service.'' Thus, individuals can be discharged for homosexual activity or for an admission of homosexuality.
