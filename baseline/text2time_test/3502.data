Connecticut authorities have suspended the license of a youth camp in East Haddam after substantiating five instances of what they are calling the neglect or abuse of campers, who are mentally retarded or have other special needs.

Officials of the Connecticut Department of Public Health, which regulates youth camps, began calling parents and guardians of the 79 campers on Friday, and by last night all but one of the campers had been picked up, said William C. Gerrish, a spokesman for the department.

The camp, Shadybrook Camp and Learning Center, was providing 24-hour care for the campers, who came from at least 10 states.

A suspension order for the camp was issued Friday, and it requires the camp to close by Tuesday. A hearing on the charges is scheduled for Aug. 18 at the Department of Public Health.
