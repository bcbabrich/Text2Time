Paul Ramirez Jonas Postmasters Gallery 80 Greene Street, near Spring Street SoHo Through March 9

This is an intriguing but not completely convincing second show from Paul Ramirez Jonas, a promising artist who is deeply intrigued by science and the history of invention.

A life-size drawing of the propeller of the S. S. Maine is contrasted with a small model (in a bottle) of the ship, whose unexplained sinking accelerated the Spanish-American War -- a discrepancy that pulls the viewer back and forth between feeling gigantic and dwarfed.

Also on view are 10 tiny weather vanes cut from tin in 19th-century American motifs. Their forms spin madly, either due to large balloons blowing air on them or, more mysteriously, lights shining on them from just outside the vaccum-sealed glass bottles in which they are sealed.

Mr. Ramirez Jonas continues to have a wonderful way with materials, scale, moving parts and Americana, but his kineticism has lost some of its earlier colorfulness and poetry. ROBERTA SMITH
