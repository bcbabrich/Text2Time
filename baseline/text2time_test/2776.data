Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes – 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Consider the future of space travel and exploration.

2. Learn about the orbital space plane, NASA’s proposed spacecraft of the future, by reading and discussing the article “NASA Goes Shopping for a Shuttle Successor, Off the Rack.”

3. Work in groups to plan future space missions for orbital space planes.

4. Individually design orbital space planes created to carry out their group’s mission; compare designs and create a final plane design; present missions and plane designs to the class.

Resources / Materials:

-pens/pencils

-paper

-student journals

-classroom board

-copies of the article “NASA Goes Shopping for a Shuttle Successor, Off the Rack” (one per student)

-computers with Internet access

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Student respond to the following prompt in their journals (written on the board prior to class): “Imagine the future of space travel. How do you think space exploration might change or develop over the next twenty years? Do you think possibilities such as space tourism or lunar land development are realistic visions? Why or why not?” Allow students a few minutes to share their responses. As a class, discuss the many ways that space travel has developed since NASA’s inception over 40 years ago. What are some of the vehicles that have been developed for space missions? How have the vehicles for human missions evolved over time?

2. As a class, read and discuss the article “NASA Goes Shopping for a Shuttle Successor, Off the Rack,” using the following questions:

a. What is a space plane, according to the article?

b. What is the purpose of an orbital space plane?

c. Why are some people critical of the orbital space plane?

d. What is the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee of the House Science Committee?

e. How much money has been spent on the space plan program thus far, according to the article?

f. How much more does NASA plan to spend through 2007 for developing the plane?

g. To what does the expression “KISS” refer, and how does it relate to the space program, according to the article?

h. Which aerospace companies are competing to design the craft?

i. How much has each company been paid to create designs, according to the article?

j. What does NASA expect the space plane to look like?

3. Divide students into small groups. Explain that each group’s assignment is to plan a space mission to take place twenty years from now and then to design an orbital space plane to carry out the mission. Each group should first visit NASA’s Web site for kids, which contains detailed information on the orbital space plane, “Orbital Space Plane-Commuting to Space” (//kids.msfc.nasa.gov/news/2003/news-OSP.asp). Alternately, if computers are not available, the Web page can be printed out for students to read.

After reading more about the plane, each group will be responsible for planning its mission, to take place twenty years from now. Mission plans must include the following information (written on the board for easier student access):

–Destination of the mission

–Purpose of the mission

–Length of time the mission will take

–People who will take part in the mission (number of pilots/participants and their roles)

–How the mission will help advance our understanding of space

–Realistic funding necessary for the development and execution of this mission (extra credit)

Each group should initially jot down their responses to these different areas of their mission plan and then develop a more formal written plan that incorporates their ideas. Plans should not exceed three typed pages.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: After groups have completed their mission plans, each member of the group will design an orbital space plane to carry out the mission. The plane designs should meet the following criteria (written on the board for students to copy prior to leaving class):

–Must clearly demonstrate how the craft will accommodate the number of people designated for the mission

–Must show where equipment and supplies will be stored on the plane (with an accompanying list of these supplies)

–Must contain technology for communicating with Earth

–Must offer at least one special feature that will assist in the plane’s mission

In a later class, groups should reconvene to share and compare their designs. Each group should then create a final space plane design by combining and modifying members’ plans and present their missions to the class.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–If you were on the House Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee, do you think you would support more funding for the orbital space plane? Why or why not?

–Do you think they orbital space plane should be NASA’s focus for the future? Why or why not? If not, what types of crafts do you think would best suit the program’s future goals?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on initial journal responses, participation in class and small group discussions, thoughtful group mission plans, individual space plane designs, and final group mission and plane design presentation.

Vocabulary:

orbital, complement, disintegrated, subcommittee, aerospace

Extension Activities:

1. Create a “How It Works” poster to illustrate how one of the currently employed space crafts works. What technology did it replace? How was it different? What is it able to do that previous crafts could not? What are its limitations? See the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum Web site for research help (//www.nasm.si.edu/galleries/gal114/SpaceRace/sec500/sec542.htm).

2. Research and create an illustrated timeline or children’s book of space exploration from its conception to today. What were some the famous crafts and their missions? Who are some of the astronauts associated with the missions, and why are they well-known?

3. If space tourism ever became a reality, how do you think a typical “tour” would work? Design a travel brochure for a vacation in outer space.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Economics- Debate whether money should be used for development of the orbital space plane as the next generation of space shuttle. Consider the fact that the United States government has a fixed budget, and money used for certain programs means that money will not be available for other programs. Split the class into two opposing sides: pro-governmental funding of the space airplane and anti-governmental funding of the space airplane. To prepare for your debate, research the space airplane proposal to back up your argument with figures. You may also wish to visit the NASA Web site (//www.nasa.gov) and look for press releases and other documents from the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee of the House Science Committee (//www.house.gov/science).

Language Arts- On airplanes, there is a standard set of rules, instructions and demonstrations that flight attendants are required to explain to passengers. Write a similar script for a flight attendant to explain to those aboard an orbital space plane. Be sure to include details such as how to locate emergency equipment and exits, a description of safety features, etc. Take into account what passengers will experience on a space flight (such as weightlessness), what safety equipment they might require, and other unique concerns.

Mathematics- The article read in class mentions that one consideration for a new orbital space plane design is how to get an ill astronaut from the space station to Earth in 24 hours. Research the distance from the space station to the landing spot on Earth and the speed of the shuttle in order to calculate the time it takes for a shuttle to touch down on Earth from disembarking from the space station. Take into account factors such as the space station as a moving target (the distance between a landing runway and the space station is not constant). How might a new craft be able to expedite the shuttle’s trip?
