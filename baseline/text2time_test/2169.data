The Boston Globe (Dr. Darshak Sanghavi again — sheer coincidence) had an interesting article this week making the argument that the existence of a “peanut allergy epidemic” among our nation’s children may well be overstated.

Sanghavi wrote:

[T]he medical research suggests that severe peanut allergies are not as common as people think and are surprisingly difficult to diagnose accurately. And although, as a parent, it may seem that peanut allergies have reached epidemic proportions, the evidence is surprisingly thin…. According to Anne Munoz-Furlong, a researcher and the founder of the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network, an advocacy group, today about 25 percent of parents believe that their children have food allergies, although only about 4 percent really do. A parent may suspect one after a few spit-ups or a screaming fit following a new food. Yet these are rarely true allergies. And even among children with true allergies … only a tiny fraction will have life-threatening reactions, called anaphylaxis.’

Sanghavi sought to minimize parental fears of losing a child to fatal food reactions. “[T]he Archives of Internal Medicine in 2004 reported that the average person’s chance of food-induced anaphylaxis is about 4 in 100,000 per year,” he wrote. “Roughly the same number of Americans each year die from lightning strikes as from peanut allergies.”

His article did, however, call attention to a broader health risk: the psychic dangers of over-diagnosis and over-protection. “In a 2003 study,” he wrote, “children told they were peanut allergic had more anxiety and felt more physically restricted than children with juvenile diabetes.”

I would hate to see the evidence in this article contribute to the sometimes mocking attitude that people with no direct experience of peanut allergies can have toward parents who live their lives in mortal fear. You need only once to hear the story of a parent whose child came close to dying from peanut exposure to understand why the fear runs so deep, is so persistent and is so indifferent to statistics that argue for greater calm.

Yet, the paradox contained in Sanghavi’s warning — that protective parenting practices may, in fact, be as toxic as the dangers they purport to guard against — is one you hear repeated, time and again, by child development specialists these days.

It’s a message we as parents clearly ought to heed. But it tends to fall on deaf ears, and the reasons for that, I think, go beyond the specific fears parents have about food anaphylaxis or child abductions, or any of the other horrible things we lose sleep over late at night.

If people persist in believing that potentially deadly food allergies are six times more prevalent than they really are; if parents persist in believing that the medico-industrial complex, with government permission, is poisoning their kids through vaccines; if they persist in believing our world is increasingly full of predators when, in fact, the rate of sex crimes against children is down, it’s because they don’t feel safe globally. They do not feel secure in their abilities to take care of their children. And they do not feel that there’s a support system in place to help them keep their kids safe and well. They can’t rest assured that the people charged with taking care of their kids are actually doing their job. This starts, on the most basic level, with pediatric care — or non-care, as the case may be.

An anecdote illustrating this came to mind after I read Sanghavi’s article. It was told to me by a Washington mom of my acquaintance. A couple of years ago, she’d been home at lunchtime with her son, who was eating a peanut butter sandwich. He began to look and act strangely.

She called her doctor — a prominent local pediatrician. He said he “wasn’t concerned” about the red dots around her son’s mouth. He didn’t tell this to her directly; he didn’t take calls from parents outside of his regular “call hour” in the morning, when his line was, of course, always busy. He relayed the message through his harried nurse.

The mom, though, was too “neurotic” to take this brushoff lightly. She kept the nurse on the line, long enough for her son to fall asleep, long enough for her to realize that she could not rouse him from his sleep, at which point she raced him to an emergency room, where her son escaped death, the doctors there said, with precious little time to spare. The child survived; his mother was left with post-traumatic stress disorder.

This is an individual anecdote, for sure. But the kind of relationship — or non-relationship — between doctor and patient that it describes is all too common in America these days. While there’s no limit to the number of “helping” professionals ready to step forward to guide, shape and medicate kids through every stage of their development, something human, something real, some feeling of safety has been lost in our world of diagnosis codes, telephone triage and $30 fees for filling out summer camp forms.

The quickie appointment, the self-assured specialist hiding behind his firewall of nurses, the lack of access, the lack of human contact, of conversation, follow-up and compassion is, unfortunately, the norm for many parents trying to secure medical care for their children, at every level of the socioeconomic spectrum. That, at least, was the finding of a major survey of 400 pediatricians in 38 states conducted by Children’s National Medical Center here in Washington back in 2003.

That study found that because of insurance restrictions, the average length of time pediatricians now spend with their patients is only 8 to 12 minutes — “not enough time to properly diagnose and treat a child,” in the words of Dr. Peter Holbrook, chief medical officer of Children’s National Medical Center.

What’s lost in these brief encounters is connection, information and, above all, trust. No wonder parents suspect that their children aren’t really being taken care of — and that they’re not really being fully informed. No wonder they turn to friends, parenting magazines and fear-mongering sites on the Internet for information. No wonder some end up taking medical matters into their own hands, or turning to sympathetic alternative practitioners — sometimes with fatal results.

“The system is broken,” Holbrook said at the time of the Children’s study. Amen.

Our insurance-driven medical culture lays the groundwork for the “paranoid parenting” style that has become so very common in our time. To fix it, we don’t have to rid our children’s world of allergens. Or pump our reservoirs full of Paxil to shut up “neurotic” parents. We’ve got to change the way medicine is practiced, so that care replaces profit as the currency of office visits, and so that parents’ trust and sense of safety can be restored.
