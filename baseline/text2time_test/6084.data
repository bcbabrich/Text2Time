Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin, charges that New York City's emergency repair program for rundown housing is riddled with mismanagement and ineptness by city agencies and with excessive charges And poor work by contractors, causing a loss of half the $7.5 million spent on the program last year.

In an audit of the program completed last week, but not yet generally made public, Mr. Goldin described the program in terms .similar to those used by Mayor Beame when he was the Comptroller in 1972.

At that time, during the majoralty of John V. Lindsay, the emergency repair program was mired in scandals, which included charges of questionable contract arrangements, loose procedures and overpayments for work. Steps were subsequently taken that were designed to remove the abuses.

The program, dating from 1965, seeks to restore essential services and remove dangerous conditions when private landlords fail to do so in their apartment buildings. The city hires contractors to do the jobs and then seeks to recoup the costs from the landlords.
