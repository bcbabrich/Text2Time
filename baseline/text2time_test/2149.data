These are tumultuous times for flamboyant developer Donald Trump.

First the Wall Street Journal printed a detailed article suggesting The Donald’s name has been “tarnished” by the lackadaisical results posted by several projects carrying his name. “Even the Trump name isn’t bigger than the calamitous condo market,” concluded the WSJ article, which focused on Florida properties.

That prompted an angry response from Trump, who described the article as “one of the most ridiculous I have read in many years.” (Subscription required to read full letter.)

Now he’s embroiled in a controversy in Scotland over his attempt to build a €1.4 billion seaside golf resort, including two golf courses, a luxury hotel and about 1,500 homes north of Aberdeen. In a setback for Trump, the local town council rejected the plan as out of scale with the area. Mr. Trump was “shocked” a spokesman told the Associated Press.

But Trump’s fans are fighting back and an emergency meeting has been called, as detailed in this story in the Financial Times.

Meanwhile, in a front page story, the Aberdeen Evening Express labeled the councilors who voted against the project, “You Traitors.”

In an interview with the paper, Trump said he felt he had let down his late mother—who was Scottish—in failing to win approval for the project.
