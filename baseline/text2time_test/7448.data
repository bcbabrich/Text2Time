AUSTIN, May 31—President Johnson returned to Washington from Texas tonight, having delivered two well‐received speeches in his home state and made some progress in calming one of its perennial political wars.

His schedule this week includes meetings tomorrow with Prime Minister Levi Eshkol of Israel and Friday with the Shah of Iran, a speech in New London, Conn., Wednesday and another in New York Saturday.

At the top of the week's events, however, will be the reports Mr. Johnson will receive from Honolulu, where top Administration officials, military officers and diplomats will meet tomorrow and Tuesday to reassess United States policy in southeast Asia, particularly Laos.

Though facing a busy week, Mr. Johnson probably drew satisfaction from his three‐day weekend in Texas. He got plenty of rest, scarcely leaving his LBJ ranch 65 miles from here, and the weather was pleasant except for one round of thundershowers.
