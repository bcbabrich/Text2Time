Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Consider epidemics that have affected animal populations.

2. Learn about a fatal disease decimating the Tasmanian devil population and efforts to protect them from extinction by reading and discussing the article “In Tasmania, the Devil Now Faces Its Own Hell.”

3. In groups, research a specific disease that affects an animal species and create a poster that summarizes the relevant facts.

4. Write a fictional story for children about the animal and the disease.

Resources / Materials:

-classroom board

-pens/pencils

-paper

-student journals

-poster board (enough for each research group of 4 students)

-markers (enough for the class to share)

-glue or other adhesive

-copies of the article “In Tasmania, the Devil Now Faces Its Own Hell,” found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050601wednesday.html (one per student)

-copies of the graphic “A Vicious Disease’s Relentless Spread,” found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/students/pop/articles/tasgraphic.html

-resources for researching wildlife and diseases, including science journals, encyclopedia, atlases, newspapers, textbooks and computers with Internet access

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Prior to class, write on the board the definition of epidemic, defined in the American Heritage Dictionary as “Spreading rapidly and extensively by infection among many individuals in an area. An outbreak of contagious disease that spreads rapidly.”

Upon entering class, direct students to form pairs and work together to brainstorm responses to the following question, also written on the board prior to class: “What are some current and past epidemics that have threatened to decimate human or animal populations?” Some examples are bubonic plague, HIV/AIDS, Ebola, influenza, polio, cholera, anthrax, smallpox, syphilis, avian flu, SARS, hoof and mouth disease, tuberculosis.

After a few minutes, allow students to share their answers with the class, and write them on the board. After a few minutes, ask them to consider the ways in which the epidemics have been contained or eliminated, if at all. What efforts are being made to diagnose, contain and treat existing epidemics?

2. As a class, read and discuss “In Tasmania, the Devil Now Faces Its Own Hell” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050601wednesday.html), focusing on the following questions:

a. Who are Rosie, Harry and Clyde?

b. What occurred within months of their birth?

c. Where are orphaned devils housed and under what conditions?

d. Why is Nick Mooney concerned about their well-being?

e. What percentage of devils who contract the illness die? How many have died from the disease?

f. What are the symptoms of devil facial tumor disease?

g. What do scientists think is the cause of the disease, and how might it be transmitted?

h. What steps have officials taken to contain the outbreak?

i. How does the article describe the physical and behavioral characteristics of the Tasmanian devil?

j. How did the animal get its name?

k. How do devils breed?

l. How does Dr. Menna Jones describe the normal life cycle of a Tasmanian devil?

m. How does he describe the disease?

n. What three hypotheses have been suggested about the cause of devil facial tumor disease?

o. Why might the animals be incapable of fighting off the tumor cells?

p. How does the disease differ in the way it affects Tasmanian devils and dogs?

q. For what two reasons is Dr. Mooney’s team trapping devils around the island?

r. At what age does the disease usually appear?

Then review and discuss the associated graphic “A Vicious Disease’s Relentless Spread” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/students/pop/articles/tasgraphic.html), focusing on the following questions:

a. What bodies of water surround Tasmania?

b. Where is Tasmania in relation to Australia?

c. What region appears to be free of the disease, and why?

d. In how many devil-inhabited areas has the disease been found?

3. Explain to students that they will work in groups to research a disease affecting an animal species, and create a poster that summarizes their findings. Put students into small groups of four and give each group a sheet of poster board and markers. Each group should divide its poster into quadrants labeled “The Disease,” “The Animal,” “The Environment” and “Solutions or Cures.” Each group chooses a disease from the list provided below, and each student per group chooses one category to research. Each one then writes a summary of his or her research on one quadrant of the poster. Students are encouraged to use visual resources such as maps, photographs and illustrations to flesh out their posters.

DISEASES: Ebola (Ebola hemorrhagic fever), cancer, mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy), chronic wasting disease (Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy), West Nile virus, avian influenza (bird flu), hoof and mouth disease (also known as foot and mouth disease), rabies, anthrax, tuberculosis, swine fever (or hog cholera, also known as African swine fever).

Research questions include the following (copied into a handout for easier student access):

THE DISEASE

-What is the disease? What animal(s) does it primarily affect?

-When and where was it discovered?

-Where does it currently exist? Find or draw a map of the areas.

-How is it contracted or spread?

-How does the disease affect the infected animal? What are the symptoms?

-How long can the animal live with the disease?

-What are the effects on the animal? Is it fatal or curable?

-At the height of the epidemic, how many and/or what percentage of animals died?

-Does the disease currently constitute a danger to the species? If so, how?

THE ANIMAL

-What animal does the disease primarily involve or affect?

-What is the diet and nutrition of a healthy animal of this species? How does the disease affect the animal’s diet, if at all?

-Where is the animal’s natural habitat?

-What is the normal behavior for the animal? How might the disease affect its behavior, if at all?

-What is the normal life cycle for the animal? How might the disease affect its mating and breeding patterns and/or life span?

THE ENVIRONMENT

-Where are the habitats of the animals that are affected by the disease?

-What environmental factors may contribute to the evolution and/or spread of the disease?

-How might the decimation of the species affect the environment?

-How have humans contributed to the development or spread of the disease, if at all?

-What are the effects of the disease on humans, if any?

TREATMENTS OR CURES

-Is the disease treatable? Is it curable? If so, how?

-Is the disease containable? If so, how?

-If the disease is fatal, what steps have been taken to prevent the species from becoming extinct?

-Is the disease transmissible to other species? If so, what steps are scientists taking to eliminate or contain the disease from spreading to other species, including humans?

-What steps are local governments taking, if any, to protect the species from extinction?

Groups should present their posters to the whole group in the following class period and then discuss: What, if any, responsibility do humans have in diagnosing, treating or containing natural diseases that harm animal species? Who, if anyone, should bear the primary responsibility (individuals, scientists, governments)?

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually, students incorporate the research conducted in class to write a short story for children in which the animal you researched is a main character. The story should include details about the individual animal, the species and their experiences with the disease, to teach children about the animal and the disease. Stories may include visual references such as drawings, illustrations, maps or photographs. Have students share their stories in a later class or donate them to an elementary school science class.

Further Questions for Discussion:

-Should scientists try to save the Tasmanian devils? Why or why not?

-What might happen to the Tasmanian ecosystem if scientists are not successful in finding a cure for devil facial tumor disease?

-Should humans always strive to save all species from extinction? Why or why not?

-Are any animals in your ecosystem threatened by disease or extinction? What are they and what efforts would you make to protect them, if any?

-What responsibility, if any, should humans have in protecting animals from extinction when the causes appear to be natural (as opposed to being caused by human behavior or involvement)?

2. Research and write a 2-page essay that discusses interesting animal rituals common to various animals, such as mating, breeding, child-rearing, fighting, playing, migrating, etc.

3. Research how species get their scientific and colloquial names? For example, the Sarcophilus harrisii is know as the Tasmanian devil. Prepare a fact sheet with this information to present to the school library.

4. Prepare a How It Works poster about tumors. What are they? How and why do they grow? Where can they manifest and how do they affect the body? Are all tumors fatal?

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Civics – Write an essay on how your country’s government responds to crises in the animal kingdom. How does an epidemic become a government concern? Research the steps to defining a new species of animal, declaring and responding to a crisis and adding species to the endangered species list.

Fine Arts – Create a comic strip about an animal. What are the physical and behavioral characteristics of the animal? Give it a name and a story.

Media Studies – Create an ad campaign alerting people to a disease threatening an animal species.

Teaching with The Times – Read The New York Times each day over the course of a month and cut out any articles related to illnesses or diseases that affect wildlife. Write a summary assessing efforts around the world to develop cures for animal diseases. To order The New York Times for your classroom, click here.
