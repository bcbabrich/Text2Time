Harold Holzer, a vice president at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, introduced Mario Cuomo and Newt Gingrich at their Cooper Union appearance last night.

He recalled the first time he met Mr. Cuomo –- in the same room, during the 1977 mayoral race, when a man crashed a political event there and threw a cream pie at Mayor Abraham D. Beame. He said Mr. Cuomo promptly tackled the man. [Update: Or did he?]

Mr. Holzer recalled: “I can still see one object coming this way and one object going that way.”

Update: Mr. Holzer expands on the story below, but a reader questions his accuracy. In this post, Comment Zone: More Pie, we take a look at the clips and check the recollection of the Times reporter who was there.
