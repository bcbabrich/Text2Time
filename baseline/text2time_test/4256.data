Now that the auto makers are in that box, Mr. Bieber clearly relishes keeping them there, insisting that they sell all 60,000 and create all 15,000 new jobs. "By God, I'll tell you this, we're going to keep tabs of how many are sold there, and we're going to remind people of this," he said. Parts Supplier Movements

While he does not expect the auto makers to move assembly plants to Mexico overnight, Mr. Bieber said he thought they would begin pushing their parts suppliers to relocate there in pursuit of lower-cost labor.

In a recent interview at Solidarity House, the U.A.W.'s headquarters here, Mr. Bieber reflected both on his recent defeat on the trade agreement and on what most auto analysts regard as his recent victory over the Big Three in national labor contract negotiations. As he spoke about the future of labor and of his union -- whose diverse but declining membership includes not only auto workers but state employees and jai alai players -- he adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward Mr. Clinton, whose support he acknowledged he needs to fulfill a broad legislative agenda.

"I have great respect," Mr. Bieber allowed with the faintest of grins, "for his ability to get people to vote his way."

Indeed, Mr. Bieber has not taken the big picture of him with Mr. Clinton off his office wall, despite the irony that the President's scribble has acquired since the trade agreement vote: "with thanks for all your help."

"We worked hard in 1992 to help elect Bill Clinton President of the United States," Mr. Bieber said. "I have no regrets." Fourth and Final Term at U.A.W.

At 65, Mr. Bieber, a hulking man and a tenacious bargainer, is serving his fourth and final term as U.A.W. president. He will retire in 1995, ending a career with the U.A.W. that began in 1949.
