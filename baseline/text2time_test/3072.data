Gateway Inc. in San Diego, the computer maker, said yesterday that it would take its account in-house, a move that had been expected. Billings were estimated at $250 million.

The shift came after the breakdown of talks to assign the account to the Minneapolis and New York offices of Fallon Worldwide, part of the Publicis Groupe. Fallon was to replace McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising -- part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies -- which parted ways with Gateway in February after three years.

The Gateway in-house team will work with Henry Corra, a documentary filmmaker, and his company, Corra Films in New York; on several occasions, Gateway bypassed its agency of record to work with Mr. Corra on television commercials.
