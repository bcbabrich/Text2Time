The Superintendent's announcement was made within hours after the Board of Education, whose members have been critical of Dr. Gross issued a statement calling upon the Surecommendations to improve education.

The one‐sentence statement said:

“The Board of Education, in accordance with its continually expressed desire to improve the degree of quality education in underprivileged areas, has requested the Superintendent of Schools to present to the board prior to the opening of school in September, 1964, a realistic and feasible plan whereby there can be assured for the future a greater number of more experienced teachers and supervisors in those schools especially requirihg the services of such staff personnel and further that, to the extent feasible, the implementation of such a plan commence with the opening of school in September, 1964.”

The board members have in the past privately criticized Dr. Gross for not exerting leadership and for failing to submit concrete plans for action.

Asked whether there was any connection between the board's statement and the announcement by Dr. Gross, a spokesman for the school system replied that “it was just a coincidence.”

Dr. Gross later issued the following comment: “Better staffing of schools in disadvantaged areas has been a goal of the school system for a long time. It is unquestionably an urgent problem. The staff and I have been at work at it right along. The present situation calls for every possible bit of speed that can result in real and lasting improvement in the classrooms.
