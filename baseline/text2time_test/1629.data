With less than two days to go before the N.F.L. playoffs, the Giants are the choice of Las Vegas oddsmakers to repeat as Super Bowl champions. Sports books are giving 2-to-1 odds on the Giants, the National Football Conference’s No. 1 seed, according to The Associated Press. The Tennessee Titans are the favorite American Football Conference team at 4-1.

But the conventional wisdom of New York Times readers gives a bit of a different look at how some think the postseason will unfold. As of noon Thursday, almost one in three people who filled out brackets in The Times’s Inside the Playbook Challenge said the Giants would win, but the Indianapolis Colts were the favorite pick of Times readers among A.F.C. teams. With almost 4,700 brackets entered, 15 percent predicted that Peyton Manning, and not his brother Eli, would end up with the Lombardi Trophy. And if he does, Times readers said Peyton and the Colts would be able to post a slightly higher margin of victory. Among the 30 percent of participants who picked the Giants in the Super Bowl, the average margin of victory is 4.6 points. Those who picked the Colts predicted they would win by 5 points.

They must have faith that Peyton Manning and the Colts’ offense will be able to execute their three-receiver shotgun set

with the sort of precision they’ve shown while winning nine consecutive games. You can see — from multiple angles — how Manning, Marvin Harrison, Reggie Wayne and Anthony Gonzalez make it work in this Inside the Playbook video rendering.

But don’t dismiss the San Diego Chargers, warns The Times’s Judy Battista. “The Chargers eliminated the Colts from the playoffs last season, and the Colts needed a last-second field goal to beat the Chargers in November,” Battista writes. “The most critical difference between then and now: the Chargers’ pass defense was once the worst in the league, but entering last Sunday’s game against the Broncos, they had allowed just three passing touchdowns and intercepted six passes in the previous three games.”

And Times readers have indicated faith in the Chargers’ ability to score points, too, what with their ability to get the backup running back Darren Sproles more involved in the offense. (You can watch a typical Chargers screen-pass play here.) Although only 3 percent of participants so far have chosen San Diego to win the Super Bowl, their average margin of victory is more than 5 points, better than the Colts’. The only team predicted to win the Super Bowl by a greater average margin of victory: The Baltimore Ravens. Only 2.5 percent of readers predicted the Ravens would win it all, but those readers said the rookie quarterback Joe Flacco and the Ravens’ power running game would win by an average of 5.8 points.

Watch how they do it here. It’s done on the ground. After all, the Ravens were one of the worst teams in the league (28th) in passing offense, averaging 176 yards a game. But they racked up an average of 149 yards a game rushing — fourth best in the N.F.L.
