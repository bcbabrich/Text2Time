Here’s the second of our mini-profiles of third-party candidates for New York State comptroller. [Earlier: Willie Cotton, Socialist Workers Party.]

John J. Cain is the Libertarian Party candidate. Mr. Cain has a master’s degree, works in the insurance industry and lives in Congers, Rockland County.

Strange but true: When he served on the Clarkstown Planning Board, he was offered a bribe and wore a wire for federal investigators in a case that led to the conviction of the county Democratic Party chairman. (The defendant was a former chairman of Hillary Rodham Clinton’s first Senate campaign.)

In his League of Women Voters questionnaire, Mr. Cain says he would like to stop prosecuting victimless crimes, put everyone in state government on a 401k instead of a pension and get the government out of the health care business.

Even his supporters can’t resist the puns: “He’s Cain and Hevesi’s Not Able.”

We invite them or Mr. Cain himself to expand on his background and positions in the comments.
