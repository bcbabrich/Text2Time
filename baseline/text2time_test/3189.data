Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes – 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Identify the Web sites that comprise their “personal Web communities” and reflect on the routes they take to the Internet sites they use.

2. Learn how and why Web addresses are changing by reading and discussing “Web Addresses Sprout New Suffixes, Needed or Not.”

3. Investigate how various basic elements of the Internet work.

4. Create posters illustrating their understanding of how the Internet works; map out their “personal Web communities” as a true network on the Web.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-paper

-pens/pencils

-classroom blackboard

-copies of the article “Web Addresses Sprout New Suffixes, Needed or Not” (one per student)

-markers or colored pencils

-large sheets of paper (one per group)

-computers with Internet access (at least one per group)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Students respond to the following prompt in their journals (written on the board prior to class): “What are your favorite Web sites? List at least three URLs (Web addresses) of the sites that you think make up your ‘personal Web community.’ You might include where you go on the Web for news, reference information, movie listings, entertainment, games, hobbies, special interests, museums, cultural information, and educational information. Now, think about how you access each of these sites. Do you type the URLs directly? Do you have them ‘book-marked’? Do you go through an instant messaging service or through links on other Web pages to get to some of these destinations? Sketch a map that depicts the routes you take to access this community of Web sites.” After five minutes, invite students to share some of their answers, and sketch a map on the board that defines a class Web community, connecting similar sites to each other. What are some of the Web addresses? What information is contained in all URLs? What are the different extensions — .com, .org, .net, .gov, .edu, etc. — for the sites that students listed? What does the extension tell users about the destination?

2. As a class, read and discuss the article “Web Addresses Sprout New Suffixes, Needed or Not,” focusing on the following questions:

a. What is a cybersquatter? What was the “Internet gold rush”? Why did cybersquatters buy Web address during the Internet gold rush?

b. Why has the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann) issue new domain extensions?

c. What are the four general domains now available?

d. According to the article, who manages the domains? Who sells domain names to the public?

e. What problems have the registries managing .biz and .info encountered, according to the article?

f. According to the article, what advantage does a .name domain offer consumers?

g. In addition to the extensions approved by Icann, what other domain extensions are available worldwide?

h. How has New.net gotten around the Icann-approved extensions? What does a user need to use the domains registered by this company?

3. Divide the class into groups. Explain that each group will create a presentation poster that explains how the Internet works, focusing on the questions below (written on the board for easier student access). You may want to direct students to How Web Servers and the Internet Work (//www.howstuffworks.com/web-server1.htm), Matrix.net Internet Research (//www.matrix.net/research/), and Anatomy of a URL (//www.colby.edu/web_class/URL/anatomy.html.

–What does “URL” mean?

–What is an ISP?

–What happens when you type a URL into a browser?

–How does a browser communicate with a name server?

–In a URL, what is the difference between the “hypertext transfer protocol,” domain name, and file name?

–What is an IP address?

–What is a port?

–What does the Web server do?

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Groups develop posters to present their answers in graphic form (cartoon, storyboard, or annotated diagram) to describe how the Internet works. In a future class, tape the posters around the room and ask each group to present what they learned. Then, ask students to revisit their journal entries from the initial activity in this lesson and to redraw their personal Web communities as a true network, showing a more detailed route through the modem and local, regional and world ISPs to each site server.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–Why is the Internet called a matrix?

–What is the difference between an URL and a URI?

–How can the anchor address in a URL be used to streamline Web searches?

–Should companies have “first rights” to domain names? Why or why not?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on initial journal response, participation in class discussion and group research, well-developed posters explaining how the Internet works, and thoughtful completion of maps of their “personal Web communities.”

Vocabulary:

frenzy, exorbitant, generic, numeric, accredited, registrar, glitches, constituted, invalidate, preliminary, initial, designated, implemented

Extension Activities:

1. As an advanced study to the main activity, create annotated diagrams that describe one or more of the following: How do cookies work? What is an FTP server? How do “dynamic” Web sites differ from “static” sites?

2. Who creates Internet standards? Should everyone be allowed to register any domain name? Should some suffixes (for example, .edu or .gov) be reserved only for some institutions (educational or governmental, respectively)? Research the organizations and agencies that regulate the Internet, and write an editorial article arguing for or against standards for domain name registration. How do the decisions about domain registration affect the freedom of the Internet?

3. Create an imaginary Web site. Does your site sell or provide a product or service or other resource? What domain name and extension would you choose? Go to Network Solutions (//www.networksolutions.com/) or another company that registers domain names, and search for the name. Keep searching until you find one that is available.

4. Write an essay that compares and contrasts domain-name extensions to telephone area codes. Who determines area codes? What new area codes exist for toll-free numbers? Why are new numbers added? What would be the advantages for a company matching its domain name to alpha-numeric phone number? How would this be done?

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Economics- Research some domain-name registrars at the Icann’s List of Accredited Registrars (//www.icann.org/registrars/accredited-list.html). Compare prices for registering a domain name at several sites, and write a Guide to Registering a Domain Name. What is the least expensive registration? How long would you have to register a domain name to get the best price rate? What different services do registrars offer, and what value do these services provide to registrants?

Geography/Global History- Create a map of global domain extensions by printing out a blank world map from The Florida Geographic Alliance(//fga.freac.fsu.edu/pdf/world/world_blank.pdf) and writing in the two-letter domain extension for each country, found at Babel(//alis.isoc.org/langues/iso639.en.htm). Include with your map a summary statement of the efforts by the Internet Society and Alis Technolgies to make the Internet more inclusive of languages that use different character sets [see Babel’s Character Encoding page (//alis.isoc.org/codage/index.en.html)].

Journalism- Conduct a poll of Internet use in your school or community and write an article describing Internet literacy. How often do respondents surf the Internet? How many know the terms “protocol,” “IP address” and “port”? How many know how a browser calls a Web page? Is there a link between the hours spent on the Internet and a respondent’s understanding of how the Internet works? Include in your article tips gleaned from respondents that would be useful to other Internet users.
