The Suttons and their newspaper, The Democrat Reporter, with a circulation down to 6,000, finally won. The sheriff and two top deputies went to prison last year for a variety of crimes that the paper had chronicled over the last several years. Since then, reporters from around the country have traveled to this hamlet in southwestern Alabama to ask the Suttons if they had ever feared for their lives.

Sitting in the offices of the newspaper his father bought in 1917, Mr. Sutton said he probably should have feared for the safety of his wife and two sons. But he just had a feeling that everything would be fine, he said, a sense of confidence that he never fully understood until the day last December the sheriff went to prison on extortion and bribery charges, the day he knew the ordeal was finally over.

''I was at home, and I'd just sat down with a crossword puzzle and a drink when the phone rang,'' Mr. Sutton said. ''It was an elderly man, and he told me that he knew me and my family were in danger. 'But every night,' he told me, 'I'd get down on my knees and pray for you and your family, for your safety.'

''I think my own prayers kind of just ricocheted off the ceiling,'' Mr. Sutton said, smiling. ''But all the years I had felt there was a shield around us, protecting us.'' That caller ''was the epitome of the people who stood behind us all those years,'' he said, adding, ''I'd stand in the middle of the railroad track and fight a freight train for those people.''

The answer might not make sense to anyone but Goodloe Sutton, a man in his late 40's who is harangued by friends and enemies alike when he strolls in his black penny loafers through the center of town. But that is his story, and he is sticking to it.
