Asked about atrocities attributed to his forces, Mr. Taylor said at a news conference today that the course of the war had been set by God.

"I just believe in the destiny of man being deemed by God, and wars, whether manmade or what, are directed by a force," he said. "And so when I say it is God's war, God has his own way of restoring the land, and he will restore it after this war."

After starting Liberia's civil war in December 1989 with an attack by two dozen fighters who penetrated the country from neighboring Ivory Coast, Mr. Taylor messily succeeded in his initial goal of bringing down the dictator Samuel K. Doe, a brutal, unschooled army sergeant.

But a West African peacekeeping force led by Nigeria prevented Mr. Taylor from taking Monrovia, and in time the proliferation of other militias, each more violent and undisciplined than the last, forced Mr. Taylor to content himself with Gbarnga, and kept him supplied with enemies. Before war tore the country into separate fiefs, Liberians, many of whom are the descendants of freed American slaves, were relatively prosperous.

Another factional leader, Alhaji Kromah, the leader of the Ulimo Militia, which for much of the war was the principal rival of Mr. Taylor's forces, arrived at Monrovia's airport today.

Ismael Diallo, one of the thousands of people who gathered early today to greet him said, "I don't support any of these people, I only support peace."

As bands beat out rhythms on drums and crowds broke into traditional dances, Mr. Diallo, who said he had lost several family members to the conflict, said what many Liberians have been thinking in recent days: "This country has been robbed of its life for six years. Our only hope is that we have come to our senses."
