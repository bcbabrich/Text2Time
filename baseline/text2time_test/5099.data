His batting average dropped from .289 to .263 to .244, his home runs from 40 to 28 to 18, his r.b.i. from 108 to 84 to 56.

''That's explainable,'' Syd Thrift, the Yankees' trademaker, said when asked about the decline in Barfield's production. ''Last year you have to throw out because he played with a wrist problem, which has been corrected. He swung well against us this year and we had a scout look at him in California.''

Barfield, however, hasn't provided any indication of a return to his former plateau of production. He is batting .200 this season and has struck out 28 times in 80 times at bat, a ratio more suitable to Bo Jackson. He has hit five home runs - the Yankees, as a team, have eight - but he has driven in 11 runs, the same number Roberto Kelly has as the Yankees' No. 9 hitter. Whatever his recent past, though, Barfield is the Yankees' right fielder of the immediate future.

Hal Morris was the right fielder yesterday. Playing the first game of what should be a two-day visit to New York, he looped a single to right field in the first inning, driving in Slaught.

A minute earlier, Slaught blooped a fly ball near the right-field line that Ivan Calderon could not catch with a diving try. The three runners, who had reached base against Melido Perez with two out, all scampered home.

Asked after the game if he would have liked to have seen Slaught bunt in that situation, Jeff Torborg, the Chicago manager, laughed and said, ''Yeah.'' Slaught Bunt Angered Sox

In the seventh inning of Saturday night's game with the Yankees ahead by 7-2, Slaught bunted twice trying for a hit - both bunts went foul - and the White Sox felt he was trying to embarrass them. Torborg yelled at him from the dugout, and Terry Bevington, the first-base coach, went at the catcher, and they wound up wrestling on the ground.
