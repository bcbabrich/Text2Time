Throughout the day before the vote, Mr. Vallone and Mr. Dinkins worked to influence skeptical Council members, while modifying the plan to include assurances on recycling.

Neither the Mayor nor the Speaker could afford to be heavy-handed, their aides said. The public perception of incinerators is so poor that coercing a Council member could easily have backfired since lawmakers are ultimately more concerned about being re-elected than they are with getting help from the Mayor or the Speaker.

Mr. Vallone, therefore, refused to make voting for the plan a "leadership issue," a City Hall euphemism for a direct order with the threat of political punishment.

Mr. Dinkins relied mostly on persuasion, Council members said.

Still, while few quid-pro-quo deals were cut, Mr. Lynch conceded that if a member had been having trouble getting a city agency to respond to a local problem -- a broken traffic light for instance -- it was taken care of immediately in the lobbying. It was a measure of the importance of the vote that Mr. Lynch, who is detached from his position as Deputy Mayor to serve on the state Presidential campaign of Gov. Bill Clinton, returned to aid Mr. Dinkins with it.

One Councilwoman, C. Virginia Fields of Harlem, who switched sides to support the plan after heavy lobbying from Mr. Dinkins, said the Mayor reminded her in telephone calls that he had supported her politically in the past and made it "clear this was very important to him."

Another member who switched sides after receiving heavy pressure from the Mayor was Una Clarke, whose Crown Heights district is in the heart of Brooklyn, where most members voted no. At 7:45 P.M. on Wednesday, Mr. Lynch and the Sanitation Commissioner, Emily Lloyd, were still trying to persuade her and a handful of other Council members.

Ms. Clarke said the Mayor never offered her anything for her vote, but argued that the incinerator was not as dangerous as it had been portrayed. It was her nephew, she said, who studies environmental engineering at Harvard, who convinced her.
