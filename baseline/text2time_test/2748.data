It has been more than a decade since Leslie King and 11 other jurors in Brooklyn acquitted Lemrick Nelson Jr. of murder and manslaughter charges in the fatal stabbing of Yankel Rosenbaum. But Ms. King said yesterday that she was not surprised to hear that lawyers for Mr. Nelson, who is being tried for the third time in connection with the attack on Mr. Rosenbaum in Crown Heights in 1991, are now changing course and saying that he did, in fact, participate.

''We weren't saying he had nothing to do with it,'' she said of Mr. Nelson, whose lawyers during the two earlier trials said just that. ''We just couldn't match the charges to the evidence we were given.''

Ms. King, 35, said she and her fellow jurors knew Mr. Nelson, then 16, was nearby when Mr. Rosenbaum was attacked by an angry crowd and stabbed to death on Aug. 19, 1991, a few hours after a Hasidic Jew ran over and killed a 7-year-old black child.

The jurors also knew there was ''a good chance'' Mr. Nelson was directly involved in the stabbing, Ms. King said.
