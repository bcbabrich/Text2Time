In 1986, a Federal law addressed illegal immigration by legalizing the status of long-term undocumented aliens and imposing sanctions on employers who hire new ones. Though bureaucratic problems remain that could jeopardize some of those aliens, Congress is now turning its attention to legal immigrants with a bill that confirms two worthy principles: the importance of reuniting families and America's need for skilled workers.

Under a visa allocation system enacted in 1965, foreigners seeking permanent relocation in the U.S. are given preference if they have relatives here. That tends to favor immigrants from Asia, the Caribbean and Central America. It has also forced immigrants with no family ties, but with needed job skills, to compete with relatives of U.S. residents.

A Senate bill, sponsored principally by Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Alan Simpson of Wyoming, passed by a vote of 81 to 17 last month. It establishes two immigration categories: family members and independents, mostly workers.

At least 630,000 would be allowed to enter each year for the next three years, about 136,000 more than entered in 1988. Of the total, 480,000 would qualify under various family preferences; 150,000 would be admitted as independents. For the first time, the law would allow admission of some independent workers - up to 54,000 - without specific jobs, but with specific skills needed in the U.S. labor market. The immigration ceiling would be reviewed and adjusted every three years.
