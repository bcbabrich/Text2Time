Sydney Lewis, a Richmond arts patron, has been elected chairman of the board of trustees of the Hirshhorn Museum, the contemporary art museum of the Smithsonian Institution.

Mr. Lewis succeeds Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, who has stepped down as the only chairman in the museum's 11-year history but will remain on the board.

Mr. Lewis is the founder of the Best Products Company, the retail catalogue chain. He and his wife, Frances, are collectors of contemporary art and of art nouveau, and they are major benefactors of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond.
