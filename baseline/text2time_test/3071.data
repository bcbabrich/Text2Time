Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students will explore the considerations made when creating a full-scale amusement park and experience first-hand the problem solving techniques used by amusement park designers.



Author(s):

Rachel McClain, The New York Times Learning Network

Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Write a list of areas to consider when creating an amusement park.

2. Learn about the designing of Disney’s new California Adventure theme park by reading and discussing the article “Small Worlds to Create Bold, New Ones.”

3. In groups, create plastic overlay models of an attraction that could fit into the California Adventure theme park and discuss possible technical or aesthetic problems that might arise and possible solutions to them.

4. Individually, create models that address a technical or aesthetic problem that arose in discussing the group’s attraction.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-paper

-classroom board

-permanent markers

-clear plastic overlays (several for each group of five students)

-copies of the article “Small Worlds to Create Bold, New Ones” (one per student)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journals, students will respond to the following prompt (written on the board prior to class): When designing an amusement park attraction or ride, what are some issues one should consider? After giving students a few minutes to write, discuss student responses and create a class list on the board.





2. As a class, read the article ” Small Worlds to Create Bold, New Ones,” focusing on the following questions:

a. What toy did Mark Sumner use as the building material for the “miniature working solution” of the Imax-like ride at the new Disney theme park?

b. What is the new park called, and what types of things can be found there?

c. What were the constraints taken into account by the designers of the park?

d. Why didn’t they build a three-dimensional model of the park out of wood?

e. What type of model was used instead? How did this model work?

f. What problems were noticed as the team members toured the virtual model?

g. How does the ride Soarin’ Over California work?

h. What new feature of the park will reduce visitor wait times for rides and attractions?





3. Conduct a short class discussion comparing the class list of amusement park design considerations with the issues brought up in the article. What considerations came up in the article but were not on the class list? Why are these considerations important? Then, in groups of four or five, students brainstorm rides and attractions, beyond those mentioned in the article, that they would like to see at Disneyland’s new California Adventure theme park. Groups choose one attraction and create a “plastic overlay” model of the attraction. Each layer should be devoted to a different “layer” of the attraction to emulate the Silicon Graphics program used in the development of the real park. The layers should represent all of the different stages that people are led through in the attraction, from the outside of the attraction to the waiting line, to the attraction itself. Groups then discuss possible technical difficulties that might arise in their attraction, as well as possible solutions. Questions to use as guidelines in discussing possible difficulties include:

–Are there any parts of the attraction that might be unsafe? What precautions can be taken to make them safer?

–Can the attraction meet the demands of the thousands of visitors that will want to attend it?

–Do the different parts of the attraction fit together, both technically and aesthetically?

–Do we currently have the technology available to achieve the effects desired in the attraction? If not, what alternative methods could we use to achieve a similar effect?





4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Students individually create models that solve one of the technical problems that was evident in their group’s attraction. Students should be encouraged to use old toys and common household items to create their models. Groups then present the plan for their attraction to the class, as well as their solutions to technical and aesthetic problems.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–Do you think that Disney theme parks represent pure childhood imagination or over-commercialization? Why?

–Do you compare Disney World and Disneyland to other amusement parks, or do you consider them unique? Why?

–Why do you think people like to ride dangerous amusement park rides?

–What effect do you think Disney has had on our society?

–Have you ever heard of an “Erector Set”? Name some other toys that you know of that you would consider to be “old fashioned.”

–Do your parents have memories of Disney theme parks from their childhood? How do they remember them?

–How you ever been to a Disney theme park? What did you think of it?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated on completion of journal entries, participation in class discussion, participation in group creation of plastic overlay models, and completion of three-dimensional models addressing technical or aesthetic problems in the original attractions.

Vocabulary:

emblematic, constraints, berm, impractical, virtual, prominent, simulated, hemispheric, deemed, customize

Extension Activities:

1. Learn about the making of the original Magic Kingdom in Disney World. Find out what technical difficulties the designers confronted and how they were solved. Create a poster comparing and contrasting the design of the original Magic Kingdom with the new California Adventure Park.



2. Play “Roller Coaster Tycoon” or “Theme Park World,” both games that allow you to create and ride your own roller coaster. The Amusement Park Physics site at url (//www.learner.org/exhibits/parkphysics/) also allows you to create your own roller coaster and explains the physics behind what you are doing.



3. Conduct research about the draw of amusement park thrill rides. Interview a doctor or psychologist about why thrill rides are so appealing to so many people, and interview people of different ages about their opinions of thrill rides. Then write an article describing your findings.



4. How seriously are safety concerns taken at amusement parks? Research safety hazards at amusement parks, including deaths and injuries caused by unsafe rides and attractions and precautions taken by parks to make their rides and attractions safer. Create a poster displaying your findings, including amusement park safety statistics, newspaper headlines dealing with this topic, and pictures of rides that have been responsible for injuries and deaths.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Create a timeline of the history of amusement parks in America. Include pictures of parks and various attractions, noting the date that each park opened, dates that new rides or technologies were introduced, and other significant events associated with amusement parks.



Fine Arts- Research an old amusement park and create a three-dimensional replica of the way it looked when it first opened. Take classmates on a “tour” of the park, describing the different attractions and explaining how this park was different than the type of amusement parks that are common today.



Global History- Create a collage illustrating the influence of the Disney Corporation around the world. Include pictures of Disney theme parks, merchandise, films, and advertisements from around the world.



Media Studies- Create a video designed to amuse visitors to your theme park while they are waiting for their ride. The video should include several different features, such as an advertisement for the park, a cartoon, a commercial, or a music video.
