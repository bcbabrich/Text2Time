The district superintendent, Sonia Diaz Salcedo, hopes that the drive will call attention to district schools that work and keep enough families with high-scoring children to help lift District 1 out of the mediocre middle of achievement among the city's 32 school districts.

It is a strategy that wealthy suburbs seldom have to think about. And it is one that leads to arguments about equity. Is it possible, parents and school officials ask, to create good schools by attracting strong students without further damaging the struggling schools they leave behind?

The district began, Ms. Salcedo said, by strengthening its elementary schools, using two models, the Neighborhood School, founded by teachers, and Public School 34, a classic neighborhood school. In the last two years, P.S. 34 has been expanded to eighth grade, hoping to keep the families in the district until the children are ready to go to high school.

Many parents at the Neighborhood School say they would like their school to do the same.

At the Neighborhood School, which has grown increasingly popular over the years, the atmosphere is folksy and informal. Its philosophy is so egalitarian that the school shies away from celebrating any holidays, for fear of offending someone. It shunned textbooks for many years, though social studies and math books have begun to creep into classrooms, as parents complained that without a text, it was hard for them to help their children at home.

Parents can follow the curriculum through letters sent home by every teacher. In kindergarten, children write that they have been feeding food scraps to their worms and sketching trees in Tompkins Square Park. In sixth grade, children plan to write a screenplay based on the Salem witch trials.

It is hard to walk down the halls without bumping into a mother or father. Last week, Ken Gilbert, a lawyer wearing a dress shirt, tie and dreadlocks, led 4- and 5-year-olds in singing ''how oats, peas, beans and barley grow,'' and then, by request, ''You Are My Sunshine,'' while they inspected plants in the greenhouse.

Judith Foster, the director, an Ed Koren cartoon come to life with frizzy black hair and a look of erudite intensity, proudly tells how a father arrived, demanding a tour, after hearing about the school in Katmandu, Nepal. Asked what makes the school tick, she talks about community and empathy in the same breath as academics, and tells another story, of a little boy who could not find the bathroom. But he knew, she said, where to find his reading buddy, and he turned to the older child for help.
