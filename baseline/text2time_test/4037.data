RAIN? It couldn't rain on a Marty Richards party. Not with those panoramic views of lawn, gardens and sculptures, and that teasing sound of a pounding surf just behind the hedges. Mr. Richards's oceanfront mansion in Southampton was made for outdoor entertaining. In the summer the dinner parties on the patio -- lit by twinkling candlelight and that old devil moon -- rival any 1940's movie set.

''I remember the first party I went to,'' said Gayle Willson, who owns a wearable-art gallery in Southampton. ''There were orchids and candles floating in the pool and Gloria Vanderbilt sat at my table. I thought 'I have arrived!' ''

When one arrives at a party given by Mr. Richards, the Broadway and film producer, one never knows who will be sitting at the table. It could be Goldie Hawn, Donald J. Trump, or the gardener. The host loves to mix and match. Each of his parties is a happening, with rarely anything going wrong. The gods of partydom smile on Mr. Richards. But last weekend, the umpteenth weekend of the summer season for the male version of Pearl Mesta and his tireless staff of 12, the weather was iffy. ''I had the tents put up just in case,'' Mr. Richards said, looking up into a labyrinth of white ceilings that covered the patio and walkways into the back of the mansion.

Just as dinner began for the gathering of 84, ''which had started as 18,'' said his personal assistant, Joseph Dulek, the rains came. For a moment there was stunned silence as a torrential downpour pounded on the tents. Streams of water flowed down every fold of the temporary ceiling. Then a slight wind made the streams flow more in the direction of the seated guests. In unison, a table of 10 stood up. There was only one thing to do. The diners, including a countess and the wife of a famous singer, picked up the table and moved it back from the spray. Seated once again, they picked up their forks and dove into the lobster, shrimp and mussel paella. As the heavens continued to open, the rain was drowned out by the laughter of dinner conversations and the band playing ''Satin Doll.''
