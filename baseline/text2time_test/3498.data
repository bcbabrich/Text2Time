WHEN Rome was liberated in 1944, Italian culture, like a patient barely recovered from a crippling illness, stretched its limbs and began to walk, then run. Innovative films by Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio De Sica and others caught the vertiginous aura of this moment, as did the fiction of a generation of writers who had spent the war years in the resistance or in hiding. In ''Open City: Seven Writers in Postwar Rome,'' an anthology that inaugurates the Steerforth Italia imprint, the eminent translator William Weaver offers a generous sampling of their work.

The immediate postwar period was a heady time for Italian literature. Alberto Moravia and his wife, the novelist Elsa Morante, reappeared from their covert retreat in Fondi; Ignazio Silone came home after 13 years of exile in Switzerland; and Carlo Levi (having written his masterpiece, ''Christ Stopped at Eboli,'' while in hiding in Florence) moved to Rome to edit a newspaper. Within days of the fall of Fascism, Giorgio Bassani abandoned his native Ferrara, where he had been imprisoned, for Rome. These writers were joined by Carlo Emilio Gadda, a key figure in Italian modernist literature, and the journalist and novelist Natalia Ginzburg.

''That thrilling postwar explosion of the Italian genius has inevitably been muted by time and by subsequent Italian excitements, from Fellini to Eco,'' Weaver observes in his ingratiating introductory memoir. ''But the validity of that first, postwar discovery is beyond question; and this anthology hopes to recapture some of the varied, urgent spirit of that time.''

For the writers Weaver champions here, openness -- to sexuality, to fresh political ideas, to la dolce vita -- was everything. Not surprisingly, he has excerpted texts that subtly evince this newfound expansiveness. In ''Agostino,'' for example, Moravia depicts an adolescent's sexual awakening by focusing on the boy's frank awareness of his mother's body: ''As his mother, she had no sense of shame; but to Agostino it seemed that she was wantonly provocative. He would hear her calling him, and would go to her room to find her at her toilet, in her negligee and with her breasts half-uncovered.'' Suppressed by the Fascists, ''Agostino'' was republished in 1945 and represents the first shudder of a literary earthquake.
