Dr. Crew said he would appeal yesterday's ruling, as he will the one handed down on April 23, when Justice Douglas E. McKeon of State Supreme Court in the Bronx ruled that Dr. Crew had exceeded his authority in suspending members of District 7.

As a practical matter, there will be no immediate effect from yesterday's ruling. Members of both boards remain locked out of their offices pending Dr. Crew's appeal, and regardless of the suspensions board members can run for re-election next Tuesday, which several are doing. While the two rulings were parallel in the sense that both held that Dr. Crew had gone beyond the powers of his office in suspending the boards in February, they were strikingly different in tone.

In last week's decision, Justice McKeon said that the Chancellor had hurt some innocent people when he removed all nine board members in District 7 and that Dr. Crew seemed to have been motivated more by a television program exploring political activities in the district than by the plight of the district's 15,000 children.

In yesterday's decision on District 9, Justice Crispino hinted strongly that his ruling might have been different if Dr. Crew had submitted to him a just-completed report on corruption in District 9, and he suggested that the report could be a basis for future action against the board.

Justice Crispino focused on Carmelo Saez Jr., the president of the nine-member District 9 board, who has been repeatedly accused of corruptly using his position and presiding over the district as though it were his political fief.
