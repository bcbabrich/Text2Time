''It's freedom,'' he said. ''It has a psychological impact. People's dream -- their main concern -- is not to stop at a checkpoint. There are many people who haven't been to Gaza City in two years.''

At one point along the road, near the settlement of Kfar Darom, Israeli forces retained their direct grip on the road, forcing Palestinians to take a detour. But even at the all but deserted gas station where the road dies by the Israeli post, Mahmoud Abu Araj, a 53-year-old worker, said he had noticed a change.

''It was the first night that we didn't hear any shooting,'' he said. ''It's quiet.''

Salahadin Road, for the most part pancake-flat and arrow-straight, is the point of intersection for Gaza's hostile neighbors. After passing through Gaza's fence, most of Israel's 7,000 settlers must cross the road to reach their homes. But the more than 1.2 million Palestinians who live in Gaza rely on the road to reach jobs, schools, beaches and hospitals.

The new Palestinian police post at this spot guards a sad, tattered intersection, which the Israelis call Netzarim Junction after the settlement just to the west, and the Palestinians call by an Arabic name that translates as Martyrs' Square.

The spot was a flashpoint of the early days of the conflict. In what remains for Palestinians a searing incident, a 12-year-old Palestinian boy, Muhammad el-Dura, was shot to death here in one of those early clashes, as he sought safety behind his father. The scene was captured by a television camera. Today his father took advantage of the open road to place flowers near the spot.

Settlers in Netzarim bitterly recall having to be airlifted by helicopter to reach their families inside the settlement, as fighting shut the junction.

On all sides of the intersection here, Israeli bulldozers have leveled what were once orange and olive orchards, which the army said Palestinians had used as sniper posts.
