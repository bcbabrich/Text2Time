The exhibition is also very good on the starts and stops that marked Matisse's earlier years as a painter. As a student in his early 20's, he could produce a classroom drawing of an elderly male model that has a seraphic distinction of touch and yet spares us none of the dilapidations of age. Degas could have been guiding his hand at that point. But within the next year or two he was to thrash around this way and that in search of the idiom that would be his alone, and when he came in 1899-1900 to draw both himself and his new wife, the result was more eloquent of the sheer labor of drawing than of conjugal fulfillment. So far from looking like newlyweds who were barely out of their 20's, they look like a pair of grumpy sexagenarians who long ago ceased to have anything to say to one another.

It is the particular strength of the present show that we can watch Matisse as he gradually annexes one territory after another for drawing. Once out of the classroom (in which that archetypal mediocrity, Adolphe William Bouguereau, had said to him, ''Matisse, you will never learn to draw''), he roved as a free man. There was hardly a way of drawing or an effective instrument that he did not put to use, and he never hesitated to raid the terrains of sculpture, painting and printmaking, the better to set down his feelings in their quintessence.

For this reason, the show has an astonishing variety of scale and medium. The spectral, more-than-life-size ''Head of St. Dominic'' that he intended for the Vence chapel toward the end of his life looks as if it had been dug up from the grave. Yet not so far away is the ''Faun and Nymph'' of 1935, in which Matisse for once gave free rein to a peremptory sexuality. This was an artist who could bend the very substance of drawing to his will.

He could be stern, but he also had at his command an aerial lightness. He could be all volume, all weight, all darks and lights. But when the occasion called for it, he could use a cotton- thin unbroken line. He could draw a head (his own, especially) in such a way that we feel we could put our two hands in back of it and lift it straight out of the picture. He could draw with a large brush, heavy with black ink, on bone-white paper, and make the monster marks dance on the page.

The facts of his long career as a draftsman are very well set out both in the show, which was sponsored in New York by the Meredith Corporation, and in the catalogue, which has 220 illustrations and costs $15 in paperback. The show can be seen through May 14.

Also of interest this week: :

French 19th Century Drawings and

Oil Sketches ( Shepherd Gallery, 21 East 84th Street): In all, 97 named artists, from Amaury-Duval to Achille Zo, are represented in the Shepherd Gallery's winter miscellany, together with one or two others who are not identified. (The rather startling anatomical drawing of a human heart, for instance, has no name attached to it).
