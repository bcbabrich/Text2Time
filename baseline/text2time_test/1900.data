For Beijing, 1949 was a big year. That’s when the People’s Republic was founded, right here in the capital. It was also the year that the Beijing Machinery and Electric Institute opened a factory in the Sanlitun neighborhood. Nearly 60 years later, that long-idle industrial ruin has become the centerpiece of one of the most unusual drinking and dining complexes in town. 1949-The Hidden City opened a few weeks ago, and it’s drawing praise from diners, architecture fans, preservationists and my out-of-town visitors, who get dragged there whether they want to or not.

1949 was developed by Elite Concepts, a Hong Kong company that operates restaurants there and in Shanghai, Jakarta and Macau. The complex consists of nearly a dozen inter-connected buildings in a 55,000-square-foot walled village. About half of that is covered with trees and grass, making it an oasis of urban calm. Open so far are a Chinese restaurant, a European restaurant, a noodle bar, a coffee-and-drinks bar and an art gallery. The original factory has been preserved, and the same warm hue of red brick used to construct the other buildings. Interiors are brightened by extensive use of glass and wood.

Food’s not bad, either. Duck de Chine, the Chinese restaurant, offers a tasty, wood-fired version of the iconic local specialty, Peking duck, for 188 yuan (about $27 at the current exchange rate of 6.9 yuan to the dollar). Its arrival is signaled by a gong, and the bird is carved at your table. Good for impressing visitors. The menu includes duck several other ways, but for variety’s sake you might want to try the many pork, beef and noodle dishes. Oddly, the restaurant has a marketing arrangement with Bollinger, whose famous bubbly is the featured wine offering. Not the perfect accompaniment for duck, perhaps, but there is also a high-quality selection of reds and whites at typically elevated Beijing prices. Tip: the Ste. Michelle Riesling from Washington State, one of the cheapest on the list at 345 yuan, goes well with many Chinese dishes.

The European restaurant, 1/5 taverna, has a cosmopolitan, vaguely Spanish-tinged menu heavy on steaks, seafood and pasta. One notable offering is the roast baby lamb from Mongolia (458 yuan for a shoulder, 488 for a leg), which will feed six people. We had the leg with a Calina Reserva Carmenere, a sturdy Chilean red, for 388 yuan a bottle.

The Noodle Bar seats only 12 people around a wooden oval and offers hand-pulled noodle dishes. The airy, glass-enclosed Sugar Bar specializes in coffee concoctions but also has a full range of mixed drinks, beers and wines. A more ambitious bar, 1/5, is set to open any minute. So is the Well Bar, a circular outdoor counter built atop an old fire-fighting well.

1949-The Hidden City is so new that few taxi drivers know it. But the complex lies behind Pacific Century Place, a glitz-bathed commercial and residential complex on Gong Ti Bei Lu, between Sanlitun Nan Lu and the Third Ring Road. Better hurry: 1949 may not stay hidden for long.
