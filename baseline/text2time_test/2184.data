I’m at Kennedy Airport heading for Chad and Darfur. Lydia Polgreen of the Times had a great story from there a couple of days ago, and I’ll have my first column from there for Tuesday.

So don’t expect much on this blog for the next 10 days or so. I’ll try to file a bit by sat phone, but I’m not sure that there’ll be many opportunities as I camp out on the Chad/Sudan border.
