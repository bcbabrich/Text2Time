With all the new construction that has taken place, there are some question marks about the immediate future. Because the availability of downtown office space was extremely limited a few years ago - the vacancy rate at one point was as low as 0.2 percent - some companies have leased extra space with the intention of subletting it.

''That's a market nobody has a handle on,'' said Mr. Farley of the Farley Company. Some of the older buildings, he added, could have problems refilling their space as tenants move into the new structures.

Overall, however, Mr. Farley said that the demand for new space in downtown Hartford has increased steadily over the years. The cyclical swings in the Hartford market have been caused by a fluctuating supply of available buildings rather than changes in demand, he said.

Generally, the rental rates in the downtown area have held firm despite the new additions, according to real-estate specialists. They said that rates range from about $26 to $28 a square foot in the newest buildings to $19 to $22 in the older Class A buildings.

Hartford's development has differed in some ways from the recent corporate growth in Fairfield County. The county is regarded as part of the New York metropolitan area, and some of the more recent corporate growth there has been in campus-style rural settings, such as General Electric's headquarters in Fairfield and Union Carbide's in Danbury. Hartford, by contrast, is more of a regional center by itself, situated midway between New York and Boston, and most of its recent development has taken place in its sometimes congested downtown area.

It also is surrounded by wealthier suburban towns, home to many of its office workers, and its officials and others are concerned that the city's supply of housing, particularly for low- and middle-income residents, has not kept pace with the increase in office space.

Some neighborhood groups, for example, are urging the city to require developers to provide jobs and to build housing to obtain approval for future office buildings. Developers, in turn, said that with the recent decline in Federal housing aid, the construction of new, nonsubsidized housing in the city would require them to charge rents ranging from $1,200 to $1,500 a month, which most people cannot afford.
