Presidential politics will again dominate the conversations on the news shows on Sunday, on the weekend between the closing of the Republican National Convention and the opening of the Democratic National Convention.

As chairman of the Democratic National Convention, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles is in demand, appearing on Fox, CNN, Univision and C-Span to preview the week ahead.

In addition to Mr. Villaraigosa, “Fox News Sunday” interviews David Axelrod, Obama campaign strategist, about what the convention can do for President Obama’s re-election prospects.

CNN’s “State of the Union” will broadcast live from Charlotte, with Mr. Villaraigosa, Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland and Gov. Bev Perdue of North Carolina. Plus, Robert Gibbs and Eric Fehrnstrom, senior advisers to Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney respectively, will have an exchange over Mr. Obama’s policies.

Having served as Mr. Obama’s chief of staff, Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago offers his perspective on the president’s re-election efforts on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Also on the program will be Newt Gingrich, former Republican presidential candidate, and Carly Fiorina, former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard and vice chairwoman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

Mr. O’Malley; Bill Richardson, former governor of New Mexico; and Stephanie Cutter, Mr. Obama’s deputy campaign manager, will be in Charlotte with CBS’s “Face the Nation.”

David Plouffe, a White House adviser, who played a crucial role in getting Mr. Obama elected in 2008, talks to ABC’s “This Week” about the race, particularly how voters may be swayed by the conventions.

Univision’s “Al Punto” offers a packed program this week, with Mr. Richardson and Mr. Villaraigosa previewing the festivities in Charlotte, as well as the party’s platform and Mr. Obama’s re-election hopes. Univision will feature interviews from the Republican National Convention with Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Mr. Romney’s wife, Ann, and his son Craig, and Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida.

Mr. Villaraigosa will also talk about the convention on C-Span’s “Newsmakers.”

Mayor Anthony Foxx of Charlotte appears on Bloomberg’s “Political Capital.”

TV One’s “Washington Watch” returns from summer hiatus with a discussion of the presidential contest, especially the conventions and health care after the election.
