HAGEDORN--Horace. The North Shore-Long Island Jewish (LIJ) Health System is deeply saddened by the death of Horace Hagedorn, the former CEO of Miracle Gro Products. A long-time trustee of the North ShoreLIJ Health System, Horace was a wonderful human being and a generous contributor to countless organizations. He always gave from the heart and was committed to helping us meet the needs of the underserved. North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset's Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Cleft Palate Center are named in his honor. In keeping with his desire to help the less fortunate, he recently assisted needy children with hearing impairments in getting cochlear implant surgery at LIJ Medical Center. Horace was a great friend who will be sorely missed. Our condolences to his wife Amy and the children. Michael Dowling President & CEO Dan de Roulet Chairman North ShoreLIJ Health System
