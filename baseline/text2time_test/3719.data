MATTHEW BOURNE's production of ''Swan Lake'' opened on Broadway as something of an anomaly. Word from Los Angeles, where the production played last year, was that the show was touching but campy. Earlier reviews in England, where the show originated, tended to dwell on what this ''Swan Lake'' was not, particularly among the older dance critics.

In one of the most famous (and in some circles infamous) English reviews, the peppery veteran reviewer Clement Crisp sounded relieved to report that the relationship between the prince and swan was not homosexual. ''The swans are oddly sexless,'' Mr. Crisp wrote in The Financial Times in September 1996, when the production opened at the Piccadilly Theater, ''and when [Adam] Cooper appears as the Black Swan at the third act ball -- a brutish incarnation of erotic force -- his activities are as blatantly heterosexual as they are destructive.''

The move from a small dance house to the London equivalent of Broadway effectively took this version of the ballet classic into the realm of larger issues. Was it theater or dance? Was it straight or gay? One of the pleasures of this ''Swan Lake'' is that it is open to so many interpretations.

That richness, which has made the production a widely discussed entertainment event, comes in part from Mr. Bourne's failure to carry some of his themes through. Succumbing to the youthful, unthinking impudence that makes his production so much fun, Mr. Bourne, who was in his mid-30's when he created ''Swan Lake,'' fails entirely to prepare the viewer for his ending, when the swans savagely peck their leader to death in a major departure from the ballet scenario. And the Private Secretary -- in the ballet the evil magician Rothbart -- is involved in so many plots to drive the already fragile young prince crazy that it is sometimes almost impossible to figure out what is going on in Mr. Bourne's version of the ballet's third act.
