After lengthy negotiations, Goldman Sachs completed the purchase of nonperforming loans with a face value of $250 million from the Huarong Asset Management Company, one of four companies set up to dispose of $170 billion in bad loans at state-owned banks. Goldman did not disclose the final terms, but it had been negotiating a deal to pay as little as 10 cents on the dollar for the debts plus further payments if Goldman was able to collect an unexpectedly large part of the loans. Goldman bought the loans through a joint venture, with Huarong also a partner. Goldman and Huarong reached a preliminary agreement more than a year ago but the final pact depended on legal details that were hard to draft in a country still evolving from Communism to a market economy.
