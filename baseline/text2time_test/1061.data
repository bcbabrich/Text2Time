YANCEY--Mary Anne. The Board and staff of BRIC express our profound grief on the passing of Mary Anne Yancey, Board Chair of BRIC from 2002- 2007, and founder of the BRIC Rotunda Gallery Friends Committee. Mary Anne was a beloved friend and a gifted and dedicated leader, who led BRIC through challenging times to a bright future. The recent opening of BRIC House, a major new cultural facility in Brooklyn, was one of many successes made possible by her leadership. Our deepest condolences to her husband Dick and the entire Yancey family. Hilary Ackermann, Chair Leslie Schultz, President
