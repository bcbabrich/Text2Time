Mr. Pakman said that people's sense of ownership over music has changed. ''I actually don't think people want to carry stuff around with them,'' he said, referring to conventional music packaging like compact discs and cassette tapes. Instead, listeners who are college-age and younger tend to think of music, he said, as a service and not a product. ''We went to college campuses and asked, 'How big is your music collection?' and they would say, 'Four gigs.' ''

Music technology has come a very long way from Mr. Pakman's first real encounter with music when he was a fourth grader growing up outside Philadelphia and decided that he wanted to play the drums in the school band. By the time he was attending the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, he was studying computer science engineering and performing on weekends.

''I was always a musician and I was always a computer guy,'' Mr. Pakman said. ''I was the drummer geek.''

He worked at a video game arcade, reprogramming machines so they could play new games. ''With a name like Pakman, I had to work for a video game company,'' he said.

He did internships at Apple Computer's New Jersey offices while he was in college. After graduating in 1991, he went to work at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., where he helped to form a business development group called the Apple Music Group. Its mission was to awaken musicians, music executives and computer technologists to the potential of using computers and the Internet to market and promote music.

In the mid-1990's, Mr. Pakman said, lots of music executives were skeptical. But when Mr. Pakman met Larry Rosen, the founder of GRP, a prominent jazz label, he said Mr. Rosen understood. Soon Mr. Rosen and some others started N2K Entertainment. Mr. Pakman joined the company and rose to vice president. In 1998, when N2K merged with CDNow, Mr. Pakman left, but not before he got a call from an old associate from Apple, Doug Camplejohn, who had an idea.

That idea, Mr. Pakman recalled, was the kernel of what has become myplay. He and Mr. Camplejohn started the service in the fall of 1999. Myplay's headquarters is in Redwood City, Calif.; Mr. Pakman is based in New York.
