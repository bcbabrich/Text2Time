Among the gum wrappers, keys and broken-bristled brush was a crumpled three-week-old Lotto ticket that Beatrice Esquivel had not checked.

Now the woman and her husband, Antonio, are $8 million richer. They were the only winners in the Oct. 7 drawing. They bought the ticket at an Alameda, Calif., cookie store, which will receive $40,000.

The Esquivels will receive $400,000 annually for the next 20 years, or about $288,000 after taxes.
