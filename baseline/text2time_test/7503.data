KARACHI, Pakistan, Sept. 20—Miss Fatima Jinnah, opening her campaign for the Presidency of Pakistan, charged tonight that the Government of Field Marshal Mohammed Ayub Khan had created “an atmosphere laden with fear and reeking with corruption.”

She called upon the nation's 110 million people to “cast off the fear that by various tactics is being instilled in the mind of the common man and spread the message of freedom, democracy and social justice in the remotest corners of Pakistan.”

On the eve of her first campaign tour through West Pakistan, the 72‐year‐old Miss Jinnah urged the people not to permit the nation to drift off the course charted by her brother, the late Mohammed All Jinnah, who is revered as the founder of Pakistan.

“Come out in the open, work hard and contribute so that Pakistan may live, so that our people may thrive and become prosperous, so that generations after us may breathe freely from the air which is unpolluted by moral and political corruption,” she declared.
