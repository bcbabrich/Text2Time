When Brian Friesen was driving to work last Monday in the Vancouver, British Columbia, suburb of New Westminster, a radio news report quickened his pulse. In trading in Toronto the Canadian dollar had reversed its steep climb of the previous months against the United States currency and tumbled nearly a full United States cent in value, its sharpest one-day move in months.

''I was pleased as Punch,'' said Mr. Friesen, the 38-year-old vice president and chief financial officer of Lamford Forest Products Ltd., a manufacturer of cedar siding and paneling that exports 70 percent of its products to the United States. Because Lamford sets United States dollar prices on the $3 million of products that it sells each month in the United States, an upward movement in the Canadian dollar means losses for the company in Canadian dollars, the currency in which it reckons its revenues and profits.

So far this year the Canadian currency has been moving against the trend in the currency markets, strengthening sharply against the United States dollar at a time when other currencies, including the Japanese yen, have been trading in a narrow range with the United States currency, or, as with the West German mark, losing slightly. It is a performance that has alternately pleased and worried Canadians, who have become accustomed in recent years to their dollar trading at a discount of as much as 30 United States cents to the United States currency. A 7% Increase This Year

At the close of trading in Toronto on Friday, the Canadian dollar was quoted by the Bank of Canada at 82.56 United States cents, an increase of nearly 6 cents, or 7 percent, since the beginning of the year.
