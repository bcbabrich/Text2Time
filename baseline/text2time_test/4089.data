Normally, it is football players who can use a week's worth of practice to recover from a stunning defeat. The six days between games can be used for mental adjustment and physical improvement. Basketball teams usually don't have that luxury. Fortunately, for St. John's, it did.

The Red Storm needed this week to recover from its stunning loss to Long Island University in the season opener last Saturday. The time and practice between games seemed to be the right therapy. St. John's displayed more assertiveness and cohesion, especially defensively, in dispatching Hofstra, 77-54, last night at Alumni Hall.

Felipe Lopez scored 26 points and Zendon Hamilton added 23 as the Red Storm shot 58 percent from the field and quickly buried any notion of being upset for the second straight game. St. John's led by as many as 19 points in the first half and 26 in the second in giving Fran Fraschilla his first victory as St. John's coach.

''I thought our defensive effort and the intensity we played with was solid,'' Fraschilla said. ''The kids had their thinking caps on as far as what we wanted to do with our game plan.''
