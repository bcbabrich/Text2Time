PERHAPS the only unkind words one could venture against Arleen Auger's recital at Alice Tully Hall Sunday night is to note her lack of hotbloodedness - the kind of biting abandon Donizetti asks for in songs like ''La Zingara.'' Miss Auger's soprano technique and her musicality is so suffused with elegance, in other words, that shedding it seems impossible.

Passion, however, takes many forms - the unadorned simplicity with which she sings Mozart's ''Ridente la Calma,'' the graceful fluency that alights so delicately on Purcell's elaborate vocal lines, the pristine French of ''Dans un Bois Solitaire,'' also by Mozart and the sweet intimacy she brings to Mahler's ''Knaben Wunderhorn'' songs.

Miss Auger knows when to be reticent and invite us closer, but also when it is time to press her case more hotly. ''E pur cosi,'' from Handel's ''Giulio Cesare,'' was moving both for the power of its middle section and for the way Miss Auger darkened and deepened the repeated music at the end. This is a voice with limits - it does not explode with vocal power nor can it overwhelm us with emotional ferocity. Yet Miss Auger prospers within her limitations - indeed, makes a virtue of them.

She also sang songs by Bridge, Copland and Hoiby. Dalton Baldwin was the distinguished accompanist.
