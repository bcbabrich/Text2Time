A federal judge in Manhattan ruled Tuesday that it was unfair to hold Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s liable as “underwriters” on securities offerings needing their ratings, as he rejected fraud claims by investors on the safety of $63.4 billion of mortgage-backed debt, Reuters reports.

Judge Jed S. Rakoff issued an opinion detailing reasons behind his March 31 dismissal of class-action claims against the credit rating agencies, and some claims against Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and the ABN Amro unit of Royal Bank of Scotland. He also dismissed the case against Credit-Based Asset Servicing and Securitization, or C-Bass, which packaged debt underwritten by the banks.

Plaintiffs led by the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi had accused rating agencies and banks of misleading them about the safety of 84 mostly investment-grade offerings of residential mortgage-backed securities.

Judge Rakoff rejected the plaintiffs’ contention that the agencies should be treated effectively as underwriters because their ratings were “necessary” to distribute the securities.

“There is nothing in the complaint to suggest that the ratings agencies participated in the relevant ‘undertaking’ — that of purchasing the securities … from the issuer with a view to their resale,” he wrote.
