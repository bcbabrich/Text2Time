A brief report in the ''At the Movies'' column in Weekend on Friday about ''Kiarostami 101,'' a short by the film scholar Jamsheed Akrami about the Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, misstated plans for it. Mr. Akrami is expanding the short; it is not being shown with Mr. Kia rostami's new film, ''The Wind Will Carry Us,'' at the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas in Manhattan.
