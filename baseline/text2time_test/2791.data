Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. In groups, assess the targeted audience of a teen magazine and discuss their findings with the class.

2. Learn about Atoosa Rubenstein’s new position of Editor-in-Chief of “Seventeen” magazine by reading and discussing the article “Learning the Truth at Seventeen (It’s Cuckoo)”.

3. In groups, create a sample issue of a teen magazine targeted to a specific audience.

4. Individually, write a letter to the editor of a teen magazine offering a critique of that particular issue.

Resources / Materials:

-copies of various teen magazines (one per group)

-classroom board

-copies of the article ” Learning the Truth at Seventeen (It’s Cuckoo)” (one per student)

-demographic profiles (written on slips of paper prior to class) Profiles should briefly describe a teen demographic, such as “adolescent boys who like fantasy role-playing games”or”college-bound teenage girls in the suburbs”)

-paper

-pens/pencils

-markers

-computers with Internet access (optional)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Divide the class into groups of three or four, and provide each group with a recent teen magazine, such as “Seventeen,” “YM,” or “Teen Vogue.” Explain that students will be assessing their magazines to determine who this magazine would appeal to and why. Give students five minutes to look through the magazine and determine the type of teenager who would be attracted to this publication. Then, groups should note the overall tone and feel of the magazine, including specific articles, features, and advertisements. Instruct groups to make a list of five attributes (e.g. “academic,” “trendy,” or “pre-teen”) for the target market, with a piece of evidence to support each attribute (e.g. an advertisement for a Rugrats movie might suggest a younger audience). Once groups are finished, they should present their data and conclusions to the class.

2. As a class, read the article “Learning the Truth at Seventeen (It’s Cuckoo),” focusing on the following questions:

a. What did Atoosa Rubenstein look like as an adolescent?

b. What was Ms. Rubenstein’s last job? What is her job now?

c. How would you describe her clothing?

d. How was Atoosa greeted on her first day at her new job?

e. How does she feel about leaving her old job?

f. What does her ring symbolize?

g. What two things motivate Atoosa?

3. Students should remain in their Warm-Up groups. Assign each group a demographic description, such as “adolescent boys who like fantasy role-playing games,” “college-bound teenage girls in the suburbs,” “teenagers interested in the performing arts,” “teenagers interested in environmental issues,” or “health-conscious adolescent girls.” Explain that each group will be acting as an editorial board for a new teen magazine. The magazine is being geared toward teenagers that fit a particular demographic. Groups will work together to create a pilot magazine to illustrate how this audience will be reached. The pilot should include:

-a cover that reflects the theme of the magazine

-at least one article on a subject of interest to readers

-at least one “feature” (one or two page spreads with pictures and/or short paragraphs on a unified theme)

-at least one quiz geared toward your readers (e.g. “Are you too Snobby?”)

-a list of at least four advertisers you plan to contact to advertise in this magazine, and a short explanation of how this advertiser fits your reader profile

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually, students read a teen magazine of their choice and write a letter to the editor critiquing the magazine. How well did this particular issue meet your needs as a reader? How valuable were the articles to you? Which advertisements interested you most? Why? What would you like to see published in a future issue of this magazine? Why? What, if anything, needs to be removed from the magazines current format?

Further Questions for Discussion:

–Why does Atoosa Rubenstein seem like a good person for her job?

–Do you read CosmoGirl or Seventeen? If so, do you agree with Ms. Rubenstein’s assessment of the reader profile for these magazines?

–Is it “cool” for older people to fit in with teenagers? How would you feel if your mother acted like Atoosa Rubenstein?

–Do you believe in psychics? Why or why not? How would you feel if a psychic told you that someone was “your destiny”?

–What kinds of sacrifices do your parents make for you? How important is your education to them? How does your answer make you feel?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated on thoughtful group analysis of magazine samples, participation in class discussions, completion of group magazine, and completion of individual letters to the editor.

Vocabulary:

empowerment, diva, spawned, dyslexia, transcending, covert, firmament, venerable, self-referentially, stasis, swanning, rehabilitated, bevy, nostalgia, renaissance, portends, retrofitting, wainscoting, accoutrement

Extension Activities:

1. Read a women’s magazine and the teen magazine associated with it (e.g. “Cosmo” and “CosmoGirl,” or “Vogue” and “Teen Vogue.” Create a chart comparing the two, noting both similarities and differences. Focus on the overall theme of the magazines, general content, tone of the writing, and other distinctive features as you compare them.

2. Create a teen magazine for a teen demographic that seems to be underrepresented in current teen magazines, such as teen mothers, ethnic groups such as Jews or Latinos, or high academic achievers. Consider the type of information that would appeal to them, and the advertisers who would be included in your magazine. Create a pilot magazine similar to the one you made in class.

3. Atoosa Rubenstein overcame many challenges in order to realize her dreams. Write an essay in which you describe the challenges you face, and how you will overcome them to reach your goals in life. Include a description of someone (it could be Atoosa Rubenstein) who inspires you to keep working to reach your goals.

4. Convert your group’s teen magazine or an existing one into a television show. Write a pitch for the show describing the format (variety show, talk show, sitcom, etc) and content. If possible, record a short pilot of the show, including commercials for the products advertised in the magazine.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Some magazines have been around for a while, but have undergone many chances over the years. Find the earliest copy you can of a magazine that has been in publication for at least 50 years, such as Harpers, Good Housekeeping, or Redbook. Create a poster that compares features such as articles, polls, fashion, amount of advertising, and other elements of the magazine then and now.

Economics- Compare distribution, price, frequency of publication, and net worth of the top three most profitable teen magazines. If possible, contact the public relations departments of the magazines and find out about their mission statements, their target demographic, and what they feel are their strengths as a publication. Include all of this information in a report comparing the three magazines.

Fine Arts- Design a line of clothing based on Atoosa Rubenstein’s style. Sketch at least four outfits included in the line, as well as accessories, such as hats and shoes. Reading some of her editorial comments in CosmoGirl may give you more ideas about her fashion likes and dislikes.

Journalism- Many people leave lucrative and respectable professions in their home countries for various reasons, such as to escape oppression or make a better life for their children. Interview recent immigrants in your community to find out why they moved, and what they gave up. Write a feature article for your school or local newspaper based on their stories.

Social Studies- Stage a class debate on the value of teen magazines. Some issues to consider: Do they promote positive self-image in teens? Is it their responsibility to encourage positive values and morals? Do they? Do advertisements unfairly target audiences who have little if none of their own money to spend?
