WHEN the National Sports, Vacation and Travel Show closes its doors a the Coliseum, tonight, the work on next year's show will have already been well under way.

Apparently the experience of having a show in New York for the first time under his management gave H. Werner Buck much to think about, and he has made the first move in planning for the future—the first national tour of the Sportsmen's Vacation and Travel Show.

“The new Sportsmen's Show,” he said, “will eliminate all conflicting dates between cities, thereby greatly simplifying the booking arrangements for the individual exhibitor.”

He has booked major ex‐ positions in five key cities across the country in 1965. New York will become the kick‐off city, with the show opening here on Feb. 19 for 10 days. Then it will move to McCormick Place in Chicago from March 6 through 14 and on to the Milwaukee Auditorium from March 20 through 28.
