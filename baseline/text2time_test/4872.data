TINKA TOPPING'S dream of academic paradise stands in a potato field in Bridgehampton. "When my children were young, I envisioned them attending a country school," Ms. Topping said. "The school bus would pick them up every morning, and they would drive off to paradise."

Because the schools near where the Toppings lived in Sagaponack were not quite the educational Edens Ms. Topping had in mind, she and other East End parents founded their own school, the Hampton Day School. It was 1966, and in the Age of Aquarius everything seemed possible.

The parents took over a farmhouse and a barn and started an alternative school. Twenty-five years later it still exists. But with the exception of Ms. Topping, who recently rejoined the Hampton Day board, little remains the same in the private school world of the Hamptons.

Truman Capote, an original supporter of Hampton Day, is no longer around to champion its cause. In the 70's fiscal problems caused the high school portion to close. And in 1987 a group of teachers and parents splintered off and created the Waterfront School in Sag Harbor. The defectors, as one Hampton Day parent calls them, took up residence in a building overlooking Sag Harbor's harbor.
