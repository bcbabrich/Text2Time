Press the first button on the private telephone at Gracie Mansion and you'll automatically be connected with a special woman in Mayor Koch's life. ''I have very special access,'' she said. Nearly every day at 6 A.M., the Mayor picks her up for a 40-minute workout on a treadmills in a downtown gym. He dines at her apartment almost weekly. She is an unsalaried member of mayoral commissions on the Status of Women and on the Year 2000. She is a sounding board and a source whose complaint about pickpocketing led to creation of a special police squad that arrested more than two dozen suspects on the Madison Avenue bus. Her tip about tony stores that help customers avoid sales taxes, a scam confided to her by a friend, has already raised more than $12 million in penalties and back taxes for the city.

''I'm a concerned citizen,'' she said, ''and, boy, do I get action.''

The Mayor is her mentor. He is also her brother.

If Mr. Koch sometimes acts spoiled, it's not because he was an only child.

Edward I. Koch, 63 years old, is eight years older than his sister, Pat Koch Thaler, the dean of New York University's School of Continuing Education, who lives on the Upper East Side with her husband, Alvin, a producer and director for CBS News. They have three grown sons.

The Mayor is four years younger than his brother, Harold, a successful carpet manufacturer, importer and designer (who is No. 2 on the automatic dialer). He and his wife, Gail, an executive recruiter who also runs another company, New York to Go, which caters to tourists who can't leave town without a nosh, live with their 11-year-old daughter on the Upper East Side.
