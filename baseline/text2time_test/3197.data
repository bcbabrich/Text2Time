But Darrell Nixon, 43, said he welcomed the renewed attention to the homicides.

''Justice should be done,'' Mr. Nixon said. ''It'll put people at ease. Regardless of the outcome, we need to put this to rest so people can begin to forgive and forget.''

For years, a portrait of Officer Schaad, with his blond cowlick, has hung in the police station here. His father was a police officer, and he had been on the job only 10 months when he became the only York policeman ever killed in the line of duty. He died at 22, two weeks after he was shot.

Charged with his murder on Tuesday were two men with long criminal histories: Donald Freeland, 49, who is in state prison on a drug conviction, and Leon Wright, 53. According to an affidavit, witnesses told the grand jury that Mr. Freeland boasted about firing a steel-piercing .30-.40 Krag rifle at the armored van in which Officer Schaad was riding. A preliminary hearing has been set for Nov. 9.

Mayor Robertson, who decided not to seek re-election earlier this year, admits that he was a racist police officer in 1969 and that he yelled ''White power!'' at a rally the night before Ms. Allen was killed. But he has denied any involvement in her death, which occurred by shotgun blast after a large group of white men surrounded her family's car.

Four prosecutors and four detectives spent two years trying to solve the Allen and Schaad cases. Because there was distrust among blacks, prosecutors said they first tried to solve the Allen case, hoping that witnesses would then come forward to identify Officer Schaad's killer.

Why did witnesses cooperate now? ''Time, guilt,'' said Bill Graff, York County's chief deputy prosecutor. ''When things happened 30 years ago, most just lied then. We're talking 17- , 18- , 19-year-old kids. Time moves on. They're in their 50's now.

''They know what they saw; they know what they did. Guilt has a lot to do with it. There have been eight suicides in these cases over 30 years. A lot of drug and alcohol problems. That's a heavy guilt to carry.''
