President Boris N. Yeltsin failed again today to make any public appearances, fueling deepening concern over his health just three days before the presidential runoff election.

Mr. Yeltsin, who is 65 and has a long history of health problems, has not been seen in public since Wednesday. He missed his last major chance to campaign today, when he did not appear at a large party sponsored by a Moscow newspaper to which he had been invited. By law, campaigning must stop on Monday.

Mr. Yeltsin traveled from his country home outside the capital on Saturday for a short working day in the Kremlin. Television news programs showed him smiling but looking weary and weak.

His Communist opponent, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, has seized on his virtual disappearance from view to remind voters how frail Mr. Yeltsin, who has had two serious episodes of heart disease in the last year, often seems.
