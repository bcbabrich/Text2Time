Forty-five years ago, when he was 15 years old, Byron Janis made his first impression on the musical world, playing Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto with the NBC Symphony. Five years later, by then a protege of Vladimir Horowitz, the young pianist made his recital debut at Carnegie Hall and embarked on a career that has been a long roller-coaster ride of exhilarating ups and sickening downs. The recital he gave at Alice Tully Hall on Tuesday evening, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Carnegie event, must rank as one of the decided ups.

Mr. Janis retired from public performance in the 1960's owing to illness, but returned to the stage in 1972. A year later, he was stricken with arthritis, which affected his wrists and left his fingers fingers swollen and painful. For years he played concerts and recitals under that physical handicap, often receiving blunt treatment from reviewers. Since 1985, when his ailment was diagnosed as psoriatic arthritis, his career has been on the rise once again, evidently thanks to new medical treatment. Two months ago he returned to Moscow for a concert, reprising a celebrated 1960 tour. In recent years, he has been especially active in fund-raising events for the Arthritis Foundation.

Remarkably often in his all-Chopin program, Mr. Janis reminded this listener forcibly of the dazzingly facile and arrestingly individual young pianist he first heard more than 30 years ago. Technically the 60-year-old musician may be a bit the worse for his experiences, but he is no invalid. Still spectrally thin if not quite so quiveringly intense as in the dim past, he tended to play as in the past, in brilliant lunges and bursts, relaxing only as if to build up energy for the next attack. The Valse Brillante in A-flat (Op. 34, No. 1) was, typically, deeply inward at one moment, a fireworks display the next. To those who believe there is only one way to play Chopin, in great arches and unbroken lines, such fluctuations might seem intolerably eccentric. In fact, they represented that current rarity, a mature artist's personality mirrored in an infinitely various masterpiece.

In the Sonata in B minor (Op. 58), the headlong tempo of the Presto finale pushed the pianist's fingers to the limit, and sometimes beyond. But on the whole, this was fluent Chopin playing with its own appeal. Mr. Janis, as in his youth, did not spin out long Bellini-like phrases but played out Chopin's dramas in taut scenes, as if in search of the opera itself, not merely the arias. Three Mazurkas were approached in the characteristic Janis style: full of rhythmic quirks, precipitous tempo shifts and febrile tension. The idiom's dance origins were obscured in favor of something darker and phantasmorgic, comparable to Ravel's evocative distortions in ''La Valse.''
