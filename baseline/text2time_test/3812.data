Mexico today dismantled its main anti-drug force, which was disgraced in February when its director and many of its agents were discovered to be working for traffickers, and announced that it had been replaced by a new organization to be built from a small nucleus of trusted agents.

The new agency will be headed by its current chief, and the 1,100 officers who worked for the old agency will be eligible, alongside new people, to apply for work in the reconstituted force.

But all of these applicants will be put through a battery of drug, polygraph and other tests to certify their trustworthiness before they are hired, Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar said. Such screening of agents is new.

The new agency, to be known as the Special Prosecutor's Office for Attention to Drug Crimes, will occupy the same downtown Mexico City headquarters as the organization it will replace, which was known as the Institute for Combating Drugs.
