At 40, Mr. Allen commented on some favorite subjects, including love and death.

Love: “On bisexuality: It immediately doubles your chances for date on Saturday night.”

“Love is the answer. But while you're waiting for the answer, sex raises some pretty good questions.” “I think sex should be confined to one's lifetime.”

Psychoanalysis: “When I first started going, I was worried my personality would be changed to conform to a norm representing a typical middle class Viennese of 1920. Now I'd be willing to settle for that.”

“It's hard to feel confidence in an analyst who doesn't wear a belt, shoelaces or a tie.”

Religion: “I knew I had problems years ago when they asked me what my religion was and I said, ‘Jewish with an explanation.’”
