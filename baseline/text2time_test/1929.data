Senator John McCain raised $47 million in August, more than double his previous best fund-raising month, driven in large part by $10 million in contributions that have come in since he named Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin his running mate on Friday, campaign officials said.

The Republican National Committee, which can also spend money on behalf of the McCain-Palin campaign, collected another $22 million, slightly less than what it raised in July, officials said.

By way of comparison, the McCain campaign raised just $27 million in July, its best previous month.



The August total for the campaign, however, comes close to the $51 million Senator Barack Obama raised in July.

After the Republican national convention close, the McCain-Palin campaign will get an infusion of $84 million from the U.S. Treasury as part of public financing.

The campaign will be prohibited from raising any additional money for the general election after it accepts the public financing, but McCain-Palin fund-raisers hope to collect another $100 million over the next two months for the R.N.C. A portion of that can be used in a coordinated manner with the campaign, but the rest can be utilized for independent expenditures.
