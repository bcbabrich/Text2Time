The real challenge is not to produce books, it is to achieve all the goals of publishing -- to get the books edited, distributed, noticed and, above all, bought. That is no easy feat: in the United States, 150,000-160,000 new titles were published last year, according to R.R. Bowker's Books in Print. On average, the P.O.D. titles sell just 150 to 175 copies, the companies say. Many authors are happy to pay for 50 or 100 copies of their magnum opus to give or sell to family, friends and business contacts. Others, though, confuse production with publication and end up disillusioned.

To address that problem, all three companies emphasize marketing, promotion and publicity options, either bundled into the packages or sold separately as add-ons.

The majority of sales of self-published books occurs online. According to Susan Driscoll, iUniverse chief executive, 40 percent are sold directly to authors and the other 60 percent move through retail channels. John Feldcamp, the chief executive of Xlibris, like his colleagues, maintains that book sales ''are colossally important; they are more profitable than the services.'' But the add-ons generate cash and pull in authors.

At iUniverse, the ''Star'' program is another important hook. If a title sells more than 500 copies its first year, the company may invest in marketing the book and invite the author to become a Star.

But of iUniverse's 17,000 published titles, the authors of only 84 have been chosen as Stars, and only a half-dozen have made it to Barnes & Noble store shelves.

An exceptional seller is a book like ''The Sweater Letter,'' a true-crime story from iUniverse, which has sold about 10,000 copies. Its author, Dave Distel, who worked for The Los Angeles Times for 23 years, said he ''didn't want to go through the song and dance'' of finding an agent and publisher. But he said he was ''unaware of the stigma'' associated with self-publishing and did not understand that booksellers expect discounts and also expect to return unsold copies. iUniverse worked with him, and Mr. Distel said he was satisfied.

The fundamental difference between P.O.D. publishers and old-style vanity and subsidy presses is cost. Traditional vanity houses like the 55-year-old Vantage Press charge on average $8,000 to $10,000 -- and sometimes as much as $50,000 -- to produce copies that an author then owns. Subsidy publishers own the copies, but give the author a ''royalty,'' actually a rebate, for each one sold.
