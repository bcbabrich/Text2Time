''I beg, I ask, I don't care,'' said Sister Thomasina. ''I say: 'Give me clothes. Not for me, for my patients.' ''

The sisters find their patients all over the big hospital building in lower Manhattan. A nurse will call to tell them that she has someone being discharged who, quite simply, has nothing to wear. Some had their clothes cut off when they reached the emergency room with a bullet or knife wound; others had their clothes burned because the creases were filled with lice.

Some wore garments that were returning to threads and lint, shoes that had not had soles for weeks, coats without sleeves or linings. Many of the nuns' patients are men, eyes rheumy, faces years older than their years, who have been admitted to the alcohol detoxification program. Some are women who have come to the emergency room, feet so swollen and creased that they look like elephant feet.

For those women, Sister Matilda will go down to the discount stores on 14th Street and buy a pair of slippers in some gargantuan size. For the others, she and Sister Thomasina will take measurements with their yellow-gold ribbon tape measures and then return to their storeroom, there to put together the right thing: the blue corduroy pants with the blue and red plaid shirt, the gray sweater with the gray pants and black shoes.

It seems never to have occurred to either nun that it is possible to send people who sleep in doorways and drink all day out into the world with clothes that do not match or do not fit.

It seems not to concern them to know that some of those who return to the hospital with tattered garments in need of burning will be wearing the same clothes the sisters mended and fitted on them months before.

''The young girls and boys, we try to give them something a little fancy,'' said Sister Matilda sadly. ''They should look nice. I dress a nice girl the other day, she say, 'Sister, I can't go out, I have no clothes, these are all dirty and holes.' I got her the blouse, the slacks. Beautiful.''
