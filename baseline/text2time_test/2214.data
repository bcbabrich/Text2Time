Bill O’Reilly is on the warpath again, accusing me of writing about Darfur as a career-advancement tool, and saying that Iraq and Darfur are all the same — if you support intervention for one, then you should support it for the other.

I won’t address the notion that I wade into war zones for self-advancement, except to say that during World War II my newspaper blew coverage of the Holocaust. The Times published 24,000 articles on our front page, and of those only six referred directly on the front page part to Nazi attacks on Jews. We blew it then, and I don’t want to make the same mistake in this genocide.

Then there’s the issue of Iraq. It’s true that in earlier periods, such as the 1980’s, Iraq had waged a genocidal campaign against Kurds — and that would have been an argument for military intervention. And in fact there eventually was belated military intervention, in the form of no-fly zones that we enforced in Kurdistan, barring Saddam from entering Kurdish areas. I do think that when a genocide is underway, there should be some kind of intervention.

But that doesn’t mean American intervention. I don’t want to see U.S. troops go into Darfur, any more than I want to see U.S. troops in Iraq. I was against the US invasion of Iraq for many reasons, but one of them was the way that would inflame Arab nationalism; for the same reason, I think it would be a mistake to send American ground troops into Darfur. But a genocide is currently underway in Darfur, in a way that it certainly was not in Iraq in 2003, and that does call for international intervention. That’s why I’d like to see a U.N. force with some Nato contingent and a large number of Muslim troops from Turkey, Morocco, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

Moreover, the biggest difference is this: Ordinary Iraqis didn’t want US troops to invade in 2003. Ordinary Darfuris are begging foreign troops to come in today. And in any case, it won’t be an invasion, because there’ll be enough international pressure on Sudan that it will, at the last minute, grudgingly accept the international presence.

So, Bill, you understand the distinction? If not, then come with me to Darfur. Take me up on my invitation. Times readers sponsored your visit, raising $700,000 for you to visit Darfur and see genocide for yourself. And once you’ve seen the dead kids and raped women, you won’t have to fulminate against me; you’ll have a much more worthy target to rant against, something entirely appropriate for your rage.
