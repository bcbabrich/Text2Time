The chairman and two other senior directors of Ultramar P.L.C. in London resigned yesterday in what analysts saw as part of a desperate attempt by the British oil and gas company to fight off a takeover bid by Lasmo P.L.C., a British oil and gas exploration and production company.

Lasmo has bid $2.26 billion for Ultramar, based on its price yesterday on the London International Stock Exchange. The shares fell 12.2 cents, to $5.546.

Lasmo argues that Ultramar is an ill-fitting collection of businesses and has lacked the management focus and financial resources to run its operations effectively. Lasmo plans to keep Ultramar's exploration and production operations in the North Sea and Indonesia, and sell its shipping, refining and marketing operations, in California and Eastern Canada.

Analysts generally agree and say Ultramar's stock price and earnings have been disappointing for about five years. Ultramar lost $35 million on sales of $1.44 billion in the first six months. Its stock closed in London at $5.999, up 1.7 cents.
