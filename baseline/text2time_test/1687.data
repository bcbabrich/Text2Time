The Dallas Symphony Orchestra said that it was postponing a tour of Europe planned for early next year, citing the downturn in the economy. In a news release, the orchestra said that it would put off until 2012 a nine-city European tour that was scheduled to run from Feb. 27, 2010, through March 11, 2010. The orchestra said that ticket sales for its 2008-2009 season had been strong but that its endowment and donations had suffered as the economy has declined. “The responsible thing to do is to postpone the tour,” Douglas Adams, the orchestra’s president, said in a statement. The orchestra said it still planned to perform at Carnegie Hall in May 2011, for its first performances there under its musical director Jaap van Zweden.
