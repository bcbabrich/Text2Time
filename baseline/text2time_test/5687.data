Five investigations into the conduct of the New York City Medical Examiner's Office under the Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. Elliot M. Gross, are under way. Dr. Gross has said he expected to be ''completely vindicated'' by the investigations.

The inquiries are these:

- A Federal investigation, ordered yesterday by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. A Federal grand jury is to examine ''possible obstruction of justice'' by the Medical Examiner in cases involving the deaths of people in police custody, including those of Eleanor Bumpurs and Michael Stewart. This inquiry could lead directly to a criminal indictment. Mr. Giuliani said obstruction of justice could have occurred if ''false information was supplied by anybody'' to authorities who investigated the deaths.

- A state investigation, ordered Monday by Governor Cuomo. It is to be conducted by Dr. David Axelrod, the State Health Commissioner, and Lawrence T. Kurlander, the Criminal Justice Coordinator. It is to examine allegations in The New York Times that Dr. Gross produced misleading and inaccurate autopsy reports on people, some of whom had died while in police custody. The inquiry is to review the operations of Dr. Gross's office and determine, within 30 days, ''whether any actions by employees of that office may constitute grounds for initiating charges of misconduct.'' A finding of misconduct could lead to criminal charges or to charges by the state's Board of Professional Medical Conduct, which regulates medical practice.

- An investigation ordered Monday by the State Attorney General, Robert Abrams. Mr. Abrams asked Thomas A. Duffy Jr., the state's special prosecutor for corruption in the New York City criminal-justice system, to look into the allegations against Dr. Gross to determine whether criminal charges were warranted. This inquiry also could lead directly to criminal charges. If Mr. Duffy found that such charges were warranted, he would present them to a grand jury.

- An independent city investigation by two Manhattan lawyers. They were named by Mayor Koch on Tuesday as special counsel to look into ''all allegations of impropriety, including specifically any which involve the police.'' The lawyers, Arthur L. Liman and Max Gitter, both of the firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, will have subpoena power and a staff that includes two pathologists. A report from them is expected in 60 days.

- Another city investigation by three officials named by Mayor Koch: Health Commissioner David J. Sencer; Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr., the corporation counsel, and a mayoral aide, Victor E. Botnick. They are to review the procedures and morale of the Medical Examiner's Office.
