The Chief also earned the enmity of many officers by ejecting them from desk jobs to street duty. Some quit. A One-Man Operation The Chief Meets In the Shadows

In the spring of 1990, the Chief began an unusual operation of his own, one that would arouse the curiosity of a department lawyer and the Connecticut state police but was never made public. He rented rooms at the Holiday Inn in nearby Milford and met there with someone he later described as an informant on Mafia activities.

At the same time, he said last week, he used other rooms at the motel for personal purposes, putting up friends at a special rate he was granted and using the swimming pool, sometimes with his granddaughter.

According to bills reviewed by The New York Times, the informant operation cost the department thousands of dollars. The Chief said he never told anyone whom he was meeting with -- he gave conflicting descriptions of the person -- and never stayed overnight. He saved no notes or other record of the meetings but, he said last week, passed on to his aides information that became the basis of a continuing undercover operation into mob control of several small New Haven businesses. That operation produced several drug buys and would lead to arrests, the Chief said. But Assistant Chief Esserman said in a separate interview that the operation had been of little value and should be shut down.

An inquiry into the motel expenses began last fall after a lawyer for the Police Department was shown some of the bills by a disaffected police major, Thomas P. Muller, who questioned whether the chief was using the rooms for personal reasons. The lawyer, Glenn Coe, a former state prosecutor now in private practice in Hartford, was concerned enough to pass the matter on to the state police.

Bernard Sullivan, who was then State Police Superintendent, said recently that at a meeting in his office last November, he was told in general terms by the New Haven State's Attorney that Chief Pastore was engaged in a law-enforcement operation and so, before starting an investigation, dropped the matter with the questions unresolved. The New Haven prosecutor, Michael Dearington, declined to comment on the matter last week, and it remains unclear what he knew of Chief Pastore's use of the rooms.

If some officers question the wisdom of a police chief meeting on his own with mob informants, Chief Pastore has no qualms. He boasts he had 108 informants when he was detective commander years ago.
