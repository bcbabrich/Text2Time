How do you raise money when your institution has been made much poorer by an ongoing sex scandal — like, say, the Catholic Church? You sell off your valuable but obsolete property.

And whom do you sell it to? Well, to people you really like. And maybe at a bargain price.

The National Catholic Reporter is running a cover story on the sale of church property to the Follieri Group, an investment concern with purported ties to the Vatican.

“They don’t want to compete,” said a real estate professional who dealt with the firm on a multiple-property offering in a Midwestern archdiocese. In this case, said the professional, the Follieri Group attempted to short-circuit the established procedures by ignoring the brokers hired by the diocese and making its offer directly to the church for the multiple properties.

The accompanying editorial calls for accountability when it comes to the church’s business practices.

Bonus: There’s a celebrity angle heating up this tale.

Thanks to his relationship with burgeoning Hollywood star Anne Hathaway (the princess of “The Princess Diaries” and most recently Lureen in “Brokeback Mountain”), Raffaello Follieri is more likely to be featured in New York’s tabloid newspaper gossip pages or paparazzi-like Web sites than on the financial pages.
