There are moments in art history when astonishing bursts of creativity seem to explode over a city or small region, producing a stream of masterpieces that change the way humanity understands itself and the world. It happened in Florence during the Renaissance, in the Netherlands during the 17th century, in Moscow around the time of the 1917 revolution and in New York during the 1940's and 50's.

To be an art collector at such a time, to understand the importance of the moment and have the means to grasp it, is a rare privilege. Two exhibitions at museums in Texas are tributes to such collectors.

Both Paul Guillaume and Jacques Gelman were born in Europe within a decade of 1900, but history and fate dealt them very different hands. They made their careers on opposite sides of the Atlantic. Neither was formally trained in art or art history, yet both took advantage of wealth, influence and unerring artistic sensibility to build magnificent collections whose cultural value continues to increase.

Guillaume promoted the art made around Paris during his epoch, which ranks among the finest and most influential ever. The 81 works selected from his collection, at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, include 16 by Renoir, 14 by Cezanne and others by artists including Monet, Picasso, Modigliani, Rousseau and Utrillo.
