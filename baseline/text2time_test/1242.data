What upper-middle-class suburbanite wouldn’t be apoplectic to find his newly sodded front lawn torn up by raccoons? In “The Details,” Jacob Aaron Estes’s surreal moral fable cloaked as a romantic comedy, getting rid of those pesky creatures becomes the obsession of Jeff Lang (Tobey Maguire), a smug, mild-mannered Seattle physician accustomed to getting his way.

These hollow-eyed scavengers so haunt his imagination that even when they’re not present, he glimpses them out of the corner of his eye. As the story darkens, the animals become synonymous with a gnawing guilt and fear that Jeff can’t shake off. And in one nightmare vision glowering raccoons overrun his bathroom and bedroom.

Jeff’s once passionate marriage to Nealy (Elizabeth Banks), with whom he has a son, has settled into a sexless, humdrum routine punctuated by fights in which they both scream at the same time. Besides laying traps to kill the invading critters, his distractions include flirting with prostitutes online and planning an addition to his house that flouts the local building code.

As Jeff blithely misbehaves, he is portrayed as a prototypical American Everyman in a society where it is O.K., perhaps even expected, for the well-heeled to bend the rules to suit their convenience and, as penance, to pay a little extra. When meeting resistance, instead of backing down, they just reach into their wallets.

Jeff is not without self-awareness. Late in the movie, he confesses to Nealy that he cheated his way through medical school. If Jeff, with his boyish, wide-eyed stare and blank expression, personifies a spoiled contemporary man-child, Mr. Maguire makes this essentially disagreeable character almost sympathetic.
