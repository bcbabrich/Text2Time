JACOBSONJanet C.,age 57, peacefully, on January 23rd. Loving wife, daughter, sister, aunt, stepmother, grand-stepmother, and friend to legions. A multi-lingual expert in international film finance known for her keen trend spotting, negotiation skills, irreverence, wit, style, and indomitable spirit, beating the odds with a rare form of cancer that ultimately claimed her life. She never let her illness define her; rather she used it to transform her life and live it to the fullest. She moved fast, enjoying novelty and challenge. Born in New York City and raised in Burlington Vermont and Westchester County, she graduated Cornell University (Phi Beta Kappa) and Columbia Law School (Harlan Stone Fiske Scholar). She began her career as an Assistant District Attorney in the New York County office of Robert Morgenthau, moving next to the law firm of Frankfurt, Garbus, Klein & Selz where she began her specialization in entertainment law. Subsequently she was in-house counsel at Balthazar Pictures, then Scala Productions Ltd., establishing herself in European film acquisition, development, and related activities involving parties such as Miramax and Canal Plus. The bulk of her career was spent at Hallmark Entertainment/RHI Entertainment structuring production finance, tax incentives and co-production arrangements and liaison work with producers, distributors and broadcasters in the television industry. During this period she pioneered film production finance in Hungary and other Eastern European countries. Ultimately she founded Film Borders, Inc., a legal and financial consulting firm for film and television clients. She is survived by her husband, James H. Wildman, former managing partner of the King & Spalding law firm and founding partner of its New York City office; her father and step-mother, Dr. Julius H. and Mrs. Joan L. Jacobson, her sisters, Jeannie, and Wendy (Andrew H. Miller), her brother, William (Beth R. Jacobson), nieces, Annalise and Sara, nephews, Max and Jackson Miller, step-sons, James Wildman, Jr. (Suby), and Andrew Wildman (Caroline), and step-grandchildren, Wake, Henry, Eli, Ellie, Hall, and Tate. Her mother, Beverly Jacobson, pre-deceased her in 2009, and her youngest brother, David, in 2003. Friends may call Tuesday, February 4 from 3-8pm at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st St. Funeral will be private with memorial service in the spring.
