This week we tried out Checchino, a restaurant that specializes in a uniquely Roman version of haute cuisine — dishes made with offal, or leftover animal parts: tongues, tails, intestines, livers, feet, those little fatty deposits in pig’s cheeks. Located (fittingly) at the bottom of a hill across from Rome’s old slaughterhouse, the 120 year old family run Checchino provides real Italian fare that (unlike pasta and chianti) has defied globalization.

I was determined to try it because Mario Batali, chef and owner of the extraordinary restaurant Babbo in New York City, says it is his “very favorite” restaurant in Rome. He recommends pajata, a dish where the intestine of a suckling calf is cut to look list penne pasta and served in tomato sauce.

Yes, it’s best if you like meat to eat here. What really shines (even for a lukewarm meat-eater like myself) are the meatiest dishes. The plate of cold salami was delicious and each tiny bit of bacon in the penne amatriciana tasted like an entire animal. The veal saltimbocca was topped by a piece of prosciutto that dwarfed the veal itself. Although the place has a few classic Italian vegetarian dishes — like soups of pasta and beans, or orzo and chicory, they were rather ordinary.

Sorry, I could not make myself try the tripe — but it did look really special. And atmosphere is part of the reason to visit Checchino, even if you shy away from the extreme eating that is its main offering. In a city now overrun with trendy pizzarias and wine bars, the dining areas inside and out have the feel of old Italia, elegant and eternal, where old friends discuss food and politics. The service is subdued, and the wine list excellent.
