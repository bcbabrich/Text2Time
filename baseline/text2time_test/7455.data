PARIS, May 31 â€” The Foreign Minister of France returned from Spain tonight confident that he had strengthened economic, military and cultural cooperation between the governments of President de Gaulle and Generalissimo Francisco Franco.

Maurice Couve de Murville, the French minister, had been in Madrid since Thursday as the guest of Fernando Maria Castiella y Maiz, Foreign Minister of Spain.

Qualified sources declared that no major agreements had been concluded during the visit. Its importance, they said, lay in the manner in which the two foreign ministers endorsed further cooperation between their countries.

The French Government is well aware that the hostility, of Britain, Norway and Denmark probably bars Spain's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
