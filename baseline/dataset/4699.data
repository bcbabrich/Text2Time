For Ben Feder, the Clinton campaign has been a bonanza. Mr. Feder is a pioneer Hudson Valley vintner. Since 1977, he has made a crisp, dry white wine from the seyval blanc grape. Mr. Feder's estate is in Clinton Corners, N.Y., and his label says Clinton Vineyards.

By late October, Mr. Feder usually has 700 cases of vintage-dated still wine in stock and 150 of nonvintage sparkling wine. But today his inventory has shrunk to 95 and 25, respectively. With the election approaching, Democrats, thirsty for more than the White House, have rung the winery's phone off the hook.

He could have sold every bottle during the Democratic Convention. But he kept some, just in case Clinton headquarters called from Little Rock. "If there's an inauguration, I'll need 750 to 1,000 cases, " he said. "I'm beating my brains out trying to figure out what to do."

Mr. Feder's 1991 vintage was the best since 1984. With one eye, he is watching his 1992 seyval evolve in tanks. With the other, he's watching the tightening polls, and wondering if the bubbles in the Democrats' champagne will go flat Tuesday night.
