Relying on an Unreliable Market

When the Pataki administration unveiled its deregulation plan in 1996, New York's utilities were producing more electricity than customers were using. The plan assumed that the surplus would last until 2005, if not longer, by which time market forces would have lured new power generating supplies to meet rising demand.

But the governor's proposal ignored a warning that New York was on the verge of rapidly losing its surplus due to increasing demand. A team at the Public Service Commission had forecast -- accurately, it turned out -- that New York would need new power plants by 2000.

''The feeling at the P.S.C. was, 'Yeah, that's true, but the market will respond,' '' said Lawrence DeWitt, who headed the team predicting trouble. ''It was consistent with the philosophy. It was the big leap.''

Now, though the demand is real, major new power plants remain years away. Power suppliers have proposed 21 large and mid-sized plants around the state, of which two have been approved. They will begin operating in late 2003, at the earliest, and neither is intended to serve New York City, where the need is most acute.

Other states years ago took steps to ensure extra supplies of power. Massachusetts, for example, streamlined the application process for building plants -- without softening environmental or other regulations; that is helping New England add enough plants this year to provide power to 2.6 million homes. Michigan, as part of its deregulation plan, has instructed utilities to find a way to increase transmission in the state by about 50 percent by June 2002.

New York, though, decided that its new power markets would be largely free of the state's hand. On taking office in 1995, Governor Pataki eliminated the state energy office, a planning body that he had derided during his campaign as a waste of money. From 1988 to 1999, no state agency had the authority to issue environmental permits for new power plants.

''Essentially there was a lot of rhetoric that the market would do the planning,'' said Carl Pechman, a former Public Service Commission supervisor and now head of Power Economics, a consulting firm. ''The feeling was, 'You don't need an agency to plan when you need a steel mill or new refinery, so you don't need an agency to plan when you need new power plants.' ''
