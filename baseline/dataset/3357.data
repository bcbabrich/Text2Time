The factories built as part of the great Soviet industrialization undertaken for Stalin, Georgia's native son, stand empty. The ugly concrete apartment houses for the workers are crumbling. The shops display few wares, and every traffic light is off to save electricity.

Only the soup kitchen seems to be thriving as a line snakes out the door.

Etery Guedashvili, 61, emerges from the squat building, carrying her ration of soup in a jar and bread wrapped in paper, a meager meal that embodies the dashed hopes for democracy and prosperity all across the former Soviet republics of the Caucasus and Central Asia.

At first she is embarrassed by this handout. But humiliation fast turns to anger, and she spits out her indictment of the government.

''I worked in a military production plant for 30 years and I earned a good pension,'' she said. ''Now I get only 12 lari a month, and they don't even pay that. I would go back to work, but there are no jobs.''
