It was not quite the homecoming they had intended. They were used to calling him Congressman Lazio. They had hoped to call him Senator Lazio. But when he showed up here tonight to address the monthly meeting of the Babylon Village Republic Club, he was just plain old Rick A. Lazio, citizen.

He may have been the local guy who almost made good, but he got a hero's welcome anyway when he returned for a night with the old political friends.

''It's great to be back,'' said a relaxed-looking Mr. Lazio, whose hair was a tad longer than it had been on the stump and whose voice had lost the trace of hoarseness it had toward the end of the campaign. ''It was a heck of a race, wasn't it?''

Mr. Lazio, who incessantly stressed his New York roots during the campaign in a none-too-subtle reminder that his opponent was an out-of-towner, grew up a few miles from here, in West Islip. Tonight, back from the debates, the bus tours in counties with unfamiliar names, the national press scrum, he was on home turf.
