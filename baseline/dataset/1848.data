Updated, 8:30 p.m. | Bertha, a sand tiger shark who had lived at the New York Aquarium since the 1960s and was believed to be one of the oldest sharks in any aquarium in the world, died on Saturday, the Wildlife Conservation Society announced on Tuesday. She was believed to be at least 43 years old.

“There was a lot of sadness,” said Hans Walters, a marine biologist who is the supervisor of sharks and the sea cliffs exhibit at the aquarium in Coney Island in southern Brooklyn. “It was a rough decision to have to lose this animal.”

Mr. Walters explained that as a last resort, the aquarium had euthanized Bertha. “She had been in declining health over the past month or so and we had started a series of treatments for her,” he said in a phone interview. “She seemed to rally a couple of weeks ago and was doing really well, but at the end of this past week, she showed another decline. We ended up restarting treatments again. When we realized they didn’t have any effect, we knew that it was time.”

The shark was put down around 4 p.m. on Saturday. A necropsy was performed on Sunday to determine the cause of the shark’s health problems; the results are pending.

Bertha lived with five other sand tiger sharks, two nurse sharks and a white tip reef shark in a round, 90,000-gallon tank. She was about 8½ feet long and weighed just under 250 pounds. She had no offspring; breeding sharks in captivity is difficult.

[Note: As several readers, including Lorne Loggia, have pointed out, an earlier version of this article included incorrect figures — supplied by the aquarium — for the dimensions of the tank in which the shark, Bertha, lived. This post will be updated again when aquarium officials supply the correct dimensions.]

The shark arrived in Brooklyn no later than 1965 — after she was captured by commercial fishermen off the East Coast and turned over to the aquarium — but the precise date is uncertain, Mr. Walters said. “We have hard-copy records of all our animals,” he explained. “It’s an old aquarium. Things have gotten misplaced and lost and gotten wet.”

A written record suggests that Bertha had been bitten by other sharks in 1974. The bite marks are a sign of mating activity, and sharks usually reach sexual maturity after age 6 or 7, which would be consistent with Bertha having been born in 1965. However, Mr. Walters said, a retired employee of the aquarium believes that the shark actually arrived as early as 1963.

No matter which year, Bertha was not only the largest of the aquarium’s dozen large sharks, but also one of the oldest sharks in any aquarium in the world, said Mr. Walters, who has worked with the sharks since 1992 and has conducted research on the care of sharks and on their migration patterns.

Surprisingly, it is hard to say how Bertha’s life span compared with that of other sharks from the same species. “Nobody knows,” Mr. Walters said. “You’d have to see it come out of the womb and follow as long as it lived. You’d be probably as surprised about how much is not known about sharks than about how much is known.”

The sand tiger shark is a large, coastal creature that dwells in subtropical and temperate regions. The sand tiger sharks are highly migratory, traveling as far south as the Carolinas and Florida during the cooler months. The shark eats small schooling fish and is not known to be aggressive toward humans (unlike the great white, the basis of the book and movie “Jaws”).
