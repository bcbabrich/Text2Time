PEERS--Judith Thelen. In loving memory of my beloved step-mother, Judith Thelen-Peers, she was our closest confidant and we cherished her. Those who knew her loved her. She brought so much joy to the world with her dancing career; an accomplishment few could claim. She will be truly missed by both the Thelen and Peers families and as we mourn our loss together, we take comfort in our wonderful memories of her. Peter S. Peers
