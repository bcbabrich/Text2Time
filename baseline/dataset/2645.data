"DAPHNE." It has taken more than six decades, but Strauss's late opera "Daphne," first presented in Dresden in 1938, finally has its first staged production in New York, courtesy of the adventurous New York City Opera and directed by Stephen Lawless. One reason this 90-minute work in one act remains a rarity may be its convoluted metaphysical story of a sensual and godly young woman, Daphne, who fearing mortal life and adult sexuality, yearns to be at one with nature. But the main reason the opera, despite its lushly harmonic score from Strauss's autumnal period, seldom turns up is the challenges it poses to the orchestra, the lead soprano and the two supporting tenors. Under the conductor George Manahan the City Opera orchestra acquitted itself admirably. The coloratura Elizabeth Futral had a triumph on opening night as Daphne, singing with great agility, full but never forced sound, touching vulnerability and stamina, and scampering about the stage like a nature girl. The tenor Roger Honeywell as the shepherd Leukippos fared better than the tenor Robert Chafin in the killer role of Apollo, who compete for Daphne's affections. The whimsically updated costumes were more effective than the pointlessly cumbersome abstract set. Overall, though, the presentation is a rare chance for New York operagoers to experience a great work. Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $32 to $105 (Anthony Tommasini).

"THE MAGIC FLUTE." The Amato Opera, now in its 57th season, stages its productions on modest but generally attractive sets, and uses reduced orchestrations and singers who can often be described as enthusiastic amateurs. But there is an evident devotion to opera and its composers in the company's work, as well as an intimacy that should well serve the symbolic world of Mozart's "Magic Flute," performed here in English. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m. The Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200. Tickets: $30, $25 for students and 65+ (Allan Kozinn).

"OTELLO." Opera buffs who are counting on Ben Heppner to be the Heldentenor of our time were understandably worried when he endured some vocal troubles in recent seasons. So his vocally splendid performance in the daunting title role of Verdi's "Otello" on the opening night of the Metropolitan Opera was something to cheer about. His clarion top notes and dusky-toned middle range singing easily soared over the orchestra, and he shaped Verdi's melodies with an elegant suppleness. He may have had opening-night jitters, though, for dramatically his work was tentative and he seemed too focused on his voice. The soprano Barbara Frittoli as Desdemona was not as much a support as she might have been. Her singing was sumptuous but a little bland. Carlo Guelfi's Iago was also a disappointment, vocally robust but dramatically stiff. For the most part James Levine's conducting had organic sweep, excitement and great nuance. Now that Mr. Heppner has proved to himself that he can nail this role vocally, he will surely take more emotional risks. The overall performance should gain confidence as the run continues. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $35 to $200 (Tommasini).

"PLATÉE." There is an element of meanness in Rameau's "Platée," the French baroque comédie-lyrique, which has returned to the New York City Opera in Mark Morris's enchanting production. Mr. Morris, who directed and choreographed the work, does not shy away from the cruelty in the story, which surely is just as Rameau intended. To teach his jealous wife Juno a lesson, Jupiter pretends to fall in love with Platée, a homely, part-amphibian marsh nymph who carries on like the grand dame of the swamp creatures. As costumed by Isaac Mizrahi, Platée may look ridiculous, with her frog skin, webbed feet and hands, and a sagging breast and tummy disguised by a sheer greenish gown. But as played by the diminutive and riveting tenor Jean-Paul Fouchécourt, Platée is an endearing diva. It's funny, yes, but heartbreaking to see her so blithely duped. The winning cast includes members of the Mark Morris Dance Group, wildly costumed as frogs, snakes, nymphs and such. Daniel Beckwith conducts. New York City Opera. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $32 to $115 (Tommasini).

"LA RONDINE." Puccini's seldom-heard opera "La Rondine" ("The Swallow"), long considered the composer's problem-child opera, gets a boost of confidence in a lovely production by the New York City Opera, a revival of a staging by the director Lotfi Mansouri from 1995. In "La Rondine," Puccini tries to capture some of the sensibilities of a Viennese operetta, so his typically emotive musical voice feels somewhat reined in. But the score, filled with Puccini's Italianate brand of Viennese waltzes and some wistfully beautiful melodies, wins you over. The soprano Pamela Armstrong gives a poignant and vocally rich portrayal of Magda, a courtesan in Paris who runs off to Nice with the smitten young Ruggero, but, fearing his rejection if he were to know the truth of her past, returns to her kept life. Gerard Powers brings boyish charm and a nice, warm lyric tenor voice to the role of Ruggero. Also winning are Tracey Welborn as the wry young poet Prunier and Angela Turner Wilson as Lisette, Magda's perky maid, whom Prunier adores. In his City Opera debut Stephen Lord conducts an undulant account of this undervalued work. Tonight at 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $27 to $105 (Tommasini).
