That direction is one that focuses on the bottom line and has increased income at the nation's oldest and largest book club in the last four years. It has revived a struggling institution with a careful blend of book offerings, marketing and customer service, according to officials at the company, which is a division of Time Warner Inc. But critics complain the club has lost its soul to marketing strategies that push best sellers instead of the best writing, brand-name authors instead of risky new novelists.

For a former club judge like Brad Leithauser, the ascension of a marketing executive to the No. 2 position was "a formal declaration that the principles of the institution have been abandoned, an institution that for better or worse had a very central place in national literary life." Mr. Leithauser added: "What it means is that the club has really become a mail-order house. For happenstance, they're selling books, but it could be kitchen supplies or clothes."

The steadily growing influence of the marketing department is a story not only of the Book-of-the-Month Club, but also of the entire publishing industry, where it has become common for sales directors to shift across the house to positions as editorial directors and publishers. The result is sometimes a blend of competing philosophies: a marketing search for blockbusters and name authors and a literary hunt for quality writing.

But it is a balance necessary to survive, according to George Artandi, the book club's president, a position that he continues to hold along with his recent appointment as president of Time Warner's Time-Life division.

"The Book-of-the-Month Club is a major cultural institution, and in order to remain that way it has to occupy a significant part of the public mind," he said. "It is essentially a mirror of the marketplace. When you have as many people as we do, it's not an elite business. We sell people what they want to buy. I don't know if the club has changed. If it has, it has changed along with the rest of the country and its institutions."
