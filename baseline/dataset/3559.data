BUSINESS travelers worldwide are increasingly embracing the Internet to research and book their flights, an annual survey by the International Air Transport Association has found.

Almost two-thirds of the survey's approximately 1,000 respondents from Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region said they used the Internet to find flight information, a 50 percent increase over the survey's results from two years ago. In some cases IATA compares the current results with year-earlier figures, in others with figures from 1997.

Not surprisingly, North American business travelers -- who made up approximately one-third of the group surveyed -- were the heaviest users of the Internet for flight research; 70 percent of this group said they went on-line to do research, an increase of 27 percent over 1997. Such use grew at an even greater rate among European travelers (an increase of 68 percent over 1997) and Asian travelers (an increase of 63 percent).

Over all, the number of travelers using the Internet to actually book a trip has almost doubled, from 9 percent in IATA's 1998 poll to 17 percent this year. One in 10 of those surveyed said they made flight reservations online weekly, one-fifth use the Internet monthly to book, while almost 40 percent make online bookings every few months.
