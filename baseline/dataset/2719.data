As it pursues a major acquisition in the United States, HSBC, Europe's biggest bank by market value, said Stephen Green, the 54-year-old head of its investment banking unit, would replace Sir Keith Whitson, 59, as chief executive. Mr. Green has been with the company for 21 years; Sir Keith will retire in May. HSBC is acquiring Household International, a United States consumer lending company. HSBC shares rose 1.4 percent to 684 pence. The announcement came just days before the bank is expected to announce a substantial 2002 profit. Alan Cowell (NYT)
