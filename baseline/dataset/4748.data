Deep down, dance is an art of exaltation, and "Lacrymosa," an astonishingly impressive premiere for the Joffrey Ballet by a 22-year-old novice choreographer, Edward Stierle, makes the case in the most compelling terms.

In fact, everything on the Joffrey's second program, on Wednesday night at the New York State Theater, suggested the planets had come together as an auspicious omen. No one interested in great dancing should miss Tina LeBlanc, arguably one of the world's best ballerinas in "L'Air d'Esprit." Gerald Arpino's eccentric pas de deux is transformed into poetic fantasy on this program by her precision and lilt, and yet without Mr. Arpino's cascade of little gemlike steps she would not dazzle so brilliantly.

Mr. Arpino's rock ballet, "Trinity" also looked full of energy on a big stage as a flower-power work for the 1990's. But the big surprise was how the 1932 "Cotillon," a "lost" work by George Balanchine, looked so at home for the first time in Balanchine's own State Theater.

Unmistakably, however, the shock of the evening came from "Lacrymosa," which uses recorded music from Mozart's Requiem and features another rising Joffrey star, Jodie Gates, dancing elegantly and exquisitely. With the other leads -- Tom Mossbrucker and Daniel Baudendistel -- the Joffrey offered a ballet of sweep and power by a major new talent.
