Japan adopted a cautious approach today to suggestions that it undertake a major aid program for the Middle East, as officials showed some embarrassment that fighting had ended with Parliament still debating an earlier pledge to aid the war effort.

In the last week or so, senior associates of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu have begun suggesting that Japan should lead the way to help create a new "Marshall Plan" for the Middle East, in part to mitigate its reputation for aloofness, which was reinforced because of its slowness in aiding the war effort.

But officials today rejected the idea that Japan would push for any such broad effort, suggesting that "we're not talking about big figures," as one put it. Instead, he said Japan would engage in low-key consultations with various countries and tailor aid programs for each of them. He said such proposals as one that Japan put up an extra $1 billion a year for the Middle East had no standing in the Government now. 'People Will Start Screaming'

Officials pledged emergency aid for Kuwait to get back on its feet but rejected the idea of long-term assistance, saying that "people will start screaming if we start grants to the richest country in the world."
