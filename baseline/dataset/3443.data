JOHN SKILTON'S BASEBALL LINKS: www.baseball-links.com -- The most complete list of baseball sites, indexed by subject.

ESPN.COM: espn.go.com/mlb/index.html -- Offers up-to-the minute scores and a healthy amount of statistics. One feature allows you to see how individual hitters do against certain pitchers and in particular ball parks. Transactions, however, are not always up to date.
