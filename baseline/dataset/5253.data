According to Ms. Glynn, sales of Tegison were less than $4 million last year, as against $50 million for Accutane. A supply that can last one person two weeks to a month can cost $45 to $70. Figures on how many people take the drug were not available, Ms. Glynn said. But she said that only a third of the people who take it are women and only one-third of those women are of childbearing age.

Ms. Glynn added that the company was seeking to determine whether to change its packaging to make the pregnancy warning much more prominent. ''Everything we do for Accutane is certainly applicable to Tegison,'' she said.

Not all the women whose babies were born with birth defects were taking the drug when they became pregnant, yet the drug was still in their bodies, Dr. Rosa said. A woman in Brazil became pregnant 11 months after she stopped taking Tegison and gave birth to a severely malformed baby, he said.

In West Germany, a woman stopped taking the drug four months before she became pregnant and then had a baby with major birth defects, according to Dr. Thomas Shepard of the University of Washington at Seattle.

According to Dr. Rosa, Tegison can be detected in patients' blood more than two years after they have stopped taking it. Strengthening the Warnings

Accutane was approved for marketing in 1982 for the treatment of severe cystic acne. F.D.A. epidemiologists at the hearing Tuesday estimated that as many as 9,180 American women had taken it while pregnant and that about 600 had had babies with severe malformations. Sixty-two malformed babies have been officially reported. Yet Hoffmann-La Roche and the F.D.A. had already warned doctors, pharmacists and patients that the drug must not be taken during pregnancy.

The advisory board endorsed suggestions by Hoffmann-La Roche to strengthen its warnings and recommended that the drug's distribution be restricted to make it harder for women to obtain it. For example, the board said, the women might be required to get prescriptions signed by a dermatologist and an obstetrician who would have instructed them on birth control.
