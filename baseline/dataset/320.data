VANCOUVER, British Columbia â€” It was past midnight when the Pittsburgh Penguins walked into the lobby of an upscale hotel in downtown Vancouver. On the fourth night of a recent trip, they had just flown from Edmonton, where they defeated the Oilers in an overtime shootout.

After veteran players like Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin grabbed their key cards and immediately retreated to their rooms, a group of entry-level players were left in suspense at the front desk.

They were waiting to find out their roommate assignments.

Usually there is a room list to peruse, according to goaltender Matt Murray, 22, who, despite having helped the team win the Stanley Cup last season, is still technically a rookie.

But Oskar Sundqvist, a 23-year-old center who was called up from Wilkes-Barre Scranton a day earlier, discovered his new roommate in a less conventional way.
