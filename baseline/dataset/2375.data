Three weeks into his new job as attorney general, Mr. Gonzales said Monday that he had to make "a few adjustments" in moving from President Bush's White House counsel to the official in charge of 110,000 employees at the Justice Department. A former enlisted man in the Air Force, Mr. Gonzales said one of the more unsettling changes was having employees call him by the title of "general," as they did with Mr. Ashcroft. (He prefers "Judge Gonzales," a nod to his days on the Texas Supreme Court.)

While Mr. Gonzales's confirmation as the first Hispanic attorney general buoyed many Hispanics, he showed no sign in his remarks on Monday of backing away from the Bush administration's efforts to speed deportation proceedings for illegal immigrants. Under Mr. Ashcroft, the Justice Department sought to streamline the process for immigration judges to hear appeals in deportation and asylum cases, and Mr. Gonzales said the system was in need of further repair.

He said that the Justice Department and federal courts were "straining under the weight of an immigration litigation system that is broken" and that illegal immigrants facing criminal charges were receiving too many chances to appeal their fates. He urged Congress to move quickly on proposals that would expedite the process.

But Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, suggested that Mr. Gonzales was misdirecting blame for the immigration backlog.

"If the attorney general wants to reduce the immigration workload of our federal courts," Mr. Leahy said, "he should restore the fair appeals process within the Justice Department that his predecessor diminished through his misguided restructuring of the Board of Immigration Appeals. That, and not depriving legal permanent residents of their due process rights, should be the solution."
