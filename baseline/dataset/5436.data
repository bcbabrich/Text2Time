He must have felt our eyes fixed firmly on his back, because every time he turned around, those same eyes attacked his chest. These were not the polite, furtive glances of shy-away women; these were visual kicks in the pants, table-banging glares from three children waiting for their birthday party to begin.

Eventually, it did begin, or rather it continued, complete with hot soup, frypan bread and hot coffee - and three desserts because, as in the rum-tippling times of Dylan Thomas's Auntie Hannah, birthdays like that came only once a year.

A few years ago, Mrs. Fisher and I exchanged birthday gifts on the 27th of June, extending the holiday further back than usual. She gave me a small wooden chest filled with coated almonds and wine vinegar made from fresh herbes de Provence steeped in good French white wine. I gave her a set of 60 petit four tins in five different patterns. Her reaction was underwhelming.

''Oh dear, more things to make,'' she said. Then she reassured me that she would use them and send along the results. A year later, however, when I opened her birthday gift to me, there were the tins, never used, untouched. I don't think she knew, or maybe she did.

In a sense, her most fascinating birthday story has not yet happened. I heard the start of it a few weeks ago as we sat outside on her porch under the postcard-blue sky of the Sonoma wine country. From her high-backed wicker chair, she pointed to the parched, flaxen field stretching like an endless tatami mat all the way to the black-green mountains in the distance. For 16 years, she explained, on her birthday, or very close to it, a huge barn owl flew across that field and landed on the telephone pole a few hundred yards from the porch.

''It was at least three feet high, and it must have had a nine-foot wingspan,'' she said. And it was definitely the same old owl, year after year.

Before her last birthday, some people came over with a sad story. ''They said they were sorry,'' she recalled, ''but they'd found the owl, or rather the skeleton of the owl, on the ground. A coyote had got him, they thought.'' Came her birthday, and she was sitting on the same porch, same chair, looking out across the yellow-white hay, when a much smaller owl -''Maybe the grandson,'' she ventured - alighted on the pole.
