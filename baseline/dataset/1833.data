There will be more soon on our pro football page, but the news is this: A day after beefing up their defensive line with the All-Pro Kris Jenkins, the Jets have signed the All-Pro guard Alan Faneca for the offensive side. Greg Bishop reports:

The Jets signed the free-agent guard Alan Faneca to the richest deal in team history Saturday. Faneca is due $40 million over five years, with $21 million guaranteed. His agent said the contract would make Faneca the highest paid lineman in N.F.L. history.

“The Jets are buying more than a left guard,” Faneca’s agent, Rick Smith, said. “His attitude is: Get on my back, and let’s go win a Super Bowl.”

It’ll take a strong back to lug around both a team and his wallet.
