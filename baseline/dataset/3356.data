DINNER with entertainment often used to mean dinner theater, but the days of dinner theater in Connecticut seem to have faded into yesteryear, along with veal cordon bleu and baked Alaska.

That doesn't mean you have to dine in silence or to a repertory of golden oldies played off-key on an out-of-tune piano. These days you can find some very hot live music and entertainment all around the state in both fancy and funky settings that also feature interesting food. Here are a few of some of the livelier spots, listed alphabetically by town.

Bridgeport

Downtown Cabaret Theater may be the last outpost of what used to be known as dinner theater -- with a twist. Maybe it has survived because of its novel approach to dining, called B.Y.O.D., Bring Your Own Dinner (and drinks). It works surprisingly well. Some patrons arrive with pizza and beer, others favor more elaborate menus and a few have gone so far as to bring their own tablecloths, china and silverware.

The drill, we found, was to arrive early (in order to get the choice seats, facing the stage, at our reserved table, which is shared with others) and unwrap and munch on our home-made sandwiches, pasta salad and cookies. While we opted for the casual, we noticed diners at another table with a large casserole, salad bowl, foil-wrapped warm rolls, meringue pie and 1920's-style cocktail shaker of martinis. Most tables seat 8, though there are a few for 2 and one for 10 diners. Soft drinks, tea and coffee are the only drinks sold on the premises.
