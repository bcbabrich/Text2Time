Some 600 Kennecott stockholders watched the proceedings in the Grand Ballroom while 150 others stood throughout the long meeting. In a nearby room, 500 more watched on closed‐circuit television, many of them also standing.

Security was extremely tight, with six uniformed guards and six in red blazers, some with two‐way radio sets, watching over the proceedings. Reporters were asked to wear identification badges and photographers were severely restricted once the meeting began. Sixty chairs had been reserved for the press close to the front of the main room while 85 more seemed certain enough that it would stand unchallenged — despite a CurtissWright appeal—that it had ordered the decision printed in time for the meeting.

Jumping to the platform, Mr. Berner, immediately followed by TV cameramen, shouted: “I must tell you, the action by Judge MacMahon was wholly unanticipated. [Kennecott's suit] was frivolous and trivial and meant only as harassment.”

The Curtiss‐Wright chief went on to explain the feasibility of his plans to run the copper company when Mr. Milliken interrupted him to say, “You asked for a 15‐minute recess.”

Stockholder shouts of “sit down” were heard.

The meeting resumed at 10:15, with Mr. Milliken reading from one of three prepared texts that had foreseen the possibility of the appeals court ruling.

“The court did not rule on the merits,” of the Kennecott suit against Curtiss- Wright, he said. “This meeting will proceed as if the injunction had not been issued.”

Reading with a firm voice, he outlined the problems of Kennecott in the past, asserted that Kennecott was “clearly better company today than we were last year” and said “I hope I can count all of you as friends whether or not you vote the management slate.”
