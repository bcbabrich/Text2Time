When Jose Santos won his third race of the day aboard Jane's Dilemma yesterday in the $90,150 Display Handicap, Aqueduct's year-end feature, he earned a spot in the national money winner's circle for 1987.

Santos, who concluded the year as New York's leading rider with 248 winners, rode horses that earned $12,369,593 in purse money for the year, and enabled him to edge Pat Day for the national title. Day did not ride yesterday.

Jane's Dilemma won by a neck in the two-and-one-quarter-mile Display Handicap for 3-year-olds and up. The victory was her 14th in 61 career starts.
