Seth Davis, a writer for Sports Illustrated and college basketball analyst for CBS, is the author of “When March Went Mad: The Game That Transformed Basketball.” It’s a look at the 1979 N.C.A.A. title game that featured Magic Johnson’s Michigan State team against Larry Bird’s Indiana State squad. In an e-mail interview, Davis discussed both players, the impact the game had on the sport and whether we will ever see anything like it again.

Magic vs. Bird is one of the most famous individual rivalries in sports history. When you started this book, were you worried that almost too much was known about them?

Not really, because I knew I was reporting on a time in their lives that was not well-known to the public. There was certainly much about them that I didn’t know before embarking on this project. For example, I had no idea just how close Larry Bird came to never playing college basketball. If Bill Hodges, who had just gotten hired as an assistant at Indiana State in the spring of 1975, hadn’t managed to gently coax Bird off a garbage truck and convince him to give college one more try, we would have never heard of Larry Bird. Likewise, I learned a lot about Magic’s childhood, specifically the fact that when he was a teenager he was bused to a mostly-white school with no basketball tradition. And of course, the story of that season had many fascinating twists and turns that I never knew about. Most of the people who watched the 1979 championship game were seeing these guys play for the first time, so the details about what brought them to that historic first meeting are not well-known even to most of their biggest fans.



You weren’t able to talk to Johnson or Bird. Are there questions that you would have liked to ask Johnson or Bird that you didn’t get a chance to?

I would like to have had the chance to try to get them to go beyond the sugar-coated, anodyne versions of what went on back then that they usually try to tell. It’s not that I would have trolled for controversy, but as a reporter you’re always trying to get closer to the truth. But those guys have been such open books – literally so, since they both wrote autobiographies and have had numerous books written about them, not to mention the hundreds of interviews they have given – that it’s unlikely they would have told me something fundamentally new. If anything, not talking to them liberated me so I could view them with a more of a reporter’s critical eye. Maybe if I had spent a lot of time of them I would have subconsciously tried to please them as I wrote.

The championship game itself was a little underwhelming. Bird had one of his worst games of the season and Michigan State was in control from the outset. Still, the audience for it was enormous. What was it about this game that drew so many people to it? Was it simply the personalities of the two stars? Would it be remembered so fondly if Magic and Bird didn’t become Magic and Bird?

It was, to coin a phrase, a perfect storm. First and foremost, people really understood that these guys were unique, and uniquely talented, players. They were big men, and they were making it cool to pass. Then you had the whole David-versus-Goliath thing. Indiana State was this little-known school from the Missouri Valley Conference with the mysterious farm boy, and yet somehow they made it all the way to the final game undefeated. Were they really that good? In a one-and-done scenario, that was extremely alluring. The fact that Bird was white and Magic was black added to the sexiness of the matchup, but the biggest reason there was such a huge audience was simply because there weren’t that many viewing options back then. Instead of 800 channels, there were only 4. As for them becoming Magic and Bird, that obviously would not have affected the 24.1 Nielsen rating they generated that night, but because of what they went on to accomplish, this is one of the rare instances when an event that was huge at the time it happened has only grown in significance as recedes further in the rearview mirror.

Can you talk a little bit about the news media coverage of the two players? While both received more than their share of praise (including each being featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated) they were also the focus of heavy criticism at times. For example, David Israel of The Chicago Tribune excoriated Bird for not talking to the press, and Bill Gleason of The Chicago Sun-Times called Johnson “a mediocre passer and ball handler.”

Well, it’s all relative, of course. The media coverage back then was only a fraction of what it would be today. But it’s amazing to think that Larry Bird, who in many ways was the biggest story in college basketball that season, went basically the entire year without talking to the press. Can you imagine a high-profile athlete pulling that off today – or even wanting to?

They both had their share of skeptics as to how well their skills would translate into the N.B.A., especially since they weren’t naturally gifted athletes. The main difference is that while Bird couldn’t stand dealing with the media, Magic absolutely relished in it, yet he did it in a way that somehow never alienated his teammates. With them, he was just a down-to-earth guy who treated everybody well. It speaks volumes about his personality and character that he was able to be a larger than life media icon (especially in Lansing), yet his teammates loved him. Maybe it has something to do with the number of easy buckets he got them!

Phil Martelli can take some solace in the fact that Billy Packer was not too impressed the first time he came across Bird and Indiana State. What sort of insight did Packer give you into the season, especially as someone who sort of became a lighting rod for Sycamores fans?

Yes, the more things change, the more they stay the same! One thing people don’t realize about Billy Packer is that not only is he willing to admit when he’s wrong, he actually enjoys being proven wrong. I will say that Billy never did quite get out of his mind-set that the only high-quality basketball is being played in major conferences. But a lot of people doubted whether Indiana State was for real that season. I really, really enjoyed talking to Billy about everything that happened, just like I always enjoy talking to him about college basketball history. He has a great memory, terrific insights and he always tells you what he thinks no matter the consequences.

This book deals with more than just Magic Johnson vs. Larry Bird, of course. Indiana State Coach Bill Hodges emerges as one of the more interesting characters, not least because of what happened with his coaching career after that title game. How much did you know about Hodges when you started and what’s your perspective on him now?

How much did I know? I didn’t even know the guy’s name. Seriously, even if you asked the most ardent college basketball fans the question of who was Bird’s coach in that game, I’ll bet almost none of them could tell you. And yet, as you said, he turned out to be probably the most interesting character in the book. Bill has really been through a lot, both good and bad. A lot of people in his situation would have emerged with bitterness and regret, but Bill has a great perspective on all that has happened. He is currently a high school history teacher in Roanoke, Va., and he genuinely enjoys his job, his life and spending time with his grandchildren.

I can understand why he was able to convince Larry to get off that garbage truck. I would have played for the guy, too, if he asked me.

A similar question about Jud Heathcote, who went on to have a successful career at Michigan State after Johnson left. He seems like quite the character.

For literary grist, it’s hard to imagine a better subject than Jud. He is smart, blunt and absolutely hilarious. It was interesting for me to go back to that time and learn more about what he was like, and what his players thought about him. Today we think of Heathcote as this hilarious old codger, but the reality is, his players really did not like him. They did, however, respect his basketball knowledge. They had a lot to sort through as a unit to make it to that title game. He had to give a little, which wasn’t easy for him, but at that stage in his life there was only so much he was going to change. He had a pretty bad health scare last summer, but it seems like he has come through O.K. and he’s as ornery as ever. God bless that man.

The outcome of this game clearly still gnaws at Bird. Without giving too much away, the closing scene shows him as still broken up about the outcome. Were you surprised by how much the game has stayed with both players, especially Bird?

That’s something that didn’t surprise me, because we all know what intense competitors those guys were. The reason it gnaws so much at Bird is because he knows it’s something he can never get back. When Magic won an N.B.A. title or an M.V.P. award, Larry could always say, “I’ll get mine next year.” But this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and only one of them could prevail.

And even though they’re great friends now, they’re still competitors, and Magic will always have the last word. I also think Larry’s regret stems largely from his affection for the community of Terre Haute. He knew how much this game meant to them, and he still feels like he let them down.

In this day and age, with wall-to-wall sports coverage on television and on the Internet, could we ever have a situation like this again?

Absolutely not. That’s what makes it such a great story to revisit. We still get great games and great individual matchups, but you have to remember, this game was literally the first time most people had seen these guys play.

Take, for example, what Bryant Gumbel said the night of the game when he hosted the pregame segment for NBC: “If you haven’t seen Larry Bird play, you’re in for a treat.” Think about it – in my current role for CBS, would it have ever occurred to me to say before last year’s championship game, “If you haven’t seen Derrick Rose play, you’re in for a treat”? There was an innocence back then, a delayed gratification that paid off eventually in spades. I love watching wall-to-wall basketball as much as anyone, but in a way it’s a shame that that element of the unknown is gone now. A little mystery goes a long way.
