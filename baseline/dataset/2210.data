Now, the question for Mr. Sanchez and his allies is what comes next. Mr. Sanchez pondered that and decided to continue to fan the flames, this week inviting to his program activists pushing for more demonstrations and a nationwide boycott on May 1 that would call on all Latino immigrants, legal or not, to skip work and avoid buying anything.

His guests on Friday morning included representatives from Hermandad Mexicana Nacional, an advocacy group hoping to turn out thousands of people on Saturday in Costa Mesa to protest plans by the police to help enforce immigration laws, a move organizers see as an affront to Latino immigrants there.

But Mr. Sanchez is trying to balance his inner demands with the expectations of his more than one million listeners who want a fun show, and that of outside advocates, who want more attention for one of the largest mobilizations of Latinos in years.

"I am not an activist," said Mr. Sanchez, 40, a legal resident from Veracruz, Mexico, who speaks no English but worked his way up to his own show here three years ago after working in radio in Tijuana, Mexico. "What I do is make jokes and make people laugh. This is the first time I have really done anything like this. But it is important for our community, and what the politicians are doing is not recognizing the work immigrants do."

Mr. Sanchez said he had not paid much attention to the immigration issue until meeting with demonstration organizers, who have focused on legislation passed by the House of Representatives last year that would, among other things, make it a felony to be in the United States without proper papers and a federal crime to aid illegal immigrants. A bill in the Senate would take a different tack, putting in place ways for illegal immigrants to gain citizenship.

Mr. Sanchez said it had not taken much to pique his interest.

He said he had felt the sting of racism in crude remarks from strangers in and around Los Angeles and in dirty looks from hotel staff members on trips to Las Vegas.

That, coupled with a sense of a big moment at hand, motivated him to meet with other radio-show hosts and disc jockeys, who agreed to urge their listeners to turn out for a March 25 demonstration in downtown Los Angeles.

The police said 500,000 people turned out, though organizers put the figure at more than a million.

The March 25 Coalition, the organization that coordinated the demonstration, sought to keep the Spanish-language news media engaged, urging them to promote the proposed May 1 boycott and other protests.

"That's when this thing really took off, when we got the Spanish radio and television on board with us," said Jesse Diaz, a sociology researcher at the University of California, Riverside, and one of the main organizers. "El Mandril and the others, they stepped up."

On Friday, Mr. Sanchez gave more than an hour of air time to Isabel Rodriguez, a civil-rights lawyer, who answered listeners' questions about truancy citations given to some students who missed class to attend marches.

"A student cannot be suspended or ticketed?" Mr. Sanchez asked.

Ms. Rodriguez responded, "The First Amendment protects the right of expression."

Shortly after thanking Ms. Rodriguez for her remarks, Mr. Sanchez adopted the effete manner of one of his radio personalities and engaged in racy banter with his comrades-in-morning-lunacy, the three crew members who hoot and cheer when it seems appropriate. Together, they call themselves "Los Guapos de la Ma√±ana," the Handsome Ones of the Morning.

"We call ourselves that because, look at us, none of us are," said Mr. Sanchez, squat and portly in a pink tropical shirt and jeans.

Then, perhaps the flip switched again, and Mr. Sanchez pointed to a laptop computer, and within seconds used it to display pictures of the big protest last weekend, beaming at a shot of himself at the front of the march wearing a white T-shirt with the slogan "Work and hope are not crimes," his arms interlocked with a state senator and rally organizer.

"Look at that," he said with a giggle. "All the other D.J.'s were like, how did you get up there?"
