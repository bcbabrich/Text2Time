Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz warned America's allies in Asia today to keep their guard up against terrorist activities within their borders, cautioning that even nations with large Muslim populations remain targets for attack by Islamic extremists.

''I still think the terrorism problem is felt as a little bit remote, as a little bit America's problem,'' Mr. Wolfowitz told reporters traveling with him to a three-day regional security conference here that ends on Sunday. ''It's not just America's problem. The targets also very explicitly include the 500 million Muslims who live in the Pacific Rim.''

Mr. Wolfowitz, a former ambassador to Indonesia, said he intended to use his stature as the highest-ranking Pentagon official to visit Southeast Asia since the Sept. 11 attacks to underscore that the Bush administration's long-term goals in the capaign against terror extended well beyond Afghanistan.

''Perhaps, they may not realize quite how committed the United States is or quite how long we expect this to take,'' Mr. Wolfowitz said, referring to Asian allies, a few hours before separate meetings with military officials from Indonesia, Singapore and India.
