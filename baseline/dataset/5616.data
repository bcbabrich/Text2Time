When the Equine Drug Testing Program at Cornell University reversed itself three weeks ago on the finding of a banned medication in a horse that had run fourth in the Breeders' Cup Turf last November, virtually everyone in New York racing was suddenly asking the same question: If a mistake had occurred in post-race testing of one of the year's premier events, could the testing done on tens of thousands of other races in the state annually be trusted?

The question speaks to the essence of public confidence in the sport. Some of the leading thoroughbred trainers of recent years, particularly those specializing in the lower-grade claiming races that make up the bulk of daily cards, emerged from obscurity with an uncanny knack for improving the performances of other trainers' castoffs. Horseplayers matter-of-factly refer to these trainers as ''chemists'' and ''juicers.''

The State Racing and Wagering Board is still investigating the recent incident, in which Lashkari was initially disqualified from the Breeders' Cup race after testing positive for Etorphine, small doses of which act as a stimulant, and was then reinstated when four other laboratories contradicted the finding. The board's inquiry has turned up irregularities in work done by technicians at the Cornell lab, which performs all initial tests on the first four finishers in New York races. One lab employee has resigned, and another has been reassigned.

But, while the investigation continues, the board's early sentiment suggests that the Lashkari case, far from undermining the lab's authority, will prove to be a rare kind of exception. ''We have not reached our final conclusions, and we're still evaluating our future relationship with the Cornell lab,'' says Richard Corbisiero, the board's chairman, who met with Cornell officials for five hours one day last week. ''But in all fairness to them I have to point out that they test about 230,000 samples of blood and urine each year, and this is the first time anything like this has happened. I think that speaks for itself.'' For his part, Dr. George Maylin, the lab's director, continues to stand by the finding that Lashkari was drugged, but says that the irregularities would have made a legal defense impossible. (Lashkari's owner and trainer dropped civil suits against the board when the disqualification was overturned last month.) ''We always have other laboratories confirm our findings,'' Maylin says, ''and this was the first time we have had a problem. In this case, a laboratory technician has admitted that he post-dated data, so there is question now about the rest of the work he did on this sample.''
