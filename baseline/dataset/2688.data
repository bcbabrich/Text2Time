Sweet and Hot

When the Long Island-born Frank Vignola (right) was 7, his father, a semiprofessional guitarist and banjo player, gave him a record album. On it was the music of the Belgian-born Gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt and his Parisian ensemble the Quintet of the Hot Club of France in the years from 1934 to 1939. Reinhardt, who died 50 years ago, is now legendary. Mr. Vignola is now a guitarist in his mid-30's. Stephen Holden of The New York Times calls him virtuosic. Legend and virtuosity come together on Jan. 8 and 9 at Sweet Rhythm (formerly Sweet Basil) in Greenwich Village, where Mr. Vignola will lead his quintet, Hot Club USAC in a celebration of Reinhardt and his equally famous jazz violinist, Stephane Grappelli. Performances are at 8 and 10 p.m. in the club, at 88 Seventh Avenue South, between Grove and Bleecker Streets.

In the Mood

Can't go to Vienna for the New Year's Day festivities? Well, in New York today the spirit of Vienna will be in evidence at Lincoln Center. At 2:30 p.m. ''Salute to Vienna,'' a re-creation of that city's celebration, will fill Avery Fisher Hall with arias and duets, polkas and waltzes by Josef and Johann Strauss Jr., Emmerich Kalman and Franz Lehar. Besides the music of the Strauss Symphony of America, conducted by Christian Schulz, the program features the soprano Milena Rudiferia, the tenor Jerry Hadley and members of the Hungarian National Ballet, dressed in traditional costume and dancing waltzes by Strauss.

Show Business

Does art imitate life? Or is it the other way around? Consider the events that are to take place this weekend in the culmination of the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Michigan Theater, the movie palace and vaudeville house in Ann Arbor. At 8 p.m. Saturday and at 2 and 7 p.m. Sunday, the theater, saved by the community from demolition some 20 years ago, will be the site of concert performances of the 1971 Stephen Sondheim musical, ''Follies,'' above. The show deals with a theater about to be torn down, an occasion that prompts a reunion party where old relationships and old wounds are revisited through the appearance of the youthful ghosts of the earlier selves of two couples. On Broadway in 1971, these younger selves were portrayed by Kurt Peterson, Harvey Evans, Virginia Sandifur and Marti Rolph. In Ann Arbor they will reunite as the older versions of their original roles. Joining them will be the Tony Award-winning Donna McKechnie, who will portray Carlotta Campion, who sings the show-business anthem ''I'm Still Here.''

Remembrance

On Jan. 20 the French Opera Ballet will commemorate the 10th anniversary of Rudolph Nureyev's death. Excerpts from his choreography and roles will be performed in a gala. Nureyev, who headed the company from 1983 to 1989, died in 1993 at 54.
