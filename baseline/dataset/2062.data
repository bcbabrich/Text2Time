The Washington Note has an interesting post saying that David Gordon, now the vice chairman of the National Intelligence Council, will be announced as the new head of Policy Planning at the State Department. That’s very interesting, because David Gordon is first rate and not ideological, and because Policy Planning is a key portfolio in any administration in developing long-range policy. Of course, hard-liners in the Office of the Vice President can still out-maneuver the sensible people, as they have for most of the last six years, but it’s nice to see good people appointed to top posts. Steve Clemons, who writes the Note, says that Gordon’s appointment is indicative of better people going into posts more recently, and maybe there’s some truth to that. If the administration had started with Bob Gates and Gordon England at the Pentagon, instead of Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz, with Zoellick at the World Bank — and, best of all, with somebody like Tom Ridge as vice president rather than Cheney — then Bush might have avoided a failed presidency. Bush also might have done better in preserving his reputation if he had just been defeated for reelection, so that his fans could blame today’s problems on John Kerry.
