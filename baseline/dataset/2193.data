Readers respond to Thomas Friedman’s Mar. 1 column, “Who’s Afraid of a Gas Tax?“

Sherm Gallay, Lee, N.Y.: Can you get a voting majority of Americans to make a deliberate sacrifice which directly affects their pocketbooks? I would like to hope so, but I don’t think so. Your pro-tax stump speech is compelling and accurate, but I don’t think it will have broad appeal.

You know, there is one easy, cost-free way to immediately reduce fuel consumption — enforce speed limits. A vehicle traveling at 65 miles per hour gets 10-20 more miles per gallon than one traveling at 75 m.p.h. In most states I’ve driven through, the cops will give you about 10 m.p.h. over the limit before giving a ticket.

Now if national leadership, were to request that the states strictly enforce the speed limits, but not change them, there would be a quick and lasting reduction in fuel consumption. Would the American people go along with this rather painless proposition? I wouldn’t bet on it. Of course, there would have to be real national leadership to even try it.

Tom Sandusky, Spring Hill, Fla.: You cannot just propose a huge gas tax. Most people live from paycheck to paycheck. It has to be an integrated approach. First, the government has to announce that a gas tax is going to be imposed, increasing a small amount per year until you get to a target year, in order to give people a chance to adjust. Second, along with the increase in gas taxes the government has to increase fuel efficiency standards to help offset the cost of higher taxes.

Sam Uretsky, Wantagh N.Y.: The importance of developing alternative energy sources can’t be overstated, but is a gasoline tax — ultimately a retrogressive tax — the best answer? People with the highest incomes could easily ignore it, and continue to drive Hummers. People with low incomes might be unable to afford to buy an alternative fuel vehicle, and be penalized. I’m uncertain whether any suitable alternative vehicles are currently available for handicapped conversion. Using tax policy as the prime mover of public policy simply seems like an inappropriate approach.

I don’t have an all-purpose solution, but a combination of inducements might help. Perhaps an initial tax break could be offered to corporate fleets using alternative fuels, along with specifications for alternative fuels to be used in government vehicles at all levels. As these cars enter the used car market, they would be more affordable for lower-income individuals, thus permitting a gasoline tax to operate in a more equitable manner. Conversion kits might be made available for cars now on the road to permit increased use of biodiesel and gasohol without the need to buy a new vehicle. Increased subsidies for mass transit would also be a plus.

It’s a national shame that we didn’t listen to President Carter when he developed an energy plan, but perhaps this time we’ll learn.

Michael Siteman, Agoura Hills, Calif.: I agree with you that, by raising the tax and therefore creating higher gasoline prices at the pump, we create a commercially feasible environment for proliferation of alternative fuels. My only concern regarding increasing the gasoline tax is that the government, especially the current administration, will squander the additional revenue.

Frank Auer, Stratford, Conn.: You seem to have little concern for the poor and middle classes that have to drive and can’t afford hybrid cars. I drive 60 miles a day for work, and others I know would really be hurt by a gas tax. How about a graduated tax on new cars based on mileage? Or putting those oil-company and rich-people tax cuts to use for research? Or eliminating the cuts and using the money for mass transportation improvements? It’s always the poor and middle classes who get stuck being the responsible citizens.

Mike Flanigan, Chevy Chase, Md.: I applaud your focus on raising the gas tax and on our energy policy in general. But I think you should take more care in what you propose as alternatives to imported oil. Today you promoted hybrids that run on biofuels such as ethanol. The last time I looked at the issue, a number of studies indicate that, if corn is the source of the ethanol, it takes more energy to produce a quantity of ethanol than we get out of the product. The other sources of biofuels are really in their infancy.

Oliver Patton, Alexandria, Va.: I have followed your campaign for higher fuel taxes with great interest. It’s an important idea that needs to be fully aired.

Two questions:

1. How do we know that $4 a gallon will, in fact, change consumer decision-making? I understand the obvious answer — that people will look for other ways to lower their costs — but maybe that doesn’t happen in a serious way until we’re paying $10 a gallon. I don’t think you can look to European tax policy as an example, because their geographic circumstances are so different from ours. My point is: it is critically important that the number be right. If you ask me to double or triple my automotive expenses for a specific cause, I expect to see results pretty quickly. Otherwise you’ve got a political donnybrook on your hands. And you need to have agreement on what the federal government will do with all that money. Should all of it go into the Highway Trust Fund — we do need to do something about congestion — or should a portion of it go to, say, a new nuclear submarine every year, or to a new gym for the House of Representatives?

2. I also have a question regarding your assertion that we need to stop hitting ourselves in the face by sending money over to oil-exporting nations that, either directly or indirectly, support the terrorist tactics of radical Islam. I couldn’t agree more. But if we stopped buying oil from those nations tomorrow — stopped cold — it would make no significant difference in their income. Oh, there would be a downturn in their revenue for a while, but India and China would make up the gap in short order. So the money would still be there. We’d have the satisfaction of knowing that we are not funding our enemies, but they’d still be funded. Am I missing something?

Richard Moore, Albany, N.Y.: While I agree with your assessment of the energy crisis and am in favor of a significant increase in the gasoline tax, I should point out that I agree because I can afford to agree. It wasn’t that long ago, however, that I commuted 70 miles round trip because I couldn’t afford a house in or near Princeton, N.J., where I worked. Actually, few who live in Princeton work in Princeton — business owners and old money exceptions notwithstanding. I now live within walking and biking distance of my work and a tank of gas lasts around a month. But I’m still very concerned about our gluttony for energy.

What I believe we need is a two-pronged approach to energy independence. First, as you point out, a realistic gasoline tax would encourage commuters to carpool or find other means to get to work. This leads me to my second element — put that additional money into improving mass transit and making it easier for people to walk or ride bicycles to their place of business. As I said, I can walk to work — but the route is along a heavily-traveled road, with cars and trucks whizzing by me an arm’s length away. Why not put down a 6-foot wide asphalt path along every road deemed a commuter route? It would certainly make it easier for me, and I’d wager that a great number of people who live even farther out would ride bicycles or walk. And it would be easy. I don’t get it.

Anyway, that’s my opinion.

Kathy Ann Walsh, Scottsdale, Ariz.: I understand and agree with your logic about the long-range effect that raising the gas tax would have in forcing auto makers to greatly improve fuel efficiency. And I realize that for upper-middle-class people and above, it would be a cost they could absorb without too much suffering. But I think there are an awful lot of people in this country who would be devastated by prices that high, especially in places that lack decent mass transit. Some of them would not be able to afford to get to their jobs. Some small-business owners like landscapers, who must use a vehicle in their businesses, would not always be able to pass the cost along to their customers. I don’t think tax breaks for the poor would be quick enough, so what else?
