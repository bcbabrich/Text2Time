Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Explore personal ideas about and interests in science.

2. Consider how James Cameron plans to try to interest the public in the ocean depths by reading and discussing the article “Filmmaker Employs the Arts to Promote the Sciences.”

3. In groups, use an assigned topic to create public service announcements promoting science.

4. Complete their PSAs by filming, storyboarding or designing them, and present them to science classes.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-paper

-classroom board

-copies of the article “Filmmaker Employs the Arts to Promote the Sciences,” found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050201tuesday.html (one per student) -resources about various science topics (science textbooks, encyclopedias, computers with Internet access)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following prompt (written on the board prior to class): “Director and screenwriter James Cameron said that humans must examine science from a standpoint of ‘wonder, awe and mystery.’ What experiences with nature or science have impressed you most? Why? In general, do you think your peers are interested in science? Why or why not?” After a few minutes, allow students time to share their answers.

Using a show of hands, ask students: How many of you are interested in science? How many of you want to become scientists or work in a scientific field?

Introduce James Cameron, the director and screenplay writer who is the focus of the article, “Filmmaker Employs the Arts to Promote the Sciences,” with biographical information found at //www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/cam0bio-1.

2. As a class, read and discuss the article “Filmmaker Employs the Arts to Promote the Sciences” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050201tuesday.html), focusing on the following questions:

a. What movie is the center of discussion in the article?

b. What technologies are used to make this movie?

c. How does the author of the article describe the experience of watching the film?

d. What argument does James Cameron make about getting people interested in science and research?

e. How many dives did it take for Mr. Cameron to get material for his film?

f. What was Mr. Cameron’s goal for this film?

g. How many submersibles can reach the deepest parts of the ocean?

h. What did Mr. Cameron discover about hydrothermal vents through his research?

i. What deep-sea topics, according to Mr. Cameron, are most unknown?

j. When will people begin looking at energy issues, according to Mr. Cameron?

l. Why, according to the interview, aren’t most people concerned with the depletion of the sea’s “great predatory species”?

m. When does Mr. Cameron think people will really understand that global climate change is real?

n. What technical challenges did Mr. Cameron face while making “Filmmaker Employs the Arts to Promote the Sciences”?

o. Why doesn’t Mr. Cameron think Hollywood has done a good job in portraying science in movies?

p. What motivates scientists to study how the earth works and how life works?

q. What type of science is used to make cellphones?

r. Why does Mr. Cameron think there is a “backswing” against science?

s. What does Mr. Cameron think will be the science stories of the 21st century?

t. To Mr. Cameron, for what is science a metaphor?

3. Divide into groups of four. Explain to students that each group will be responsible for creating a public service announcement (video, storyboard or print advertisement, depending upon resources) that shows kids that science is “cool” and focuses on a particular science topic.

Assign groups a topic mentioned in the article, “Filmmaker Employs the Arts to Promote the Sciences,” such as outer space, the ocean depths, volcanic activity, animal extinction, global warming and natural resources. For example, the group assigned the deep ocean can focus their PSA on a topic such as deep sea creatures, hydrothermal vents, or exploration, or compile various subtopics into a single PSA with a unifying theme. Encourage students to create a piece that shows how science is relevant to the everyday lives of young people.

Direct students to include the following information in their PSA (written on the board or copied into a handout for easier student access):

-adjectives to describe science beyond “cool” for a slogan to be used in their PSA (“Science is ”)

-fun facts or interesting superlatives relating to your topic

-career options and training programs

-connections of this area of science to everyday life

-importance and value of this topic

Once research is completed, groups should work together to brainstorm and complete written scripts for their PSAs.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Groups should either film, storyboard or design their PSAs, to be viewed or presented in a future class. (Before leaving class, groups should divide responsibilities so that each individual is working on a section for homework.) Other science classes may be invited to see the PSAs.

Further Questions for Discussion:

-What do you find most interesting about science? Why?

-Why don’t some people find science to be interesting?

-What do you do to take care of our world and environment?

-How is an Imax movie different from a regular movie?

-Why are scientists often stereotyped as nerds?

-What subjects or issues are you curious about? Why?

-How does research help to advance a civilization?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on completion of initial journal assignment, participation in class and group discussions, and thoughtful completion of planning and creating the PSAs.

Vocabulary:

celluloid, melded, geophysics, enchanted, submersibles, canvassed, biologists, geologists, riotously, chemosynthesis, photosynthesis, resilience, organisms, hydrothermal, volcanism, periodically, clarion, predatory, hybrid, mariculture, apex, stimulus, thermal, insurmountable, rig, idiosyncratic, villains, materialistic, aesthetically, pharmaceutical, semiconductors, quantum, electromagnetic, ascendancy, agrarian, efficiencies, pollution, metaphorically

Extension Activities:

1. Write a report on a famous scientist who has worked or is working in the area of science you examined during class.

2. Create a brochure about the relationship between humans and the ocean. Include both what humans get out of the oceans (in terms of natural resources, environmental stability) and how humans influence the oceans. Also include how changes to the ocean will affect people both directly and indirectly, and in the short term and long term.

3. Watch a movie that is centered on a scientific phenomenon, such as “Twister” (1996), “The Day After Tomorrow” (2004), or “Jurassic Park” (1993). Write a reaction paper about how accurately or inaccurately science is portrayed. Include examples of how science is portrayed, as well as your assessment of how it was represented. Then grade the movie on its scientific accuracy. Compile each individual report into a science movie review section for the school newspaper.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Fine Arts – Create an artistic representation of a scientific concept. You may choose to create a performance, painting, collage, film, poem, etc. Your creation must include the basic concepts and elements of the science, but also should reflect on the “wonder, awe and mystery” of this concept or idea.

Technology -Create a diagram of a submersible used to study the deep ocean. Include its appearance, what materials it is made of, the kinds of equipment that are inside, how they are powered and how they communicate with the surface, and what sort of conditions it needs to be able to withstand to survive deep ocean exploration.

-Create a “How It Works” poster explaining how a 3-D film is made, including the role the special glasses play in viewing this special effect.

Journalism – Interview a local scientist about his or her career and work, and the importance of science in the world. Write an article for the school newspaper.

Teaching with The Times – Read an article in the Science Times and write a reflection paper examining the facts, ideas or concepts that are most interesting to you. Consider: is this a field of study that interests you for the future? To order The New York Times for your classroom, click here.
