Imagine moving to Russia from the United States as a youngster, knowing barely a word of Russian, to apprentice yourself at one of the country’s most tradition-bound schools. Two budding American ballet dancers — Julian MacKay and Joy Womack — have done just that.

As I write in The Times, Julian and Joy are among only a small group of Americans who have ever trained at the prestigious and competitive Bolshoi academy in Moscow.

The experience has been thrilling but daunting. When they arrived last fall, their technique was deemed unworthy, their bodies in need of extensive reshaping. And they were told to lose weight, though it would have been hard to see why. No matter that Julian was only 12 and Joy was 15. This was the Bolshoi way.

Can a boy from Montana and a girl from Texas make it in Moscow? Read the article, watch the video and then submit your questions here to Julian and Joy. They are now finishing their first year at the academy, and have a lot of compelling insights into the Bolshoi method, Russian ballet and Russia itself.
