SUNDAY PUZZLE — You know what I like? I like a nice, relatively easy puzzle with a nice, relatively easy theme after a puzzle like yesterday’s Trip Payne tour de force. No math symbols. No tricks. No rebuses. Like today’s puzzle: a nice, well put-together letter-swap theme. And by Brendan Emmett Quigley, yet. That means lots of good pop culture. Just what the doctor ordered.

If you didn’t get it from the title, we’re taking out the Bs and substituting Ps for them, giving us soundalike phrases that are clued punnily. That means that when you take the base phrase “black art” and swap out the B for a P, you get PLAQUE ART, or “Engraving on an award.” Ah, I can feel my brain unclenching as I solve.

Of the theme entries, I really liked SECRET PALATE (instead of “secret ballot”), PLAQUE ART, THAT’S MY POI (instead of “That’s my boy”) and PLAYS OF GLORY (instead of “blaze of glory”).

In nontheme news, I liked TINY TOT, GIRL SHY, C.W. POST (complete with a nice factoid clue: “Breakfast cereal pioneer”), RED TEA (mmm, rooibos), AIRPOP, I CAN’T SEE, GEEZ and ACES UP.

With a Brendan Emmett Quigley puzzle, it’s tough to choose a Clue of the Day, but I’m going to go with “End of a shift?” for HEMLINE.

Constructor’s Notes

I keep a Google Keep list of ideas of puzzles I’d like to develop into puzzles. These ideas come at all sorts of times, out with my three-year old Tabitha, or shopping, or both. Sometimes they’re practically fully formed themes: here’s the gimmick, here’s most of the answers, boom. Othertimes, they’re a couple of seed entries for a themeless puzzle. And then there’s the one’s I like to call “theme answers in search of theme.” These are random turns of phrases that made me laugh for whatever reason but they’re not apparently obvious what to do with them. Today’s offering stemmed from that. A while back I’d written a note that read THE POISE ARE BACK IN TOWN.

I’ve heard the song “Bali Hai” way too many times (long story involving a school play and unexpected theater tickets) to post it here, so I’m going to go with this King Crimson song to end our solving week:
