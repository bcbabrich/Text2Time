As the Romanian Government fell last December, so did the Central University Library in Bucharest, burned to the ground by Nicolae Ceausescu's personal army.

Many rare manuscripts, about a half million books and other irreplaceable items were destroyed, said Vladimir F. Wertsman, a senior librarian at the New York Public Library.

Now, in a response to an appeal by the Society for Romanian Studies that appeared last month in The New York Review of Books, St. Lawrence University has organized a donation of about 4,000 books to the Bucharest library.

St. Lawrence's librarian, Richard Kuhta, and a professor of history, William Hunt, have collected about half the books for what they are calling ''Books for Bucharest.'' The Society for Romanian Studies has received 1,500 more books from 10 other colleges and universities, said Andrei Busuioceanu, director of the Romanian Library in Manhattan, where all the donated books are being stored before being shipped.
