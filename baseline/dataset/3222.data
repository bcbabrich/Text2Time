The glorious athletes of Eliot Feld's ''Aurora I'' might seem to inhabit a different universe from the sacred and profane gods of Mr. Feld's ''Gods Amused.'' But the two dissimilar sets of characters share an airy, idealized world, or so it seemed when the pieces were performed on the same program, presented by Ballet Tech on Wednesday night at the Joyce Theater.

''The Gods Amused'' was created in 1971, early in Mr. Feld's choreographic career. Set to Debussy, it is a luminous trio for two serene goddesses and a god with intriguingly savage undertones suggested by curved hands that suddenly, for a moment, curl into claws.

The trio allows for dancers' individual presences to color the choreography. Patricia Tuthill is an eager, active goddess and Jacquelyn Scafidi is a dreamer. Jason Jordan combines wildness and heroic godliness with impressive smoothness in a memorably well-danced, subtle portrait.

There is no room for individuality in ''Aurora I,'' choreographed in 1985 and set to a gleaming score by Steve Reich. Appearing and disappearing as if in the air, rising at the edge of an inclined ramp, the first few dancers look like astronauts reconnoitering outer space. But essentially the cast of 12 operate as elements in a shifting complex pattern, standing, sitting and sliding down with total aplomb. Allen Lee Hughes's stark lighting adds an element of drama and otherworldliness to the piece, whose white, colorfully banded shirts and pants were designed by Willa Kim.
