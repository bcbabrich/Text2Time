It would seem to be a bonanza for the Netscape Communications Corporation. Only a few months after releasing its first software, the company seems to be the runaway leader in a field with growth rates not seen since the early, heady days of the personal computer business.

The frenzy involves "browser" software -- programs that enable Internet users to navigate the phenomenally popular multimedia service known as the World Wide Web. And although other browsers are available, Netscape's Navigator software has emerged as many people's browser of choice.

Since December, more than three million copies of Netscape Navigator have been distributed. People use the software to visit any of thousands of sites and "home pages," replete with pictures and graphics, like CBS's "Late Night With David Letterman" home page or the new Web site from Ragu Spaghetti Sauce, called Mama's Cucina. On many of the most popular World Wide Web sites, three of every four visitors find their way there using Netscape Navigator.

"I'm astonished; I've never seen anything like this in my life," said James Clark, the 51-year-old chairman of the privately held Netscape, which is based in Mountain View, Calif. Those are not empty words, coming from Mr. Clark, who first found fame and fortune as founder of Silicon Graphics Inc., a successful maker of computer work stations and software.
