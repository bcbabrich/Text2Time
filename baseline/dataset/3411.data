It is usually Variety magazine, the hometown publication of Hollywood, where a reader can find the headline ''For Your Consideration'' above film-studio advertisements promoting a particular movie or actor. The audience for the ads tends to be voters who nominate and select the winners of the Academy Awards.

But the ''For Your Consideration'' form was transported to a different stage on Thursday, as The Wall Street Journal ran a full-page ad in The Washington Post, the hometown publication of national politics. At first blush, the message seemed to be: We Told You So.

Under the headline ''Who Is Bill Clinton?'' the ad -- a reprint of The Journal's editorial page Thursday -- excerpted seven years' worth of editorials about the President.

Two passages are favorites on Liberty Street, where the Manhattan-based Journal is published. One, which first ran on Jan. 18, 1994, reads, ''A special prosecutor will have irreconcilable mandates; if he sticks too strictly to the law the public will remain unsatisfied and skeptical; but if he exposes everything of legitimate public concern, he will look abusive by normal prosecutorial standards.''
