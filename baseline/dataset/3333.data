And in Ms. Richardson's third-grade class, Jelahn Wilson, 8, said the summer was ''not very long but it seemed fun.''

''I went on a trip to the Big Apple to see 'Beauty and the Beast,' and a trip to Funtime America,'' his essay began, then veered suddenly into the future tense to make up for the paucity of material. ''But next summer I think I am going to go to Jamaica with my grandmother because she needs help and. . . . ''

Under provisions of the state law that authorized New Jersey's publicly financed charter schools, the 46 such schools now in operation have more flexibility in programming, structure, setting and curriculum than other public schools. And three years ago, when the founders of Robert Treat Academy looked at the traditional school calendar, they saw a holdover from an agrarian time that had little to do with urban America and even less to do with the needs of Newark's children.

''We found out that we needed 25 percent more time in the day, and so we run from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.,'' said Stephen N. Adubato, one of the guiding forces behind the academy's creation and the executive director of the North Ward Center, a publicly financed social services agency in this mostly Italian and Hispanic neighborhood. ''And we found that we didn't need to have the kids out there hanging out in these dirty streets. They need structure, and this charter school is a lab with a license to innovate and test those things.''

Experts on the charter school movement, as well as those involved in the public debates over the extended school year, suggest that longer school days and years are unlikely to catch on at other public schools. For one thing, many charter schools are viewed as elitist, and as hostile competitors with other public schools for the best students. And the scheduling flexibility the charter schools enjoy reflects their freedom from the contract requirements and benefits that teachers' unions have worked hard to achieve and protect. (The unions and the New Jersey Department of Education have agreed to let the Legislature approve such flexibility, as long as the number of charter schools is limited.)
