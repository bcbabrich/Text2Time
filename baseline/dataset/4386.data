Although Gulko was, at 47, the oldest player in the tourney, he surely did not play like it. His overall performance level was very high and his games featured some nice combinations. In the eighth round, he went through the redoubtable Kaidanov like a buzz saw.

With 3 . . . Nf6, Kaidanov transposed into a gambit that also arises in the Center-Counter Game after 1 e4 d5 2 ed Nf6 3 c4 c6. Although it has never been demonstrated that White clearly gets the worst of it after 4 dc Nc6 5 d3 e5 6 Nc3 Bf5 7 Nf3 Bb4 8 Be2 e4 9 de Qd1 10 Kd1 O-O-O 11 Kc2 Ne4, everyone nowadays shies away from it. Gulko accepted the received opinion by declining the pawn offer with 4 d4. And after 4 . . . cd 5 Nc3 e6 6 Nf3, the game settled into a main line of the Semi-Tarrasch Defense.

The chief feature of the position after 7 cd Nd5 is the isolated d4 pawn. It has always been supposed to offer White some chances for a mating attack because it makes possible superior control of central space. But such an outspoken theoretician as the Danish grandmaster Bent Larsen insists that anything White has is nebulous. He further concludes that Black's strategy of defending his way into an advantageous endgame should prevail.

The move 10 . . . Bf6 is one of the preferred courses of completing Black's development. Most attention has gone into 11 Be4 Nce7 12 Ne5 g6 13 Bh6 Bg7 14 Bg7 Kg7 15 Qf3 with a slight advantage in freedom of movement for White. But perhaps 11 a3, which Gulko uses in this game, is stronger. For one thing, reduction of material with 11 . . . Nd4 12 Nd4 Bd4 13 Bh7 Kh7 14 Qd4 Nc3 15 Qc3 f6 16 Be3 does not solve Black's problems: his king is a bit exposed and White retains a lead in development.

The trouble with Kaidanov's 11 . . . Bd7 12 Bc2 Rc8 13 Ne4 Be7 14 Qd3 g6 was its passivity; its threat of 15 . . . Ncb4 16 ab Nb4 was stopped by 15 Bd2. And 15 . . . Qb6 robbed the black position of flexibility: a timely Nc5 could not be prevented by . . . b6. Gulko's 16 b4 seized queenside space without diminishing his chances for attack against the black king.
