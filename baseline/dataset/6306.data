PATERSON, N.J., Jan. 1— When the Labor Department designated this city and sur irounding Bergen and Passaic Counties as an area of “sub stantial” unemployment this week, it came as no surprise to Frank Kaster.

Shifting from foot‐to‐foot, waiting stolidly for the long line in which he was standing to inch its way up to the claims counter at the United States Employment Service office here, Mr. Kaster explained how he had been out of work for “about nine or 10 weeks.”

Though single, he found it “rough” to live on an unem ployment insurance check of $69 a week, and was puzzled as to why he had been laid off after eight years on the job at the Heller Candy Company.

“I used to bring the stuff up on the elevator,” he said, “and I got laid off with a lot of other people. They never told us anything.”
