A concerto can come into being in different ways. Most often, an instrumentalist will approach a composer whose music he finds appealing with a request for a concerto. Occasionally, a composer will write one for a performer whose playing he admires and present it to him.

My concerto for the cellist Janos Starker, which he will play in its world premiere Saturday at the 92d Street Y, had its beginnings at a dinner party in New York. It was a Sunday evening in October and we had all been to Gerard Schwarz's afternoon concert at the Y. He had conducted my Concerto a Quattro, a work dedicated to him, and then Janos Starker had played Dohnanyi's Konzertstuck, Op. 12. At the dinner, the hostess seated Starker and me at the end of the table, separated only by Gerard Schwarz's small daughter. I had met Starker before, but we had never talked at leisure. I had always admired his playing and found out that evening that he liked my music. Someone at the other end of the table, seeing us converse so intensely, made a joke about a Starker-Starer collaboration. We both laughed, but the germ took hold. We looked at each other: not only were our names similar, we are about the same age, we were both born in Europe but had lived most of our lives in this country, and we clearly liked each other. ''Not a bad idea,'' he said. Writing a concerto with a specific performer in mind is a good way to go about it, perhaps the best. In a way, the performer becomes the symbol of his instrument. Music history reports many such collaborations; the Brahms-Joachim one is probably the best known. Years ago I asked a close musical friend of Bartok's why Bartok had never written a cello concerto. His reply still sticks in my mind: ''Nobody ever asked him to write one.''

People sometimes ask whether a composer considers writing a tailor-made piece denigrating. To dwell on the term for a moment: obviously the composer does not measure the performer's circumference or the length of his instep. What he is very conscious of when writing for a specific performer are that player's outstanding qualities as he sees them. Sometimes other elements enter that connect their lives.

When I wrote my Third Piano Concerto for David Bar-Illan I kept in mind his enormous technical prowess, his brilliant octaves in both hands and his fine delicate staccato touch in the upper register. While writing my Violin Concerto for Itzhak Perlman I was very much aware of the fact that he was born in Israel, where I had spent nine years in my youth. For the jacket notes of the recording of the concerto I wrote, ''I tried to draw on that within me which is part of our heritage in common.''
