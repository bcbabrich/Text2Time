After years of searching for a suitable operator, New York City has found a group to rebuild and run the 110th Street Boathouse in Central Park as a restaurant.

The boathouse, now a burned-out, graffiti-encrusted shell, anchors the north shore of the Harlem Meer, one of the park's principal bodies of water. The Parks Department and members of the Harlem community want new structures for a restaurant and boathouse.

Last week, the Mayor's Concessions Review Committee gave the department the go-ahead to negotiate the reconstruction and license for a restaurant, boathouse and visitors center. The team submitting the proposal is a partnership of Harlem real-estate investors and a Harlem restaurateur. $5 Million Cost Estimate Calvin Copeland, owner of Copeland's Restaurant on West 145th Street and Broadway, would manage the restaurant and be the principal partner. The builders would be the General Atlantic Realty Corporation, developers of several projects in Harlem, and Webb & Brooker, Harlem real-estate agents.

The cost is estimated at $5 million, according to the Parks Department and its architects, Buttrick White & Burtis. The Central Park Conservancy, a privately financed organization that raises money for the park, spent $57,600 for a design of the project to make it more attractive to a developer.
