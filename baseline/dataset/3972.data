Civil liberties lawyers are quick to point out that the decision's immediate effects are limited. It leaves intact the individual's right to sue states in Federal court for violations of civil rights statutes under the umbrella of the 14th Amendment, which includes the decree that states cannot "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law." And it leaves open other legal mechanisms for challenging state actions in areas not covered by the 14th Amendment. But many of those mechanisms are now in a kind of political meltdown.

Congress, for example, can still attach conditions to the receipt of Federal money, including a requirement that states waive their immunity from private lawsuits in state courts if they accept the money. But as governors clamor for block grants, President Clinton has granted waivers of Federal welfare rules to more than half the states.

Similarly, the Federal Government can still enforce environmental or occupational safety laws through its regulatory agents, and can sue states in Federal court for failing to enforce those laws. But the Republican Congress has made cutting back on regulations one of its major goals.

"What's happening in the Supreme Court dovetails nicely with what's happening in the 104th Congress," Timothy Lynch, a constitutional scholar at the conservative Cato Institute, said. "If Robert Dole wins the White House," he added, "this trend is going to accelerate."

Laurence H. Tribe, a professor of law at Harvard University, said the reason a wide range of Federal laws included an individual right to sue in Federal court was that Congress wanted to put a right of enforcement action directly into the hands of the most affected parties. The new ruling, though, puts the states off limits for such Federal litigation.

An individual would now seem to be barred from suing a state university under Federal copyright laws if, for example, the university pirated his computer software, said David Strauss, a professor of law at the University of Chicago. A private business apparently could not collect damages from a state-run health maintenance organization that violated Federal truth-in-advertising laws, he said.

As states compete for industry, create public-private partnerships and privatize functions like prisons, the Supreme Court decision in the Florida case takes on wider significance. Its scope can be determined only through future litigation.
