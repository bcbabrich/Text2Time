A bomb exploded today in a safety shaft leading to an underground fuel pipeline near Rhein-Main Air Base, the police said. A spokesman said no one was hurt in the explosion, which occurred in the village of Morfelden-Walldorf, and there was little damage. A leftist group called the Revolutionary Cells took responsibility for the bombing in a telephone call to the village priest.
