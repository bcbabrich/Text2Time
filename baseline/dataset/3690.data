As Union Pacific heads into its own busiest season, with fall grain harvests and Christmas merchandise shipments, the congestion is only gradually easing. Improvements in Texas and elsewhere have raised average speeds throughout the 36,000-mile system to 15 miles an hour, from less than 12 in December, the company reported today.

But continued delays with shipments of chemicals, lumber, agricultural feed and other products in California are keeping speeds below the railroad's 18- or 19-mile-an-hour standard.

After decades of cutbacks in the industry, Union Pacific is bent on expanding along with the economy as the amount of cargo grows. The company is adding about 550 locomotives over two years to a fleet now at 7,200, and building additional tracks through crowded corridors in states like Nebraska. It has agreed to buy back a track in Kansas it sold and maintain a mountainous route in Colorado it was planning to abandon.

But, as railroad executives like to say, you cannot build the church for Easter. ''We've certainly learned the hard way that the days of seemingly unlimited capacity are behind us, and before we sign a contract we'd better be careful,'' said John Bromley, a company spokesman. ''That's a sea change in our thinking. We can't be all things to all people.''

Ed Rastatter, a policy director for the National Industrial Transportation League, said some well-planned rationing might be preferable to the unplanned rationing that resulted from the railroad's congestion. Noting he had not seen the Union Pacific announcement, he expressed doubts about whether all customers would benefit.

''This seems like a way of leaving out the little guy to make sure the big guy gets better service,'' he said. Mr. Davidson, however, said his railroad planned to carry additional smaller shipments as well, adding that chemical companies would continue to be major elements of his company's business.

Randy Speight, the Chemical Manufacturers Association distribution manager, said Union Pacific had already unsnarled its traffic around Houston, an industry hub.
