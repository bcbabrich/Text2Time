The American Broadcasting Company plans extensive changes in its television schedule. At least four shows will be dropped during the first quarter of the year and the future of two others is in doubt.

Shows to be canceled are “77 Sunset Strip,” “Channing,” “The Sid Caesar Show” and “The Edie Adams Show.” Those whose runs might also be curtailed are “The Jimmy Dean Show” and “The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters.”

The final telecast of “77 Sunset Strip,” the long‐running adventure series, will be on Feb. 7. On Friday, Feb. 14, from 7:30 to 8:30 P.M., it will be succeeded by “Destry,” a Western starring John Gavin. “Destry” will be filmed by Revue Productions. It was said that the show bears no resemblance to the motion picture that starred Jimmy Stewart and Marlene Dietrich.

“Channing,” a drama series about a college professor, will not be renewed beyond its initial 26‐week commitment, which expires in the middle of March. Its replacement on Wednesdays from 10 to 11 P.M. has not been selected.
