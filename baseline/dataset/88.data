‘I Love You, Now Die: The Commonwealth v. Michelle Carter’

Parts 1 and 2 start streaming: July 9 and 10

Is it a crime to urge someone to commit suicide? Michelle Carter was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2017 for encouraging her boyfriend Conrad Roy to kill himself, via text and phone calls. The documentary from Erin Lee Carr (whose father was David Carr, a New York Times columnist who died in 2015) explores the troubling context of this Massachusetts case, and the legal precedents it set. The film is divided into two parts, one dealing with the prosecution’s case, the other that of the defense.

In the writer-director Pippa Bianco’s award-winning feature debut, high school student Mandy (Rhianne Barreto) wakes up on her parents’ front lawn, wondering how she got there and what happened to her the night before. She soon finds out — her classmates are circulating a video in which she appears to be unconscious, lying on a floor with a laughing crowd gathered around and a boy pulling down her underwear. We enter into Mandy’s head space via hazy images, impressionistic flashes and extreme close-ups as she tries to figure out what happened, how she feels and what she wants to do about it.
