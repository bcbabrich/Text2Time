He said some of his shots had been disrupted by Patrick Ewing, the 37-year-old Knicks center. ''He might be an old guy, but he still can change a shot,'' Carter said. ''Couple times I got in there and he bumped me in the air and caused me to miss a couple easy layups.''

And some found fault with Carter for passing instead of shooting when the Raptors had a chance to win in the final moments of Game 2 last Wednesday at Madison Square Garden. Projected as the heir to Michael Jordan as the N.B.A.'s next marquee attraction, Carter in the past week seemed to be the epitome of his team: not quite ready for the rarefied air of the playoffs.

Charles Oakley, the former Knick, described the Raptors' season as ''more hype than what we're trying to accomplish as a team.''

He added: ''We haven't done anything as a team. We're still building.''

Worse than hype for Carter and others was the nasty exchange of words between Coach Butch Carter and several of his players last week. Among other things, the coach said his roster lacked leadership. He took Christie out of his starting role. Christie used the words ludicrous and dumb to describe the coach's comments. Dee Brown said the coach's remarks about player leadership were a cop-out. In that Butch Carter does not approve of headbands, Christie and Brown decided to wear black ones today.

When asked about communication with his coach since the demotion, Christie replied: ''I haven't talked to him once. He hasn't said anything to me. What's expected of me, he needs to let me know so I can go out there and do it.'' Of the other distractions of this series, such as Butch Carter's brief lawsuit against Marcus Camby of the Knicks, Christie said: ''I don't think I'll remember this series for anything on the court. It'll be off the court that this series is remembered.''
