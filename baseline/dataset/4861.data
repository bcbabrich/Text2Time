Moody's Investors Service assigned a B2 rating yesterday to the preferred equity redemption culmulative stock, or Percs, of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation, and it placed the $1.9 billion issue on its review list with the possibility of an upgrade.

The Standard & Poor's Corporation, meanwhile, gave the issue a BB- rating and also said it would consider an upgrade.

Moody's said the Percs had "strong equity characteristics," and noted that RJR Nabisco had stated that it hoped to exchange common stock for preferred.

Moody's also said it wondered whether "this infusion of equity represents an enduring change in the orientation towards financial risk on the part of RJR Nabisco's management." RJR Nabisco has a large amount of high-interest debt outstanding.
