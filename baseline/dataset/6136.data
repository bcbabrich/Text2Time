“The Water Engine” next month, and the official opening doesn't come until February.

Meanwhile, audiences have been coming, at $5 apiece plus whatever they spend on eating and drinking—rthe prices are modest and the food is simple and good—and what they have been seeing is uneven but generally worthwhile.

Dr. Buber's Hasidic tales can be brief and as unsubstantial as butterfly wings, but when the wings have passed by, a small bomb has been dropped and precisely detonated. The tales are funny, dreamy and purposeful; they circle, wander off vaguely and end up dead‐center on their target.

The Sills company—they were the creators of Story Theater—have a fine comic gravity and a dignified madness that is most appropriate. The trouble is that many of the tales are too” elusive for flesh-and-blood enactment.

The performance is most successful when several characters are required, when some real action must be played out. There is a particularly fine episode when Eugene Troobnick, bleary and unkempt, plays a water‐carrier who is dragged off to explain why his seder has been so much more incandescent than the rabbi's. “I am not a well water‐carrier,” he protests, and explains to the rabbi that he has done his eight days of drinking in advance.

Severn Darden's rabbi is the best thing in the evening. Mr. Darden, stout, white‐bearded, looks like a Santa Claus who has kept every one of his original teeth. He floats around tentatively, an incipient shrug possessing his shoulders, as he spins out his improbable answers to points of morals and doctrine. He is a perpetual “perhaps,” subject to fits of joy.
