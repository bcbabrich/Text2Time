Ralph Nader asserted yester day that the United States would “become a nation of slaves” unless safeguards and human values were integrated “before it's too late” into what he called the unregulated and uncontrolled use of computers.

In a wine‐ranging speech at the New York Hilton before the 25th annual convention of the 27,000‐member Association of Computing Machinery, Mr. Nader described in pessimistic terms the ramifications of a growing computer technology that, he said, is now “exclu sively in the domain of cor porate and governmental con trol.”

Because “the computer and the consumer should be the major concern of somebody in society,” the consumer crusader urged his audience to begin to infuse “human considerations and values” into the use of com puters.

Mr. Nader predicted that a “citizen backlash” against com puters was inevitable if their use remained completely apart from public review.
