Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

In this lesson, students will:

1. Discover challenges to civil discussions.

2. Examine the issue of incivility in the U.S. Congress through reading and discussion of “The High Costs of Rising Incivility on Capitol Hill.”

3. Carefully consider their class rules based on models and experience. Synthesize their research and experience by creating a new set of class rules.

4. Apply their research by amending their class rules for Congress.

Resources / Materials:

–classroom board

–pens/pencils

–paper

–computers with Internet access

–four index cards

–tape

–copies of “The Importance of Rules” from Thomas Jefferson’s A Manual of Parliamentary Practice ( //www.constitution.org/tj/tj-mpp.htm) (one for each student)

–poster board

–markers (enough for students to share)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Prior to the students’ arrival in class, arrange the desks in a circle (if space allows). Label four index cards, each with one of the following instructions: “Agree with me,” “Disagree with me,” “Ignore me,” and “Interrupt me or tell me to be quiet.”

As students enter the room, ask for four volunteers to take part in an exercise in civics and civility. Tape a labeled index card to each volunteer’s forehead or back, so that he or she cannot read the label. Make sure that everyone else in the class, as well as the other discussion participants, can read each card. Ask the students to sit in the circle, with the volunteers in the center. (If you do not have room for a circle, the volunteers may sit in the front of the room.) Explain to the four volunteers that they are going to plan a class party (alternatively, you can have them plan a homework assignment, based on whatever you are studying). Ask them to begin discussing their plans, with one caveat – they must adhere to the instructions printed on their classmates’ cards. The rest of the class observes the discussion.

After a few minutes, ask the students to remove their cards and sit down. Facilitate a short whole class discussion, using the prompts below:

–How difficult was it for the volunteers to make plans? Why?

–What would have helped them make plans?

–How did the roles the participants were assigned to play effect the discussion?

–Does everyone need to know “the rules” before a discussion can begin?

–If we had rules for this discussion, such as “No Interrupting,” how would the discussion have been different?

–How do we make sure that people follow the rules that we set up?

2. As a class read and discuss “The High Costs of Rising Incivility on Capitol Hill,” using the following questions:

a. What did Harry Reid (D-NV) say about the Senate Majority Leader, Bill Frist (R-TN)?

b. Why did Mr. Reid make such a remark?

c. How does political scientist Ross Baker believe that Congress is a “mirror image of the American people”?

d. What is the atmosphere described in the House and Senate?

e. About what legislation were Democratic leaders “shut out” of talks?

f. According to scholars who study Congress, why are Americans worse for such partisan behavior?

g. To what sort of procedural tactics are both parties resorting?

h. Why do the “spectacles” described in the article lower the public’s opinion of Congress as an institution? How is this reflected?

i. What historical examples of “unpleasantness” are cited in the article?

j. How do the Jeffersonian rules attempt to keep civility in the Congress?

k. Why are cross-party friendships increasingly rare?

l. What steps has the House taken to address the incivility?

m. Senator Olympia Snowe, a moderate Republican from Maine, is “deeply” concerned. What has she said about the partisanship in Congress?

n. Senators Bill Frist (R-TN) and Charles Schumer (D-NY) are both see “hopeful signs.” Cite examples from the article that “things aren’t as bad as they seem.”

o. Does Ross Baker, the political scientist, agree with Senators Frist and Schumer?

3. After reading and discussing “The High Costs of Rising Incivility on Capitol Hill,” divide students into small groups. In their groups, ask the students to reflect upon the Warm-Up exercise. In addition, have students look at the existing House rules for debate and decorum ( //www.house.gov/rules/house_rules_text.htm) or Thomas Jefferson’s A Manual of Parliamentary Practice – “The Importance of Rules”( //www.constitution.org/tj/tj-mpp.htm). Using their own experiences, as well as the written models to guide them, students examine and amend the class’s existing rules for discussion, or, draft their own class discussion rules. All rules should attempt to ensure civility upon enforcement. With their rules, students must include a respectful method of enforcement.

4. WRAP UP/HOWEWORK: Students continue to draft or amend class discussion rules. Either on a poster or in a letter to their members, students then amend their class rules for the needs of Congress. Allow students to present both sets of rules in a future class.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–Does having rules ensure people will obey them? Why or why not

–Can rules make people civil? Do they help? Explain.

–How might incivility get in the way of important discussions or debate?

–How do you react when others are not listening to you? How do you feel when people are being rude?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on thoughtful participation in both whole-class and small group discussions and carefully considered rules for both the class and Congress.

Vocabulary:

chamber, civility, pique, amateur, transcend, partisanship, initiatives, procedural, tactic, filibuster, inflames, evicted, recriminations, righteous, replete, Pecksniff, sniveling, abolitionist, impugn, disparage, censured, bare-knuckles, retreat, centrist.

Extension Activities:

1. Many schools employ an honor code. What is an honor code? Does it ensure civility? Do you believe that your school should employ an honor code? Why or why not? Write an editorial for your school newspaper.

2. “The High Costs of Rising Incivility on Capitol Hill” refers to two important pieces of legislative initiatives: the Medicare prescription drug measure and the energy bill. Research one of the initiatives. In a report, indicate what the measure is supposed to do, the major arguments both for and against, some of the “partisan compromises” in the initiative, how members voted, and what procedures both Republicans and Democrats used for or against passage.

3. Look at “A Manual for Parliamentary Practice” by Thomas Jefferson. Imagine that you have been asked to re-write one section for today’s Congress. Using clear and concise language, “translate” a section of Jefferson’s manual.

4. Examine partisanship and the role that it plays in your state and municipal leadership. On a chart, indicate the political affiliations of your state and municipal leadership. Find an example of an issue on which state and/or municipal leaders were divided by party. Find an example of an issue in which leaders worked across parties.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Research and report upon an incident of partisan conflict in Congress. For instance, you may report upon the caning of Senator Charles Sumner, or the censure of Senator Joseph McCarthy.

Fine Arts- Look at a selection of political cartoons online [such as those at The New York Times cartoon page (www.nytimes.com/pages/cartoons/) or at Daryl Cagle’s site (//cagle.slate.msn.com/)] Draw a political cartoon that reflects the incivility in the U.S. Congress. Alternatively, you may decide to interpret a cartoon about bipartisanship.

Global Studies- The United States is not alone in incivility among its leaders. Research the procedures that another representative democracy uses to keep its elected officials “civil.”

Media Studies- Do you think that televising debate in Congress has made it more partisan and volatile? Does conflict make for better coverage? Watch political news for a few days. Keep a journal of what you watch. At the end of week, decide whether the news would have been equally as compelling (or not) if political conflicts and squabbles remained untelevised.

Other Information on the Web:

The Official Web site of the Library of Congress (//thomas.loc.gov/) provides access to government databases and information on congressional activity, with schedules and transcripts from some of the congressional hearings.

Congress.org ( //congress.org/congressorg/home/) provides details on current issues and is a place to research Congressional voting records.
