Hubert Davis hit three consecutive 3-point shots to give North Carolina its biggest lead of the first half and the Tar Heels beat cold-shooting Georgia Tech, 91-74, tonight in what may have been Kenny Anderson's final home game.

The Yellow Jackets suffered their worst shooting half of the season, missing 31 of 40 shots, including 13 of 14 3-point attempts.

Anderson, the sophomore guard who said he may leave school for the National Basketball Association, was 1 for 10 from the field and had 4 points in the first half. Anderson, averaging 26.6 points on the season, finished with 15.

Rick Fox led North Carolina (22-4 over all, 10-3 in the Atlantic Coast Conference) with 18 points and George Lynch added 17.
