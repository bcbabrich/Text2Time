Yesterday, Mr. Beame politicked in public. The amplified plinking of a ukelele helped attract a polite but undemonstrative crowd to the Time‐Life Building plaza at 50th Street and the Avenue of the Americas to hear him challenge his Republican opponent's law‐and‐order rhetoric.

The presence of Mr. Beame attracted a crowd of dutiful Democratic officials — regular, reform and unclassifiable — to sit on a flat‐bed trailer bedecked in plastic red, white and blue bunting along with the man most politicians believe will be New York City's next Mayor.

Former Senator Eugene J. McCarthy introduced Mr. Beame as “the next Mayor” and Mr. Beame, reciting a familiar litany of official actions he has taken to help law enforcement, said: “This is how you fight crime. You don't fight it by taking out newspaper ads or by hysteria.”

Frank G. Rossetti, the Manhattan Democratic leader, was chief of protocol, allocating seats on the trailer, and was host later for hot dogs, soda and beer at the opening of Manhattan headquarters for the Democratic team—Mr. Beame, Paul O'Dwyer for City Council President and State Senator Harrison J. Goldin for Controller—at 16 West 57th Street.

Mr. Beame wore a big “Go Mets” lapel button and an air of cheerful confidence as he accepted the deferential attention of people who clearly consider him a winner and thus a man who will have some say about their political well‐being.

As far as Manhattan is concerned, Mr. Rossetti said, the black and Puerto Rican votes will be crucial and “I think we're going to do all right.”

Mr. Beame said he thought so, too. “Maybe it's just me,” he said with a shrug to indicate his awareness that a candidate can be fooled by what goes on in his immediate neighborhood, “but the reception's been so warm—I think it's going to be all right.”
