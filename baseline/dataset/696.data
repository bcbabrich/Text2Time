It is never a good sign when a movie produced and distributed throughout much of Asia in 2010 doesn’t make its American theatrical debut until five years later. And given the temperamental and editorial idiosyncrasies of the Weinstein Company, which executive-produced and controls distribution of “Shanghai,” a period espionage thriller directed by Mikael Hafstrom, you might be forgiven for expecting either an unfairly squelched masterpiece or an unholy mess.

The movie is neither, although it falls closer to the mess side of the table. Its convoluted plot seems to promise an early death by exposition in the first 20 minutes, although the fact that the story begins in October 1941, and that John Cusack plays a naval intelligence operative ought to clue most viewers in on where it’s going. A shot of Mr. Cusack playing cards in white tux and black tie means to evoke “Casablanca,” while the titular city’s who’s-in-charge-here division of authority has a strong “The Third Man” redolence.

“Shanghai” never grazes those heights, but the spectacular international cast, including the Asian film legends Chow Yun-Fat and Gong Li (as beautiful and charismatic here as she was in her screen debut almost 30 years ago — O.K., 25 years ago, given the current film’s actual production date), bring a lot of life to the movie’s uncooperative story material, as do Ken Watanabe, Franka Potente, and Mr. Cusack himself, despite his applying some too contemporary stresses to his good-man-in-a-bind character. The movie’s violence is loud and lurid, possibly needfully by the director’s standards, but gratuitously by this reviewer’s lights.

“Shanghai” is rated R for strong violence, some drug use and brief (too contemporary) language.
