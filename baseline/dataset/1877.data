The hoof specialist Ian McKinlay says that Big Brown, the Kentucky Derby and Preakness champ, does not need a patch on the quarter crack on his left front hoof until the morning of the Belmont Stakes. So the trainer Rick Dutrow will give Big Brown his final hard workout Tuesday without it and gallop him into the race confident the colt’s tender hoof is healed.

McKinlay changed the colt’s steel sutures Saturday and originally intended to put an acrylic and fiberglass patch on the three-quarters-inch crack on Monday. Instead, he told Dutrow on Sunday that the heel was healing perfectly and “the only thing we can do now is screw it up.”

“There isn’t a hint of blood, a hint of heat, a hint of anything,” McKinlay said. “If we covered it up and there was something way down deep and we don’t know it’s there, then it might pop up two days from now. I told Rick to let Big Brown heal on his own.”

McKinlay said Big Brown would be fine Tuesday, when he is expected to breeze five furlongs in his first and only workout since winning the Preakness.

“It is in absolutely perfect shape,” McKinlay said. “He looks like a million bucks and I can change those sutures every day if we want. If this thing goes wrong, I know I’ll look like the biggest idiot ever. But I know we’re taking the safest route possible. I’ll just patch him Saturday morning and he’ll be fine.”

Michelle Nevin has ridden Big Brown in all but one workout of his racing career and probably knows him better than anybody. She says he has not only healed, but he is also ready to make history as the 12th Triple Crown winner.

“He was very cheeky,” Nevin said of Big Brown’s strong gallop at Belmont Park on Sunday. “He felt good. He knows something is going on because all these people are around him all the time.”

Big Brown, the undefeated big bay, is indeed drawing a crowd. Even though Dutrow says that if Big Brown gets the lead in the mile-and-a-half Belmont, he will win, it has not scared away other challengers. Ready’s Echo worked five furlongs in 1 minute .91 seconds and is a late addition to a field that may now number as many as 10.

“We’re very happy with the way he went,” said Ready’s Echo’s trainer, Todd Pletcher, who won last year’s Belmont with Rags to Riches, the first filly champion in the race in 102 years.

He has yet to name a rider for Ready’s Echo, the son of Pletcher’s first accomplished horse, More Than Ready. The colt has a victory, two seconds and a third in four career starts.
