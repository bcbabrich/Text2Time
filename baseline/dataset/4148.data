Only a clutch play by shortstop Tony Fernandez kept the Royals from scoring more in the inning. With the bases loaded and one out, second baseman Joe Randa hit a hard grounder up the middle that Kamieniecki deflected with his bare hand. The ball rolled to second base, where Fernandez snared it, stepped on the bag and fired to first for an inning-ending double play. Still, the Yankees trailed for the first time this season, 4-1.

They closed the deficit to 4-3 when Fernandez and Velarde scored unearned runs in the fifth, but the Royals got to Kamieniecki again in their half of the inning. When Hamelin singled up the middle with one out, Showalter summoned right-hander Scott Bankhead for his first appearance as a Yankee.

"I had no command of anything," Kamieniecki said. "I was pitching from behind and they made me pay today. It seemed like whatever I tried didn't work out." He said Showalter "stuck with me a lot longer than I thought he would."

Bankhead, acquired in an Aug. 31 trade from the Red Sox, fared no better than Kamieniecki. He lasted only a third of an inning as the Royals greeted him with three consecutive hits. Gaetti belted a two-run homer over the left-field wall to make the score 6-3. Gagne then singled to right and went to third on Michael Tucker's liner to right.

The Royals then pulled off a double steal that the Yankees botched defensively with a bad throw from second base by Velarde, who was making his first start of the season.

As Tucker broke for second, Velarde cut off the throw from Stanley and seemed to have plenty of time to gun down Gagne, who was racing home. But Velarde's throw went in the dirt and past Stanley, allowing Gagne to score and Tucker to move to third on the error. Tucker then increased the lead to 8-3, scoring on a double by Brent Mayne. That was all for Bankhead, who allowed three runs and four hits before being relieved by left-hander Andy Pettitte.

The Royals made it 9-3 in the sixth when Wally Joyner doubled off Pettitte and scored when Mattingly mishandled a ground ball by Gaetti with two outs. Gaetti's grounder came off Brian Boehringer, who made his major league debut, replacing Pettitte with two outs in the sixth. Right-hander Jeff Patterson made his first major league appearance by pitching in the eighth for the Yankees, walking three but not allowing a run.

"It's a continuation of spring training for some of these guys," Showalter said. "They're all going to get better, especially Bankhead. He's better than that."
