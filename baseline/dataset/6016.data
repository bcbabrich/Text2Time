A small, prel;minary study of the physical effects of vasectomy on monkeys has led two medical researchers to suggest that the sterilization procedure might speed up the process of atherosclerosis in animals fed a high cholesterol diet.

The scientists, who reported their findings yesterday at a meeting of the American Fertility Society in New Orleans, said that the discovery represented the most serious possible side effect yet linked to the increasingly popular technique cf male sterilization. Atherosclerosis, the deposition of fat cn artery â€˜walls, is one of the major factors predisposing people to heart disease.

The researchers emphasized that their findings could not yet be used to implicate vasectomy in human beings as a factor in human atherosclerosis. Much more research would have to be done both to confirm the link in animals and to see whether it holds in people.

The research was conducted by Dr. Nancy J. Alexander of the Oregon Regional Primate Research Center in Beaverton and Dr. Thomas B. Clarkson of the Bowman Gray School of Medicine at Wake Forest University in North Carolina. Dr. Alexander is a recognized authority on reproductive physiology and the effects of vasectomy. Dr. Clarkson specializes in studies of atherosclerosis.
