IF options were bundles, Caroline Swann would have needed a shopping cart to help her off her plane the other day. Co‐producer of the late Brendan Behan's “The Hostage” and last season of what was collectively called “The Pinter Plays,” Mrs. Swann has come home laden with goodies she hopes will please palates off Broadway and on.

First, for fans of Harold Pinter, good news. Once again Mrs. Swann will have Pinter evenings, having returned with rights to two short plays, “The Room” and “A Slight Ache,” which she will present downtown at the Writers Stage in December. Word Baker has agreed to handle the direction and Mr. Pinter, himself, scheduled for a reading program from his works at the 92d Street Young Men's and Women's Hebrew Association on Nov. 12, will be here for the early days of rehearsals. Mrs. Swann says both works are in the tradition, full of mysteries, not to mention those characteristic silences.

For Broadway, a sort of petit‐four called “Boeing‐Boeing,” a comedy that's been tickling the English for the last two years. From the French of Mark Camoletti, in an adaptation by Beverly Cross, it is the account of a bachelor domiciled not far from Paris's efficient Orly Airport. This bachelor is engaged to hostesses from three different international airlines. He has matters so arranged that he is able to spend two days a week with each one, resting, not so much by Biblical command as out of necessity, on the seventh. When gremlins upset the airline schedules and all three planes arrive on the same day, the chap is in for it.

Jack Minster is to direct “Boeing‐Boeing,” with Gerald Harper to play the bachelor and Ian Carmichael portraying the friend who straightens out the aforementioned complications. The plan is to commence rehearsals in mid‐December and open here the end of January.
