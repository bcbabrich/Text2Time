TEHERAN, Iran, July 2â€”The Iranian Parliament is expected to approve legislation shortly providing new guarantees of the rights of political dissidents.

The bill amends the military prosecution law, which deals with security cases, and is seen as one of several recent steps aimed at improving the repressive image of the Government.

The move is viewed by some Iranian intellectuals as a result of real or anticipated pressures from the Carter Administration as well as international organizations dealing with human rights.

Iranian leaders, however, generally deny that the United States is exerting pressure over human rights or that there even is a human rights problem in this country. For them, the easing of authoritarianism is a result of greater security control.
