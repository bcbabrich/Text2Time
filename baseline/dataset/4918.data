Being pregnant can be a little like breaking a leg. Or so say Dr. and Mrs. Stork of Sherman Oaks, Calif., who are marketing a pink and blue bucket with everything needed to make a cast for ''a broken stomach.'' The Storks, also known as Fred and Dionne Scobie, call it ''Dr. Stork's Original Pregnant Tummy Cast Kit.''

People who break an arm can have their friends autograph their plastered appendage as a keepsake of their clumsiness. Now, too, mothers-to-be can have a memento of motherhood - besides the child, that is.

The idea was developed four and a half years ago when Mrs. Scobie was pregnant with her first child, David.

''I was eight months' pregnant, and I couldn't believe the size of my stomach,'' Mrs. Scobie said. ''One day I was hobbling around the house, and I told my husband that I felt like my stomach was broken.''
