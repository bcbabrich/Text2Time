The trustees of the Museum of the American Indian have asked the New York State Supreme Court to clarify the rights and obligations of the museum regarding the offer by the Texas computer executive H. Ross Perot to invest $70 million in the museum if it moves to Texas.

In a petition filed yesterday with the court, the museum's trustees asked for a hearing on Nov. 20.

For more than a decade, the museum has sought to relocate from its current address at 155th Street and Broadway, where it says the facilities are inadequate to display and store its collection.

The American Museum of Natural History has offered to help the museum relocate in a building that would adjoin it, but the Indian museum has rejected the offer, saying that it could not retain its independence in such a merger.

Attorney General Robert Abrams of New York has said that the trust agreement of the museum, established in 1916, requires that the museum remain in New York State. He has said that he will oppose any effort by the museum to get court approval to move from the state.
