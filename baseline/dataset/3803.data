In the modern annals of political warfare, no leader had been more effective than Yasir Arafat. He used its techniques and strategies to achieve major goals against an enemy far stronger militarily. But despite his successes, once again his character and ambitions have led Palestinians to the brink of disaster.

The Arafat techniques include an international propaganda campaign that made much of the world accept as truth the fiction that a part of Jerusalem is already a city in itself, with an Arab majority, belonging to Palestinians by history and right. Arab Jerusalem, or East Jerusalem, they call it.

Any action by Israel to defend its interests and sovereignty in that fictitious city, like opening a second door in an archeological tunnel or building apartments for Jews, is denounced by Mr. Arafat and countries around the world as provocation and justification for Arab riots and terrorist murders.

Terrorism is a built-in part of Mr. Arafat's political warfare. The technique is to promise to give it up as a weapon against the Jews. Collect for the promise. Then break it when necessary to put more pressure on Israel. Make the promise again. Collect.
