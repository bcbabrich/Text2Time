LONDON — ‘‘Eye-Witness,’’ in his latest descriptive account sent from General Headquarters, tells, as follows, how the soldiers passed Christmas at the front: ‘‘Christmas has come and gone, but it has brought no modification of the situation. On Christmas Eve a hard frost set in, and Dec. 25 was very cold, though it was not bright, for a mist hung over the countryside.

On our right, we captured a short length of German trench. It was also discovered that a group of buildings behind the German front line was being used as headquarters of some sort. The fire of a certain number of batteries was therefore concentrated on the spot, the buildings being first shelled with lyddite and then the ground all round being searched with shrapnel.’’ — The New York Herald, European Edition, Jan. 2, 1915
