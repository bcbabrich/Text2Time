To the Editor:

Community-based health care providers face daily obstacles to meeting the needs of mentally ill minorities and their families (front page, Aug. 27). For example, the New York State cap on Medicaid reimbursements for mental health services prevents the development of new programs.

The category-based Medicaid reimbursement system produces separate treatment approaches to mentally ill patients who also suffer from substance abuse and other medical problems, making it almost impossible to integrate services.

Medicaid managed care does not recognize treatment approaches that work with minority populations and forces providers to continue to use traditional therapies that are culturally insensitive.

The surgeon general's call for more cultural awareness will be to no avail if public policies continue to support a fragmented service system that is underfinanced and favors disjointed approaches to mental health.
