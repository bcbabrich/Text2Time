JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — The 2007 game between Florida and Georgia will be remembered for Georgia’s excessive celebration that propelled the Bulldogs to victory.

That move angered Florida’s head coach, Urban Meyer, so much that he ordered his team not to comment on it this week. And if Florida’s 49-10 victory wasn’t enough of an answer, Meyer used a bit of return gamesmanship when he called two timeouts in the final minute to extend the daylong toast to Florida football. Meyer kept a straight face when asked about the timeouts after the game.

“Moody was running the ball real hard and I wanted to get him a couple of more carries,” he said of the reserve tailback Emmanuel Moody. “He deserved that right.”



Asked if people could perceive it as rubbing it in, he said: “No. I was just trying to win a game. That’s all we’re trying to do is win a game. We tackled really well on defense.”

Georgia Coach Mark Richt wasn’t as impressed. Asked about the timeouts he gave a stoic response.

“The rules say you can have three timeouts per half,” he said. “He used them. That’s perfectly legal to do. There’s nothing wrong with that.”

Meyer was pressed on the issue, and he kept coming back to the same topic, “tackling well.”

“We tackled very well, that’s what we did,” Meyer said. “That’s the only answer. If anyone says there’s another way to answer a loss the previous year. The only thing we’re answering to is a loss, that’s it.”

He paused and then said: “Boy, our guys tackled well. Make sure you put that in there. I don’t see you writing. Write that down.”

Let it be written, this rivalry has a new chapter.
