Juan Hamilton, the potter who was the longtime friend and companion of Georgia O'Keeffe, said yesterday that he was relieved at the settlement of the court battle over the painter's $70 million estate. ''We're in the process of doing a centennial O'Keeffe exhibition, to open at the National Gallery in Washington this November,'' he said. ''It would be disheartening to celebrate her work and her contributions to American culture while at the same time this sideshow was going on in the courts.''

Two suits, brought separately by two O'Keeffe relatives, charged that Mr. Hamilton had exerted ''undue influence'' over the ailing artist, who died on March 6, 1986, at the age of 98. The settlement last week replaces him as the recipient of her residuary estate, estimated to be worth $47.2 million -largely in works of art by Miss O'Keeffe and photographs by her husband, Alfred Stieglitz - and sets up a foundation to receive and administer it. It also returns to the estate the proceeds from a house in Santa Fe bought by Miss O'Keeffe in 1984 for $2.6 million and deeded to Mr. Hamilton. He had assumed the mortgage payments on it and sold it last June for $2.1 million. Miss O'Keeffe spent her last days at the house with him, his wife and two children. What He Gets

But Mr. Hamilton will keep such legacies as Miss O'Keeffe's own home in Ghost Ranch, N.M.; more than two dozen works of art by her and other artists; her papers and the copyrights she held, along with much of her personal property. Her correspondence will go to Yale University.

''I'm very glad it's been accomplished after only a year and a half of litigation,'' said the 41-year-old Mr. Hamilton, who met Miss O'Keeffe in 1973 and settled into her home as caretaker, confidant, aide and business manager until her death. ''Many artists' estates have been tied up for years in the courts, and while Miss O'Keeffe was alive we spent a good deal of time in litigation ourselves.'' The artist and Mr. Hamilton were sued in 1978 by her longtime agent, Doris Bry, who challenged Miss O'Keeffe's dismissal of her and charged that it was a result of Mr. Hamilton's ''malicious interference.'' The suits were resolved by confidential agreements.
