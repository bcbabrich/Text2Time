When a young child has an epileptic seizure for the first time, many parents share the same worries: Will it happen again? And will it be worse next time?

A new study may lay some of the fears to rest, at least for many parents.

Writing in the current Annals of Neurology, researchers offer evidence that if the first seizure is short, in all probability any subsequent ones will be, too.

The issue is important because while many children experience no harm from a seizure, scary as it can be, longer seizures can be damaging.

Moreover, while most seizures stop on their own, longer ones can require medical intervention.

The lead author of the study, Dr. Shlomo Shinnar, a neurologist at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx and a professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said the findings might prove useful for parents trying to decide whether medicine is needed right after they learn the child has epilepsy. Many prefer to avoid that route, concerned about side effects.
