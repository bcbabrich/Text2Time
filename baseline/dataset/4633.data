The Spicing of America

The American appetite for spicy food has yet to be sated. Total consumption of spice last year was 821 million pounds, an increase of 3 percent over the year before, according to figures from the American Spice Trade Association. Black pepper, up 18 percent, now accounts for about 10 percent of total spice consumption. Consumption of red peppers like cayenne and chili increased by about 10 percent. While its rise last year was not as striking as black pepper's, total red-pepper consumption amounted to 155 million pounds, nearly 20 percent of the total. Foods From All Over

On Saturday from 11 A.M. to 10:30 P.M., Water Street in lower Manhattan, from Fulton to State streets, will be the scene of a food festival. Restaurants and small vendors from all over New York will sell foods of many of the city's ethnic populations. In addition to Manhattan restaurants like Rosa Mexicano and Tropica, Greek restaurants in Astoria, Queens, Korean restaurants in Flushing, Queens, and the River Cafe in Brooklyn plan to take part.

Fish Ban in Italy

A parasitic round worm called the Anisakis nematode infests fish caught and eaten in many countries, including the United States. In Italy, the Ministry of Health has prohibited restaurants and other food-service outlets from serving raw, marinated-uncooked and cold-smoked fish. The ministry called sardines, anchovies, mackerel, red mullet and cod especially risky.

Only if the fish has been treated to kill the parasites, by freezing at less than 0 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 24 hours, or by heating to 140 degrees for 10 minutes, is it considered safe. The ministry said the parasites pose a health risk only if they are alive. Fish Market Branches Out
