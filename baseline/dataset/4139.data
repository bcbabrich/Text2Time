The 40 home runs will be forever frozen, forever incomplete, a memorial to group stubbornness, mass greed, tandem failure by the owners and the players. Now, at least, there is hope that Ken Griffey Jr. can start all over with a clean slate, a new wall.

You could feel this hope racing all over North America yesterday, overwhelming the Final Four, intruding on brunch along Pike Market, even interrupting the O. J. trial, if you can imagine that. Perhaps soon again, Ken Griffey Jr. would be roaming the artificial lawn of the Kingdome, swinging his mace, the way he does on that billboard, and everything would be all right with the world.

"I resisted baseball in the Kingdome as long as I could," a friend of mine said Thursday night. "I was going to work in my garden and play outdoors and not waste the good weather in some lousy dome. But then I started taking my kids to games, and there was Ken Griffey, throwing the ball 300 feet on a line, throwing a runner out at home plate, and hitting all those home runs, and I was hooked. I was a fan."

A fan. There is no fan like a baseball fan -- action every day, action every night, games, stats, replays, probable pitchers, hope every single day. Now there is hope of being a fan again. By granting the injunction requested by the National Labor Relations Board yesterday, U.S. District Judge Sonia Sotomayor in Manhattan did everything but sweep off home plate and bellow, "Play ball!" Sotomayor's ruling sent players rushing to call the airlines to find out how quickly they could get to spring training. There is still much to work out, but at least there was hope of avoiding the owners' ghastly threat to their own product: replacement baseball. That ugly scenario was to take place as soon as tomorrow night, when the ersatz Mets were scheduled to play the fraudulent Marlins in Miami.

"Even though opening day is days away, the parties have time to salvage it," she said, adding that she felt the pressure of time. "I probably would have liked more time to practice my swing."
