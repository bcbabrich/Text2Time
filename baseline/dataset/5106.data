Sergio Leone, the Italian director who revived western films in the 1960's and added distinction and style to a genre known as spaghetti westerns, died of a heart attack yesterday at his home in Rome. He was 67 years old.

Mr. Leone, who co-wrote many of his films, gained fame and catapulted Clint Eastwood to international stardom by directing and co-writing three violence-packed hits, ''A Fistful of Dollars,'' ''For a Few Dollars More'' and ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.'' The protagonists were cool, laconic, beleagured loners dueling in a spare sun-blanched terrain.

The director, who hailed John Ford as his mentor, said, ''All the killings in my films are exaggerated because I wanted to make a tongue-in-cheek satire on run-of-the-mill westerns.'' Another guideline was that women were introduced only if they advanced the plots. Otherwise, he said, a love situation ''arrests the rhythm of a story.'' 'Strength and Simplicity'

''The cowboy picture has got lost in psychology,'' he told an interviewer. ''The West was made by violent uncomplicated men, and it is this strength and simplicity that I try to recapture in my pictures.''
