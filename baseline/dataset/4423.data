These are huge tasks, not least because they require an assault on the C.I.A.'s anachronistic culture and its belief, inherited from the cold war, that it alone knows what's best for the country. That belief is largely responsible for the contempt in which the C.I.A. holds Congress and the conviction that anything goes, including evading the law and the Constitution.

Opening the C.I.A. to public inspection -- or at least Congressional inspection -- is critical. And openness begins with the budget. The intelligence budget, unlike all other budgets, is largely secret. This allows the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies to escape public justification for what they're doing. Mr. Woolsey can begin by publishing the budget -- attaching real numbers to specific agencies and broad functions.

The overall intelligence budget -- which includes the National Reconnaissance Office and the National Security Agency -- is an estimated $29 billion. It may be more. Either way, it's excessive. The resources devoted to the Soviet problem dropped from half the 1990 budget to slightly more than a third for the coming year. But the overall budget has been reduced by just a fraction. Surely other intelligence requirements cannot absorb the remaining billions.

Many career officers insist that deeper cuts will leave America deaf and blind. Yet money isn't the problem; the C.I.A. was rolling in money when it failed to predict the revolution in Iran and grossly overestimated the strength of the Soviet economy and, later, the strength of the Iraqi Army.

The real problem lies in the way the C.I.A. has traditionally concocted its intelligence assessments. These are inevitably a product of a committee of bureaucrats with vested interests in their programs, budgets and pet theories, with ears attuned to what top officials want to hear. What emerges is often mush.
