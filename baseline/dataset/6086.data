SATURDAY. SEPTEMBER 3, 1977

Malaysia's attitude to Vietnamese seeking refuge in the country has softened. American diplomats say this has followed President Carter's decision to admit 15,000 refugees from Indochina and the offer of other Western countries to take some in. Thailand and especially Malaysia are not so fearful now that they will be permanently burdened. Malaysia no longer pushes the “boat people” back out to sea. Of the 8,000 refugees in transit camps from Japan to Indochina, 3,000 are in Malaysia. Only Western nations have offered asylum to the wanderers. No Asian nation has acknowledged an obligation to give permanent asylum. [Page 1, Columns 2‐4.]

The latest British‐American proposals for a Rhodesian settlement are “mad,” “crazy” and ‘insane,” Prime Minister Ian D. Smith said in a television news conference in Salisbury. He stopped short of an outright rejection, however, and said that his Government would give the proposals serious consideration before responding, possibly with Counterproposals. [3:6.]

Rumania's human rights movement appears to have been crushed completely. President Nicolae Ceausescu has succeeded in eliminating visible dissent with comparatively little punitive action. Paul Goma, the novelist who was the movement's leader, has been silenced as have been hundreds of others who only five months ago were signing petitions, appealing for support from International organizations, and even staging modest demonstrations. Mr. Goma has been put to work in the National Library in Bucharest and he and his famliy have been given a new apartment, but no telephone. [3:1‐2.]

A rise in the unemployment rate in August of two‐tenths of a percentage point to 7.1 percent of the total labor force was reported by the Labor Department. Almost all of the increase, the department said, was concentrated among blacks. Civil rights leaders asserted that the new figures confirmed charges made by black leaders that the Administration had neglected blacks, the poor and the cities. [1:6.]
