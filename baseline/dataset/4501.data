Question: How can I track the performance of mutual funds that are not listed by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system?

Answer: To qualify for a listing with Nasdaq, which provides fund data for most newspapers and magazines, a fund generally must have either $25 million in assets or 1,000 or more shareholders. Today about 3,100 funds are Nasdaq-listed and 217 are not, according to Morningstar Inc., fund researchers in Chicago.

Tracking the performance of nonlisted funds on a daily basis is almost impossible, said John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds, an investing newsletter. Some financial publications, however, publish weekly quotations, and more do so on a quarterly basis.

While nonlisted funds tend to be small and relatively new, that's not always the case, said Gerald W. Perritt, editor of the Mutual Fund Letter, in Chicago. He recommends two no-load growth funds that are small but do have solid histories: Crabbe Huson Special (until recently Crabbe Huson Growth), in Portland, Ore., a value fund, and the Fasciano Fund, in Chicago, which owns shares in small companies.
