To the Editor:

Donal Henahan's comments on Tchaikovsky's operatic Joan of Arc [''The Musical Mystery of St. Joan,'' March 11] barely touch upon the real problem. Joan is by nature an undramatic character. Even in George Bernard Shaw's ''St. Joan'' she is a plot device and a foil for the Dauphin, the Archbishop, the Inquisitor and practically everyone else. Joan gets uplifting lines and a few earthy quips; the rest get human personalities and dilemmas.

Not only is she unworldly, but we already know exactly where she is going and how she gets there. The one decent aria Tchaikovsky gives her, ''Adieu forets,'' displays the only emotion with which we mortals and sinners might empathize.

It's the same problem in every cinematic Jesus treatment, from ''King of Kings'' to ''The Last Testament.'' How much better if these movies focused on Judas, Peter, Pilate or Mary Magdalene instead of Christ Himself, whose only genuine drama begins and ends in His agonized prayer in Gethsemane.

Shakespeare handled the St. Joan syndrome best, in ''Julius Caesar,'' by dispatching the title character halfway through the play and letting all the interesting ones, Brutus, Cassius and the rest, slug it out to the end.
