Steve Trachsel held his glove to his face, concealing his mouth, but his facial muscles churned as he spoke to the pitching coach Charlie Hough. The Yankees had one out, a run in and men on first and third in the fourth inning last night and were already ahead, 3-0. Hough was trying to coax Trachsel through two more outs.

''I was just battling through it,'' Trachsel said.

Five days before, Trachsel had become the first starting pitcher in 26 years to retire at least the first 15 batters he faced in consecutive games. Last night, neck spasms hindered Trachsel's control as the Yankees pummeled the Mets, 8-0.

That ended a seven-day stretch in which the Mets lost four of six games to the division-leading Braves and Yankees and three games in the standing to Atlanta. The Mets, who are fourth in the National League East, are 10 1/2 games out of first place and eight games behind for the wild-card berth with a week to go before the All-Star Game break.

''We have to really just concentrate on wins,'' Mo Vaughn said. ''I don't know how this team has gone about its business in past years, but I hear a lot about this is a second-half ballclub. We have to wait, too, try to get some wins in this last week or so before the All-Star break. It's too far to be thinking about whether we're in it or we're out of it. We just have to try to win a game.''
