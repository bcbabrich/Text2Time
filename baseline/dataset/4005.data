With the Rev. Al Sharpton and two other black ministers sitting, at his invitation, in a front pew of St. Patrick's Cathedral, John Cardinal O'Connor yesterday denounced the apparent racism behind the burning of black churches in the South and asked Catholics to aid in the rebuilding of the destroyed houses of worship.

"The black church is the ultimate treasure for the black people," the Cardinal said, describing it as a refuge during the time of slavery and an enduring beacon of hope. "To strike at that church is to strike at their pearl."

The Cardinal delivered an impassioned message that racism has no place in Christianity, which he said celebrates the shared humanity of all people. "We are truly one body of Christ," he said. "If we don't know that, if we don't accept that, if we don't believe that, we have nothing."

More than three dozen Southern churches with predominantly black or integrated congregations have burned in the last 18 months. About a dozen people have been arrested in connection with the fires, and some have been determined to be accidental.
