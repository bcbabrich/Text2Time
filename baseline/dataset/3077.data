JAMES LIPTON, the host of ''Inside the Actors Studio'' at the New School, uses a combination of abject fawning over his guests, a pomposity that even he acknowledges, and astute and diligent research to achieve what most talk show hosts never attain: a serious and studied look at the craft of filmmaking and acting. The program, shown on Bravo, attracts some of the industry's best known, from Tom Hanks to Spike Lee to Steven Spielberg. No one is interrupted. Criticism is nonexistent. Dud projects are ignored. No one is ambushed.

''It is not journalism,'' Mr. Lipton said. ''It is meant as an antidote to what is normally done with these people. I want to create an environment where people are willing to talk about the craft, not about themselves as people but as artists.''

Mr. Lipton, who does not give his age, is a squat, elfish man, with a manicured beard and shoes with uncommonly high heels. He is probably as adept at mythmaking as many of those he questions. ''The students ask what I am like,'' he said, of the 238 students he oversees as the dean of the Actors Studio Drama School of New School University in Greenwich Village. ''I am an enigma. I like it like this. I do not want publicity.''

Yet he has a copious amount of material about himself within handy reach in his office. His 11-page biography begins at age 2, when he says he began to read; moves on to 3, when he says he started writing poetry; and skips to 12, when he says he ''completed three novels.'' He calls his 1968 book ''An Exaltation of Larks'' -- which he worked on with his wife, Kedakai, a graphic designer -- ''a publishing classic.''
