If the walls of 273 Water Street, N.Y., N.Y. 10004 could talk, the dainty would have to block their ears. During its more than 200 years this small brick derelict has been a brothel, a home for ''fallen women'' and a saloon called Kit Burns's Sportsman's Hall, where bad men paid good money to watch dogs fight rats. It's also seen wars, pestilence, riots and squatters.

And now this Mother Courage of houses, the third-oldest building in Manhattan, is facing a new challenge. Its new owners, who got it at an auction of city properties for $325,000, hope to turn it into offices and a ground-floor store.

The Captain Rose House was named for the merchant who built it on what was once a riverfront, and kept his brig out back. That it outlasted the 18th century, let alone the 19th and most of the 20th, is a miracle. What British troops didn't destroy, the city's frequent fires and constant demolition did.

But as is so often the case with survivors, each year marked another step down the social ladder for 273 Water Street. What this poor house has had to put up with! Swarms of children bouncing balls off its brick facade before running along for a swim off Coenties Slip. Addicts seeking laudanum in the days when the house was an apothecary shop. Seamen sleeping off last night's grog in the days when it was a hotel. And, of course, the yapping of dogs and the squeaking of rats and the sobs of those fallen women.
