WASHINGTON — For decades, brand-name and generic drug companies have fought each other in Congress, at international trade negotiations and in court. So when the world’s largest generic drug company moved this year to join the powerful trade association for producers of brand-name medicines, pharmaceutical lobbyists were in a swivet.

The trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, known as PhRMA, is plunging into battles over drug prices here and in many state capitols. And the request from the generic company, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, is raising eyebrows in PhRMA’s secretive councils.

Some brand-name drug companies have expressed alarm at the prospect that Teva will join their ranks, a move some see as tantamount to allowing a spy into the fold.

If PhRMA “broadens its membership to include the world’s largest generic company, the association’s emphasis on innovation will be diluted,” Carlos Alban, an executive vice president of the brand-name drug maker AbbVie, wrote in late May in a letter to the board of the trade association.
