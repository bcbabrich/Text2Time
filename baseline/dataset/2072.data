As Formula One probably says goodbye to Magny-Cours, many people are leaving the track with a sense of relief that it is over. It has been a weekend of truly mixed emotions. The highs of great results from Robert Kubica, a return for Ferrari to top form, a Kimi Raikkonen lifting himself out of the doldrums to victory again. But on the other side, another horrendous reminder of how close the circuit is to racing calamity, with the terrible GP2 accident yesterday, from which, fortunately, the driver escaped with only bruising, and like Kubica before him, a small concussion. But the Formula One paddock learned this morning of tragic news. Three people were killed and two were seriously injured in a helicopter accident last night, as they flew from the circuit to a hotel in a nearby town. The injured people were connected to the Bridgestone tire manufacturer, but the identity of the victims has not yet been made public, although it involves at least two Formula One paddock people.

Within days we will all be at Silverstone, and Lewis Hamilton will return home with a 14-point lead on Fernando Alonso in the drivers’ series. In its post-race issue today, The Red Bulletin, reminded readers of the hysteria that surrounded Nigel Mansell’s visits to Silverstone, and “a burst of Damon Hill-inspired fanaticism in the mid-90s.” After that period, the Bulletin says, “Silverstone has been quiet…but that’s about to change.” According to track officials, the Bulletin says, interest for the race has “gone off the chart.”

I’ll provide updates. For now, off I go back to my hotel in the countryside near the Magny-Cours circuit for possibly the last time at a French Grand Prix. There have been many fine memories here, and unfortunately, other kinds as well.
