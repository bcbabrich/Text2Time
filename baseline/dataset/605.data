THURSDAY PUZZLE — I truly hope you’re not sick of hearing about the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, because we’re not done yet. Yes, the big boards have been put away, and I’m still working on another photo feature called “Humans of A.C.P.T.,” but in the meantime, above are some highlights from Puzzle 7.

Today’s bonus question is this: When is a homage to a fellow constructor not merely a homage?

Answer: When it’s a collaboration with the very constructor you were honoring.

In 2008, a puzzle by Joe Krozel garnered a lot of attention because the black squares formed a word that seemed incendiary for a crossword puzzle. If you haven’t solved this one, give it a try. The concept behind the letters formed by the black squares and their connection to the clues made a Thursday puzzle — supposedly the “trickiest” one of the week, if not the most difficult — absolutely take flight.

Today, Timothy Polin collaborates with Mr. Krozel on a similarly awesome idea that also carves a word into the grid. Not happy with merely one word, however, our constructors have chose to anagram the four letters S, H, U, and T and turn the conceit of “clue in the clues, entry in the grid” on its ear. While the bracketed [One arrangement of the letters in the grid] is what we’re given in the clue list, the clue to the anagrammed arrangement of letters is actually the answer. Not sure what I’m babbling about? Check this out:

1 Across: CABANAS, which is what you get when the four letters spell “H-U-T-S” 21 Across: SEAL, which is what you get when the four letters spell “S-H-U-T” 8 Down: REAR, which is what you get when the four letters spell “T-U-S-H” 26 Down: ERGO, which is what you get when the four letters spell “T-H-U-S”

And while there is the teensiest bit of junk in the grid, I think the fill here is mic-drop fabulous. Look at those long entries: STUPID PET TRICKS, ATOMIC REACTORS, REESE’S PIECES (you had me right there, Messrs. Polin and Krozel), SPINAL TAP, BLEEP OUT, NATIONAL PASTIME, ALL THOSE AGAINST (my personal favorite) and SEASONED TO TASTE.

Our constructors have a lot to say about the construction of this very cool puzzle, so I’ll turn it over to them:

Constructors’s Notes:

Timothy Polin: When I thought up this idea about a year ago, I held out almost no hope that I’d be able to complete the puzzle on my own. Such a wide-open grid was pretty daunting, even without four theme answers that had to fit somewhere. I played around with it, and managed to fit three themers and fill everything left of the S, but I just couldn’t finish the East half. So I set the puzzle aside. In all likelihood it would have remained in draft limbo forever, too, had Joe not written me a very kind email last year after my comments on Xword Info had referenced a couple of his puzzles. I jumped at the chance to ask the creator of this puzzle’s inspiration for his take on my take of his grid letter concept. By some miracle he liked the idea, and it took us five or six weeks to go from empty grid to submission. The final grid ended up with about half of Joe’s fill and about half of mine. Joe did tremendous work refining the theme, insisting, among other things, that the theme entries be at least four letters long and spaced throughout the grid. Using SIC instead of ERGO, for example, would have made our task easier, but the longer entry felt more elegant and more exact. Joe Krozel: Tim approached me with this puzzle theme all worked out, and I was impressed that he had found a set of letters to accomplish the trick. So, the challenge that Tim invited me to undertake was to actually fill a grid which embodied his idea. My first little bit of meddling was to shorten the S and expand the H and the U … reducing the three-letter count from 24 to 17. We knew the East region would be difficult, so we generated a list of potential theme words that could be sprinkled around the grid. I suspected that a short theme entry could hide inside the ‘S,’ so it was only a matter of being persistent to get that region to fill. Once that section was locked down and PORTRAITS was in place, we concentrated on the West until achieving a fill we were happy with. We both had fun last August trying to figure out how to “solve” this puzzle’s construction, and we hope you enjoy your own solves as well.

I would say that Mr. Polin and Mr. Krozel have given their puzzle that “extra push,” as Nigel Tufnel of SPINAL TAP would say:

Your thoughts?

In an earlier version of this post, the word “TUSH” was presented as an entry in the crossword puzzle. The word “REAR” is the entry, and the anagrammed, black square letters can spell out the word “TUSH.” Also, the word “ERGO” is the entry, while “THUS” is the anagrammed, black letter spelling. Stop laughing. This is my job.
