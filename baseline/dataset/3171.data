Though most of the 46 agencies in the evaluation released yesterday operate group homes for adolescents, their residences range in size from small city apartments for three or four teenagers, to the 150-acre Westchester campus of Children's Village, where the 462 residents include some as young as 5.

The three city offices that were evaluated run 30 homes, the smallest an apartment for three teenagers under employee supervision, the largest, three centers that temporarily house 24 teenagers with mental and emotional problems.

Some comparisons within the rankings are instructive, however. Good Shepherd Services, the top-rated agency, operates some of the same types of programs for the same kinds of difficult teenagers as the city office in last place.

Sister Paulette LoMonaco, who has directed Good Shepherd's program for two decades, says that one key to its success is a much better staff-to-child ratio than the state requires or that city payments alone would cover. When the state cut foster care rates a few years ago, she said, she successfully sought grants from private foundations, like the Robin Hood Foundation, to supplement the city contract.

Though state rules allow one staff member to supervise nine teenagers, for example, Good Shepherd's Barbara Blum home in Brooklyn, a short-term diagnostic center for 12 teenage boys, never has fewer than three counselors present at all times, she said, and all its social workers have master's degrees. Ratios are similar at its 34-bed transitional residence for teenage girls on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

At the same time, most agencies run such a large and varied mix of residential programs that large differences in quality may be missed by just looking at the rankings. The last-ranked agency, for example, the city office for Queens and Manhattan, runs 12 homes, including a quiet brownstone on West 85th Street, which is known as one of the best city-run group homes.

''We should get a hundred,'' protested a 19-year-old girl who was crocheting in the brownstone's cozy living room when a reporter stopped by unannounced this week. ''They talk to us, they love us. In my other group home, I could leave at 3 o'clock in the morning and they'd be just looking, like, 'whatever.' ''
