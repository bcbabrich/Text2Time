One way musicians express the joy of having Mieczyslaw Horszowski still among us playing the piano so beautifully is to think of different ways to describe the extraordinary span of time his career has covered.

The New York Times has been reporting on his concerts for 83 years.

He started playing in public before John McCormack, Amelita Galli-Curci or Tito Schipa started singing in public.

When he first came to New York he played at the newest uptown hall, Carnegie.

His birthdate is closer to Brahms's than to Ivo Pogorelich's.

If his pupil Murray Perahia keeps going this long, he will play at Town Hall in February 2043.

That is where Mr. Horszowski played the most satisfying piano recital this critic has heard all season - perhaps in several seasons - Sunday afternoon. As he approaches 100 (he will turn 97 in a few months), he only seems to improve; this recital was better than the one I heard in 1986.
