The Lockheed Martin Corporation has scored some minor legal victories so far in defending itself against the Government's effort to block its proposed $8.3 billion takeover of the Northrop Grumman Corporation.

But winning early skirmishes and winning the war are two different matters.

Yesterday, a Federal judge turned away Defense Department objections and ordered the Government to give Lockheed some documents it sought within 10 days. The same judge also indicated he was leaning toward Lockheed's request to start the trial by early summer, at least two months before the Government wants the case heard.

Still, most antitrust experts say Lockheed faces at best a slim chance of prevailing in the largest antitrust case brought by the Government. Their analysis boils down to one simple vision: the specter of the Secretary of Defense, under oath, telling the court that a Lockheed-Northrop union would threaten national security.

''This case is an incredible long shot for Lockheed,'' said Marc Schildkraut, an antitrust lawyer with Howrey & Simon. ''You have Lockheed's main customer, the Defense Department, coming out and saying this deal will hurt us. I think a judge would be sympathetic. That is the best thing that Justice has going for it.''
