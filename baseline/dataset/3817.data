The House of Representatives today passed a bill that would increase and speed up adoptions of children who have been abused or abandoned by their parents.

The measure, approved 416 to 5, would make far-reaching changes in child welfare programs and Federal law, so states could more easily take youngsters away from parents who had abused them. The changes include new requirements and financial incentives for states.

Lawmakers from both parties said state officials had often tried to reunify families at all costs, with dire consequences for some children, who were beaten or even killed by their biological parents.

''The current system sometimes errs in favor of family reunification, without regard for the child's safety,'' said Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, the Connecticut Democrat who is a co-author of the bill.
