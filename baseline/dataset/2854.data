In contrast to Syria's previous belligerent statements about the need for an immediate end to the American occupation of Iraq, however, Mr. Assad softened his country's position. Asked how he felt about having 100,000 American soldiers as his newest neighbors, he sounded almost resigned.

''The problem is not whether you have one American soldier or a million American soldiers on your borders,'' he said. ''And the problem is not whether they are going to stay one year or 10 years. The problem is whether the U.S. is going to become a power for achieving turbulence in the region instead of being an element of stability.''

Mr. Assad acknowledged that it was up to the Iraqis to decide on the opportune moment for the United States to withdraw, but said democracy could not be achieved at gunpoint. ''I think the solution in Iraq is to allow the Iraqis to write their own constitution and to elect their own government,'' he said.

In those remarks, the Syrian president joined the unusual chorus of Arab leaders calling for measures in Iraq that often do not exist in their own countries. Although there is an official political opposition here, it is largely toothless. The Baath Party and various police agencies run the country, with rigorous controls against dissent, and much of the economy is state controlled.

Mr. Assad ruled out the deployment of Syrian troops as part of any peacekeeping force in Iraq, saying that given decades of friction between the countries, a Syrian contingent would probably be unacceptable to the Iraqis.

The American invasion at first seemed to give Syria a case of the jitters. On the day that the United States Army brought the statue of Saddam Hussein crashing down in Baghdad, Syrian television broadcast a long documentary about Islamic architecture. On the streets of Damascus at the time, Syrians could be heard whispering jokes about knocking over their own statues, or at least winning greater freedom.

Mr. Assad conceded that some of his fellow citizens might have considered the upheaval in Iraq contagious, but said any idea of Iraq as a model for change was fading beneath the grim reality of daily violence.
