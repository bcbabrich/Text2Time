To the Editor:

Your Aug. 16 news article on Spandau Prison, accompanying the obituary of Rudolf Hess, refers to Hermann Goring at Nuremberg as a field marshal. While it is true that Goring once held this rank, after the fall of France, when Hitler rewarded his victorious generals with marshals' batons, the corpulent head of the Luftwaffe received the unique title of Reich Marshal. Thus, the man who said, ''whenever I hear the word culture, I reach for my revolver,'' is the highest-ranking German military officer to date. TOM MOORE Madison, Wis., Aug. 18, 1987
