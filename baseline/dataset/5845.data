''I do not think we will have any problem filling the building,'' he said.

The new building is also to have a direct fiber-optic connection to a satellite communications center called Teleport, to be built by the Port Authority in northwestern Staten Island. Companies that rely heavily on sophisticated communications and computers are increasingly seeking such capabilities, according to Mr. Silverstein.

The building would add an estimated 10,000 people to a complex already teeming with 50,000 people who work there and 80,000 who pass through each day. Mr. Silverstein said he thought transit, eating and shopping facilities in the area could accommodate the influx. Substation to Be Concealed

Space at the new structure is expected to rent for between $35 and $40 a square foot. Under the agreement with the development company, the Port Authority initially is to receive $6.75 for every square foot of space rented, Mr. Lynch said. Its bid of $6.75 per square foot made Silverstein Properties the highest of five bidders.

The site is bounded by Vesey, Washington and Barclay Streets and West Broadway. It is now occupied by a two- story Consolidated Edison Company substation, which the new building will conceal almost entirely.

The main entrance of 7 World Trade Center is to be 30 feet above street level and accessible from a covered 150-foot- wide walkway that passes over Vesey Street and opens onto the plaza level of the trade center. Escalators are to take people from that level down to the trade center's main concourse, to three subway lines and the PATH line, and to the complex's garage. There are also to be street-level entrances to the building.

The other buildings in the complex, in addition to the twin towers, are the 9-story Commodity Exchange, the 9-story Northeast Plaza Building, the 8-story United States Custom House, and the 22-story Vista International Hotel.

For years, Mayor Koch, who is expected to be among the dignitaries at the ground breaking, has pressed the Port Authority to sell the trade center buildings to private landlords, contending that in doing so, New York City could collect as much as $100 million a year in real-estate taxes. The city now receives $11 million in lieu of taxes from the Port Authority. Governor Cuomo has said he is not certain whether the trade center should be sold.
