A Collector of Cuisines Is Ready to Share Them

Three years ago, after closing Road to Mandalay, her Burmese restaurant in SoHo, Irene Khin Wong went to Southeast Asia to travel throughout the region, sampling its foods, and to do consulting work for restaurants and hotels in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Last summer she returned to New York, and in December she founded Saffron 59, at 59 Fourth Avenue (Ninth Street), a caterer specializing in the foods of Southeast Asia.

The menu lists nearly 100 dishes suitable for small dinners or large receptions. Among them are Vietnamese spring rolls with shrimp, Hanoi pho soup with cellophane noodles, Cambodian ginger fish salad, Burmese beef curry with roasted potatoes, Malaysian shrimp in pineapple sauce, Thai green chicken curry and Singapore rice sticks.

Desserts blend East and West, with confections like coconut creme brulee, mango sorbet with lemon grass syrup and apricot-ginger biscotti. For parties booked this month for dates through Aug. 15, Saffron 59 is offering a 15 percent discount. Information: (212) 253-1343.

What's in That Caviar Tin?

Regulations aimed at curtailing the black market in caviar go into effect today. The Federal Fish and Wildlife Service will require that tins of caviar carry labels showing that the roe was obtained in compliance with an agreement signed by 144 nations to protect the declining stocks of sturgeon.
