RATHER than climb rung by rung up the party organization, Mario Cuomo came to political prominence under the sponsorship of one man, Hugh L. Carey. Still, there is general agreement, even among Mr. Cuomo's political foes, that in his first year he has been a better politician than his predecessor, or for that matter than any Democratic Governor of New York since Franklin Roosevelt. ''I have to give him high marks, much more than could have been expected,'' said David Garth, the media consultant on two of Mayor Koch's campaigns against Mr. Cuomo, with a .500 batting average.

There are at least two measures of Mr. Cuomo's political skills - his dealings with the state Democratic Party and his handling of the budding Presidential campaign, which could make him either the national personality New York governors used to be or leave him the forlorn, forgotten figure Mr. Carey was in 1976 and 1980.

Mr. Cuomo staked his claim to political leadership by keeping local politicians neutral until he concluded a series of Presidential forums that gave him a national spotlight as an up and comer. Then he quickly moved to endorse Walter F. Mondale, heading off rivals, including Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink, who intended to be there first.

Mr. Cuomo insisted that he, rather than Mondale aides, should put together the former Vice President's state campaign. He named as its chairman a trusted aide, William C. Hennessy, the Transportion Commissioner under Mr. Carey who was Mr. Cuomo's choice for state Democratic chairman. As a result, Timothy Russert, the Governor's counselor, has been able to boast, ''I don't believe there has been a more unified state party behind a Presidential campaign.''
