Engineers have found a new use for energy captured from the sun: keeping cars cool.

On a sunny summer day, the temperature inside a parked car can exceed 140 degrees. That makes it very difficult for people when they enter the car, and it can age vinyl and other materials faster.

For the last three years, though, Intersolar Ltd. of England has sold a device that combines solar cells and a ventilation fan. It has been available in the United States only through catalogues, but this spring the fan will be sold at Eckerd's Drug Stores and other retail outlets, priced at $25.

The product, called Auto Vent, hangs on a rear window that is open just a crack, and pushes overheated air out through a slit on top. Cooler air is drawn in through the car's ventilation ducts.

Auto Vent is a perfect use for solar cells because they run best when the sun is bright, and that is when they are needed most to cool a car.
