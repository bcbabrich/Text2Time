Brant Hall, the Lehigh quarterback, has not made anyone in this football-crazed valley forget Phil Stambaugh, who holds the university's passing records for completions, yardage and touchdowns.

Pete Lembo, Lehigh's first-year coach, is not nearly as colorful as his fiery predecessor, Kevin Higgins. Higgins left to be an assistant coach with the Detroit Lions after turning Lehigh into one of the top Division I-AA programs.

But replacing local legends has not stood in the way of perfection for the Mountain Hawks (10-0). Lehigh, the Patriot League champion, is ranked fifth in Division I-AA entering its first-round playoff game at home Saturday against No. 9 Hofstra (9-2). Under Higgins, Lehigh won the Patriot League title three straight years and finished the regular season unbeaten twice.

''When Kevin left, he has such a legacy here I'm sure there were many comparisons made,'' Lembo said. ''We've continued the program's success.''
