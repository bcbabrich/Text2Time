Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes- 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Compare independence and autonomy when referring to a country’s political status; understand the history of East Timor’s struggle for independence under Indonesian rule.

2. Examine the significance of the August 30, 1999 vote in East Timor in relation to the history of the territory by reading and discussing “In Huge, Model Vote, East Timorese Choose Their Future.”

3. Analyze, in small groups, the actions of East Timorese citizens, the Indonesian government, the East Timorese government, the United Nations and separatist groups in East Timor as described in the featured article, as well as their reactions to one another.

4. Display and present their assigned group’s actions and reactions as described in the article in whatever way they choose; continue this analysis exercise as vote results are confirmed and once the results are enacted by using other newspaper articles from The New York Times or other sources.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-paper

-pens/pencils

-classroom blackboard

-copies of “In Huge, Model Vote, East Timorese Choose Their Future” (one per student)

-five pieces of white poster board

-assortment of colored markers

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following questions (written on the board prior to class): What does “independence” mean when referring to the status of a country? What is the country free to do when it is “independent”? What is the difference between independence and autonomy? Students then share their answers. Help students more accurately define the difference between independence and autonomy, if necessary. Then, provide students a brief history of East Timor and its struggle for independence from Indonesian rule (such as that provided in the Background section of this lesson).

2. As a class, read and discuss “In Huge, Model Vote, East Timorese Choose Their Future,” focusing on the following questions:

a. What words are used to describe the voters in East Timor, and why might Seth Mydans have chosen these words?

b. Why does the first paragraph include that “the conduct of the vote… was just about as good as it could be”? What elements of the past and present history of East Timor are reflected in this statement?

c. Who currently controls East Timor, and what is the name of their leader? What offer did he make on Monday to East Timor regarding this vote?

d. On what did voters vote?

e. What history of East Timor’s rule is discussed in the article? Why is this history important in understanding the significance of this vote?

f. Why do you think so many people turned out to vote?

g. What groups threaten the welfare of the East Timorese, and why? How do these groups fit into understanding this historic vote?

h. What East Timorese government groups are mentioned in the article, and what role did they play in the vote?

i. What does the Jakarta official quoted in the article mean when he says, “the military has been pretty unscrupulous about pushing for the pro-autonomy forces to win. But it’s looking like they may be prepared to accept a loss and go on to the other problems, of which they have plenty”? What other discussion is there in the article of the influence and reactions of the Indonesian government in East Timor and in this vote? What changes are currently occurring in Indonesia?

j. Many East Timorese citizens are quoted in the article. How might their statements reflect the tumultuous history of East Timor and the possible effects of independence from Indonesian rule?

k. What role does the United Nations play in this vote?

l. What will happen if the East Timorese vote results in the territory’s independence?

3. Divide students into five groups, and assign each group one of the following organizations or groups of people affected directly by the status of East Timor: East Timorese citizens, Indonesian government, East Timorese government, the United Nations, separatist groups in East Timor. Explain to students that they will be examining newspaper articles following the events and effects of the vote in East Timor, focusing on the actions of the assigned group and their reactions to the other four groups (as much as available in the article). Students then skim the article in their small groups, noting the specific information given about and by their assigned group of people involved in this historic vote. When taking notes, students should be sure to separate notes by actions and reactions to each of the other groups. In other words, the “East Timorese citizens” group not only notes the citizens’ actions as described in the article but also how the citizens are reacting to the Indonesian government, East Timorese government, the United Nations and the separatist groups.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Give each small group a piece of poster board and some markers. Each group then displays their assigned group’s actions and reactions as described in the article in whatever way they choose (timeline format, concept map, outline, etc.). At the beginning of the next class, each group should present their poster and discuss why the different groups involved in the vote are acting and reacting in such ways. In future classes, bring in other articles about the vote in East Timor from The New York Times or other sources for students to analyze in these groups as described in parts 3 and 4 of this lesson.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–What other countries are in the same region of the world as East Timor, and how might they be affected by the recent vote there?

–What comparisons can be made between East Timor and other historical events with respect to colonization and military occupation?

–What is the history of military occupation in East Timor?

–Why would a territory want to seek independence from another country? Why might the territory want to seek autonomy from that country?

–What are the possible results, both positive and negative, of the independence of East Timor from Indonesian rule?

–What are the pros and cons of military occupation of colonized territories such as East Timor?

–What freedoms do you feel should be allowed to all humans, regardless of where they lie? Why is it so difficult to enforce these freedoms on an international level?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on written journal responses, participation in class discussions, and ongoing evaluation of newspaper articles tracing the results of the vote in East Timor.

Vocabulary:

optimistic, referendum, militias, momentum, autonomous, status, separatist, insurgency, diplomat, subdue, unscrupulous, disarray, debilitating, assembly, formality, rampage, threadbare, interim, expertise, cede

Extension Activities:

1. Diagram the electoral and voting processes in East Timor and Indonesia, as well as in other countries. Then, compare your diagrams. In what countries are elections most free in terms of the ability to run for office, choose elected officials and decide upon important laws? Where are there still restrictions on running for office and on voting?

2. Examine the issue of human rights in Indonesia and East Timor, as well as in other nations in that region of the world. What human rights issues have been and are being raised, and why? What is being done to stop violation of human rights in this region, and by whom? Create a “Bill of Human Rights” that you feel should be decreed in that region, as well as worldwide.

3. Learn about East Timor’s relationship with Indonesia, and examine how the recent elections in Indonesia (June, 1999) have affected and might continue to affect East Timor.

4. Several of the East Timorese citizens quoted in the article discuss national pride. What fosters national pride, and how is this pride manifested?

5. Research colonialism as practiced by European countries (particularly Portugal) and how it has affected the history, culture and people of the various colonized countries.

6. Learn about the role of the United Nations in determining a country’s “status.”

7. Study the political, economic and social structures, as well as the history, of West Timor.

8. Use past United Nations Human Development Reports (you can access 1990-1998’s HDI’s on line at (//www.undp.org/hdro/index.htm)) to compare many facets of the average socioeconomic status of East Timor, Indonesia, other countries in the region, and your country. What do these statistics illustrate? How might East Timor’s independence affect the statistics for these countries, and why?

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Create a timeline of the steps taken in the United States’ gaining independence from Great Britain, making your comments as general as possible. What types of groups were involved? What obstacles had to be overcome? What steps were taken to gain independence, and how did the British react?

Civics- Compare the voter turnout of the elections in East Timor to the turnout of national elections in the United States in the recent past. Why might voter turnout have been stronger in East Timor than in the United States? Graphically compare the statistics provided in the featured article to statistics from the upcoming presidential primaries and local elections in your city or state.

Geography

-Locate the cities, regions and countries mentioned in the featured article and in other related articles on a map. Then, investigate the significance of these places to past and present East Timor and Indonesia.

-Compare and contrast cultural similarities and differences among the many countries in the region of East Timor (such as Indonesia, Java, Malaysia, and the Philippines).

Language Arts- Write a journal entry from the perspective of a citizen who is able to vote freely for the first time. What does he or she feel about this new freedom? What hesitations might this person have? Why is this freedom important to this citizen?

Media Studies- Find articles in Indonesian newspapers, as well as in papers from that region (including Australia) and around the world, that discuss the voting in East Timor. Ecola Newsstand (//www.ecola.com) is a fantastic resource of English-language newspapers around the world. Why do different publications in different countries have varied views about the vote and its results? How is this vote anticipated to affect other countries in the region? How might this vote affect the international community, and why? Create a scrapbook or collage (using headlines and photographs from various papers) of your findings.

background: Timor is an island in southern Indonesia in the Malay Archipelago. The island was settled by the Portuguese in the early 1500s, and the Dutch competed for influence until the early 1900s when final boundaries were determined. East Timor was a Dutch-Portuguese colony before decolonization and forcible annexation by Indonesia in 1975. However, the United Nations has not recognized East Timor as an Indonesia possession. Human rights organizations claim that more than 200,000 people (one-third of the native population) died as a direct result of the invasion. Today, military occupation of East Timor continues to be a “hot topic” because of the territory’s history of human rights abuses and disputes over territorial authority.
