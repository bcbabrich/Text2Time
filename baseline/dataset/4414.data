Complaints of police misconduct included in civil lawsuits will be investigated immediately by the New York City Police Department as part of the expanded duties of the new Internal Affairs Bureau, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly announced yesterday.

Previously, lawsuits based on such complaints as excessive force, false arrest, assault and civil rights violations had to wend their way through the courts before the department conducted more than cursory reviews. Now, investigations could lead to departmental hearings long before the lawsuits are heard, helping the city to decide whether to represent the officer or whether criminal charges should be drawn.

Jeremy Travis, Deputy Commissioner for Legal Affairs, said the new policy could also reduce the amount the city pays out in settlements against police officers, but added that was not the primary impetus for the change. He estimated that 200 to 300 cases a year would be investigated.

In making the announcement yesterday, Commissioner Kelly, who in November ordered sweeping changes in the way the department monitors its integrity, said the new procedure would "enhance the role of the new Internal Affairs Bureau and give it the mandate to weed out police officers who abuse their public trust."
