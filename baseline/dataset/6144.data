MELBOURNE, Australia, Jan. 1 (UPI)—Ken Rosewall survived a scare from a highly touted high school student 24 years his junior today and reached the semifinals of the $100,000 Australian open tennis tournament.

Rosewall, 41. needed all his poise and experience to subdue Australia's latest tennis sensation, Brad Drewett, 6‐4, 3‐6, 6‐2, 6‐2, in 112‐degree heat in Kooyong Stadiurn.

Also reaching the semifinals was Mark Edmondson, who defeated Dick Crealy, a fellow Australian. 7‐5. 7‐6, 6‐2. Crealy ousted fourthseeded Stan Smith of the United States yesterday.

Drewett, a blond lefthander, had gained the quarterfinals by beating another 41‐year‐old rival, Mal Anderson, in a New Year's Eve upset. Anderson later said he believed Drewett to be the best Aussie youngster he's seen since Newcombe.
