REMEMBER that chestnut about the quintessential article in The Reader's Digest, "New Hope for the Dead"? The results of an annual survey have indicated that for the first time in many years, there are signs of a turnaround in the strained and troubled relationship between agencies and clients.

"There's still room for improvement," said Nancy L. Salz, president of Nancy L. Salz Consulting in New York, who offered a preview last week of the 1996 Salz Survey of Advertiser-Agency Relations. "But this is dramatic and encouraging."

The results of the survey, which Salz Consulting has sponsored for 11 years, are closely watched because the ability of marketers and agencies to work together bears directly on the effectiveness of the advertising that is produced.

"There will always be different perspectives on the process," Ms. Salz said, "but you've got to collaborate to create a good ad." Agencies in particular "feel that communication is very important to getting terrific work," she added.
