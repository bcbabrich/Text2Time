Lots of felons who go to jail find religion to cure their souls. Politicians who are ailing seem to find the mere threat of longer imprisonment to be remarkably therapeutic.

Remember L. Judson Morhouse? Why would you?

But in his heyday, before becoming a historical toenote, Morhouse was the New York Republican state chairman. He was instrumental in electing a novice candidate named Nelson Rockefeller as governor.

Morhouse was later convicted in a bribery scheme to secure a liquor license for the Manhattan Playboy Club. Two days before Christmas 1970 and a month after the conviction was upheld, Rockefeller commuted his sentence. The reason? Morhouse was suffering from Parkinson’s disease. Further imprisonment would shorten his life.

Morhouse managed to live another 13 years, ­ three years longer than the man who prosecuted him.

Politicians are notoriously windy, but some, despite their convictions, can’t seem to finish a sentence.

Morhouse’s miraculous recovery was brought to mind the other day when Mario Biaggi celebrated his 90th birthday in the Bronx. You may not remember Biaggi, either, but he was a genuine biggie in New York. Hailed as a hero cop, the most decorated police officer. Elected as a congressman from the Bronx, which he represented for two decades. And almost mayor of New York City in 1973, until prosecutors leaked to The Times the fact that he once refused to testify before a grand jury.

Personally, Biaggi was one nice guy, immensely loyal and empathetic, beloved by constituents and colleagues. He insisted he was the victim of anti-Italian bias, of guilt by association. As a reporter, I remember imploring him: If he was really innocent, why not prove it by petitioning the court to grant a rare legal remedy and release his grand jury testimony?

Biaggi finally agreed. And he must have been heartened when his case came before a judge who was a fellow Italian. Unfortunately for Biaggi, the judge was Italian by heritage, but spoke French at home. He called Biaggi’s bluff.

Sure enough, the grand jury transcript confirmed that Biaggi had invoked his constitutional privileges against incrimination. He insisted he had fudged only to protect his daughter, for whom he had arranged a job with an ad agency connected to Yonkers Raceway. Prosecutors implied that her salary might have been intended for him, but the grand jury adjourned without filing charges.

In any event, his short-lived mayoral campaign was over.

Biaggi continued to serve in Congress, though, until 1988, after he was convicted in two other cases. One seemed like a cheapo charge: receiving a free vacation from his friend Meade Esposito, the Brooklyn Democratic boss, for arranging government contracts for one of Esposito’s clients.

The other was that he had illegally received $1.8 million in stock and cash from Wedtech, a corporation that prosecutors ­ including Rudy Giuliani charged had been transformed into a racketeering enterprise that bribed public officials for government contracts. Biaggi insisted in court that the hostile testimony and unflattering publicity were punishment enough. “I died a little bit every day,” he said.

He was sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment. After a little more than two years, though, ­ six months before he would have been eligible for parole, the judge released Biaggi. He was suffering from what his lawyer described as life-threatening illnesses.

That was in 1991.

By the following year, he had recovered sufficiently to run for Congress again. But his district had been reconstituted, diluting his base. He lost.

Last week, Biaggi celebrated his 90th birthday at a Bronx restaurant with, among other dignitaries, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly and Congressmen Charles Rangel and Peter King.

How did he explain his survival 16 years later?

“Hey,” he said, “it wasn’t supposed to be a death sentence. I returned to New York to get superior medical care.”

Which he continues to get. He had surgery recently for colon cancer. He walks with crutches and sometimes uses a wheelchair.

He also still insists on his innocence.

I asked him, if he had been more careful, might he have avoided the cloud of smoke that finally led prosecutors to the fire?

“I was famous for being a service congressman,” he told me. “What does that mean? That means I went out and got involved in every issue. I would go where angels feared to tread. I functioned on the theory that I’m pure of heart. And how careful can you be? If you’re too careful you don’t do anything.”

Biaggi hopes his epitaph will read, quote: “He cared.”

If the turnout and testimonials at his birthday party are any clue, former constituents and colleagues also still care a great deal about him.

Living well may be the best revenge. Surviving isn’t so bad, either. After a roller-coaster career, just being alive at the age of 90 may be vindication enough.
