To the Editor:

Paul Ulrich's concern (letter, Jan. 28) about the source of Justice White's quotation in the opinion having to do with searching students in school could have been eased by reference to the opinion itself. There it is clear that the quotation (''although 'both the concept of probable cause and the requirement of a warrant bear on the reasonableness of a search . . . in certain limited circumstances neither is required.' '') comes from Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr.'s concurrence in the 1973 decision Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U.S. 266. It is unfortunate if the published excerpt of the opinion gave the impression that the quotation was unattributed.
