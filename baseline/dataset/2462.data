Rabbi Balfour Brickner, a voice of Reform Judaism on issues like race and abortion and the rabbi emeritus of the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue in Manhattan, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 78 and lived in Fort Lee, N.J., and Stockbridge, Mass.

His death was announced to the congregation, which he had served as senior rabbi from 1980 until he reached emeritus status in 1992, by Senior Rabbi Ammiel Hirsch. The cause was given as lung cancer. At his death he was also executive director of the Engelberg Foundation.

Balfour Brickner was a rabbi for more than half a century and a noted activist. He took part in the civil rights struggle and the Vietnam antiwar movement and was a founder of Religious Leaders for a Free Choice, a New York group supporting a woman's right to choose abortion.

He was jailed while demonstrating for voting rights in the South in the 1960's. He became a Zionist as a teenager, but, recognizing the plight of Palestinians, he warned against Israeli expansionism in the protracted Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
