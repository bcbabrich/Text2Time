Seeking to broaden its reach in the consumer market, Sun Microsystems Inc. said today that it would acquire Diba Inc., a start-up company that is developing technology for small communications and computing devices called information appliances.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The acquisition by Sun follows close on the heels of the Microsoft Corporation's acquisition of Web TV and the Oracle Corporation's acquisition of Navio Inc. for its Network Computer Inc. subsidiary. All three acquisitions illustrate the importance the major computer companies are placing on the convergence of the Internet and television. With Diba, which was founded to create technology for simple devices that could surf the World Wide Web or send electronic mail, Sun is staking its claim on this emerging market.

''There is going to be a realigning of the television world in the next five years,'' said William Bluestein, an analyst with Forrester Research. ''Whether it's Web TV, HDTV or our old friend 500 channels, you're going to see a whole new assault on the television as a platform, so you see all the computer guys circling around. This is essentially a move made by Sun to give it an entree in that world.''

Diba will become a new Sun business unit, the Consumer Technologies Group, within the company's microelectronics division. This group will work with major consumer electronics companies, so-called O.E.M.'s, to provide technologies for building consumer products such as Internet-enabled TV's, set top and satellite boxes, and smart phones, said Sun, which is based in Mountain View, Calif. Diba employs 79 people and is based in Menlo Park, Calif.
