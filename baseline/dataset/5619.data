''Instead of using their individual assets to secure the loan, they chose to burden the Placid Oil Company and the Hunt trusts with the obligation to pay their personal debts,'' the bank said. The bank concluded that the Hunts ''have rendered themselves personally liable'' to repay the loans to Placid and Penrod.

The Bank of America sued the Hunt brothers, their trustees and Penrod to recover overdue loans totaling more than $76 million. The largest lawsuit against the Hunts filed by one of its lenders was by the First National Bank of Chicago. Listing by First Chicago

First Chicago said it was seeking to recover $100 million in loans to Penrod, $90 million in loans to two companies placed into bankruptcy by the Hunts in 1982, the Hunt International Resources Corporation and a subsidiary, Great Western Sugar, and $25 million it lost by participating in foreign exchange transactions with the Hunts. First Chicago said it wanted $220 million in additional damages.

The 10 major lenders to Placid Oil, each of which holds loans of $53.9 million, include Bankers Trust, Bank of Montreal, Citibank, First City National Bank of Houston, Republicbank-Dallas, First Interstate Bank of California, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, Mellon Bank, Security Pacific National Bank and Texas Commerce Bank. Eight other banks have loans to Placid ranging from $27.6 million to $40.7 million.

A bankruptcy lawyer not involved in the case, Martin I. Klein, said other creditors soon might act to seize collateral offered by the Hunts in other business transactions. That, in turn, is likely to provoke the Hunts to place other assets under the shield of bankruptcy courts, he added. ''The bankruptcy of Placid Oil may trigger other bankruptcies with other creditors,'' Mr. Klein said. He added that the banks also could ask the bankruptcy court for permission to move ahead with the foreclosures blocked in the Chapter 11 filings, although approval typically is uncertain. 'Extraordinarily Difficult'

Mr. McCabe, the Hunt lawyer, said he saw no prospect for a continuing string of foreclosures by his clients. As for the banks' intention to pursue Hunt assets not formally pledged as collateral for loans to Placid and Penrod, ''it would be extraordinarily difficult'' to achieve, Mr. McCabe said.

The Bank of America, and other Hunt lenders, in arguing that the Hunts used Placid and Penrod as vehicles to rescue them from losses in silver trading, are employing the legal principle known as ''alter ego.'' Mr. Klein said it was ''a long-shot approach'' and difficult to prove.
