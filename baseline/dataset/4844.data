Despite the well-deserved praise for President Bush's initiative to reduce nuclear arms, two sentences in his address indicate that the U.S. still clings to a mistaken belief that has distorted its defense policy throughout the nuclear age.

This is the belief that, beyond possessing nuclear weapons in order to deter the use of such weapons by other countries, the U.S. must rely on the threat of using them in order to deter conventional attacks.

The key sentences in the Bush address were these: "We will, of course, insure that we preserve an effective air-delivered nuclear capability in Europe. That's essential to NATO's security." This language means that, despite the revolution in world politics, President Bush asserts that the U.S. still reserves the right to use nuclear weapons first in Europe. But against what threats, and from whom? Why does he think weapons of mass destruction are necessary to deal with the danger (if any) of conventional war?

The reliance on nuclear threats to deter conventional attacks lacks any credibility it may have had. It also hinders reductions in U.S. defense spending and inhibits international efforts at nuclear nonproliferation.
