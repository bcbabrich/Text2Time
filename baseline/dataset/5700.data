In another step toward liquidation, the board of the Des Moines Register and Tribune Company today approved the sale of four radio stations for $11.6 million.

Ackerley Communications Inc. of Seattle will acquire KSGO-AM and FM in Portland, Ore., for $6 million and the Price Communications Corporation of New York will buy WIBA- AM and FM in Madison, Wis., for approximately $5.6 million.

With the sale of the four stations, the company will have disposed of $290 million of assets.

But the board made no decision on the disposal of the Register and Tribune's 430,000 shares - representing 14.3 percent ownership - of the Cowles Media Company, whose holdings include the Minneapolis Star and Tribune and other smaller papers.

The Cowles stock is the Register and Tribune's only significant asset that has not been sold, and its value is thought to depend largely upon whether it is sold as a block or dispersed to shareholders. Cowles stock, which is traded through broker transactions though the company is private, has recently sold for $80 a share, according to Robert Gales of Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood, a brokerage firm in Minneapolis.
