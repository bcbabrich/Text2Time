A 47-year-old man bled to death in his Manhattan apartment early yesterday after he knocked over a fish tank and cut his arm on the broken glass, the police said.

According to the police, the man, Antonio Perez, was drinking with his girlfriend and two friends about 1:30 a.m. at his apartment at 3150 Broadway in Washington Heights when he lost his balance and stumbled into his fish tank. The tank, full of fish and water, fell and shattered, and an artery in Mr. Perez's right arm was severed by broken glass, said Officer Dennis Laffin, a police spokesman. "It's a straight-up accident," Officer Laffin said.

Mr. Perez's friends called 911, and he was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, where he was pronounced dead, Officer Laffin said.
