A Promise of Stability

SCO was responsible for licensing and monitoring Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu, and judged him to be dependable, even “exemplary,” as one longtime case worker for the organization described him in a review, according to the official who discussed the state register and who was briefed on documents that SCO has provided to child welfare authorities in recent weeks.

A former wine distributor who became a full-time foster parent, Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu filed for bankruptcy three years ago. In the court filing, he listed his job as “Home Care Provider (Foster Care)” with an income of $6,600 a month and assets that included a couple of classic cars: an MG Roadster and a Plymouth Savoy. SCO continued to place children with him throughout his financial difficulties and reliance on foster care stipends as his primary source of income.

Indeed, his home was always in demand. He was certified as a “therapeutic” foster parent, deemed qualified to care for children with complex emotional needs. Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu was a single, Latino man with a large house at the bottom of a suburban cul-de-sac, and most of the children sent to him were also Latino. For social services agencies struggling to place vulnerable boys, Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu’s profile seemed a perfect fit, especially because of his willingness to take in so many boys, most of them with emotional or developmental challenges.

For many of the children, who may have felt abandoned by their biological parents and had moved between homes, Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu promised a stability they had never known. But investigators have found that he isolated the boys from the outside world and imposed rigid limits on their lives, said Detective Lt. Robert Donohue, commander of the Suffolk County Police Department’s Special Victims Section.

The boys, for example, were forbidden to join after-school clubs, play team sports or have girlfriends, Lieutenant Donohue said. “It’s clear to me that he exercised this control over their lives in order to commit the atrocities which he did,” he said.

The biological father of one of the boys whom Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu adopted said he was shocked to learn, after he and his son reunited, that Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu had not only adopted his son and changed the boy’s surname, but had also changed his given name. It was, the authorities said, a step he took with other children he adopted.
