The dress is back. Oh, some women have always worn them. But not since the ubiquitous Courreges shift of the 60's has the dress made such a strong fashion statement.

In the 1970's the popularity of the pants suit led to the dominance of sportswear, and then to the suit for women aspiring to a businesslike image. Now those same women have discovered that the right dress can go from board room to dinner date.

One sure sign of the new importance of dresses is that sportswear companies are setting up dress divisions. Count among these Liz Claiborne, Adrienne Vittadini, Ellen Tracy, Cathy Hardwick, Mary Ann Restivo and Anne Klein. All have shown a few dresses for years, but not enough to meet the new demand.

''We've always done well with dresses in our sportswear line,'' Ms. Restivo said, ''and people kept asking us for more.'' Those in department stores ''tended to be doctored up with everything in the world,'' she said, adding: ''Ours are more understated. They're simple, so they can be worn for a lot of occasions.''
