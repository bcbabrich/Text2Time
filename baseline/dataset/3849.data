A Federal law intended to restrict paroles for violent felons has become a stumbling block in state budget negotiations, with Gov. George E. Pataki and the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, trading accusations of dishonesty and competing interpretations of the law.

Strictly speaking, it is not a budget matter. The state stands to lose $24 million this year in Federal aid for prison construction if it does not comply with Federal parole guidelines passed last year that require violent offenders to serve, on average, at least 85 percent of their sentences. But that is a pittance next to the $635 million the Governor wants to spend this year on new prison space, let alone the $66 billion budget. State officials say New York has until Tuesday night to apply for the Federal grant.

Nor is it, strictly speaking, a matter of how much time prisoners serve. A state with prisoners serving relatively short sentences can qualify for the Federal grant if it denies all paroles, while another state that grants paroles might not qualify, even if its prisoners serve longer terms.

Mr. Pataki, a Republican, insists that the state has not met the Federal standard, and that it ought to deny parole to all first-time violent felons. Mr. Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan, says he believes that the state qualifies. And the Justice Department says the answer is unclear.
