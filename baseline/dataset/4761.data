Stan Gelbaugh threw for 326 yards and hit a 61-yard scoring pass to Andre Riley as the London Monarchs won their World League of American Football home opener, 22-18, today over the New York/New Jersey Knights before 46,952 fans at Wembley Stadium.

Gelbaugh overcame a shaky first half in which he threw three interceptions and repeatedly underthrew receivers. He finished with 24 completions in 40 attempts.

The Monarchs (2-0) fell behind in the opening minutes against the Knights' run-and-shoot offense but used their superior bulk and strength to wear down the visitors and score 19 points in the third quarter.

The Knights (0-2) scored on their first series. Running back Eric Wilkerson went 74 yards to the 1-yard on the third play of the game and quarterback Jeff Graham scored two plays later on a keeper.
