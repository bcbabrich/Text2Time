MOST businesses like to flaunt it when they meet their revenue and profit goals.

Seventh Generation Inc., a public spirited mail-order company in Colchester, Vt., keeps score by a different set of yardsticks.

The company estimates that since 1989, its environmentally sensitive paper products, trash bags and other wares have prevented 29,000 trees from being cut down, saved nearly 500 million gallons of water, and kept more than 33,000 cubic feet of solid waste out of the country's landfills. The company derives its name from an Iroquois saying that one should consider the consequences of any action on at least seven generations to come.

"Seventh Generation produced the green catalogue, par excellence," said Carl Frankel, the publisher of Green Market Alert, a trade publication in Bethlehem, Conn. Green is generally used to designate an item as environmentally sensitive.

Still, Seventh Generation has had trouble mastering the more conventional art of making money, a serious obstacle now that it has designs on going public. The company has stumbled into a financial quagmire, incurring "significant losses," by its own description, in each year of operation.
