“An Al Jazeera cameraman held at the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay for six years without charge has been released, the network said on Thursday,” Reuters reports.

Wadah Khanfar, Al Jazeera’s director general who is in Khartoum to welcome Haj, accused the U.S. military of urging the cameraman to spy on the operations at the network.

“We are concerned about the way the Americans dealt with Sami, and we are concerned about the way they could deal with others as well,” he said in a report on the Al Jazeera website. “Sami will continue with Al Jazeera.”
