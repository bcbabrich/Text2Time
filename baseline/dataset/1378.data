Apple posted information on its Web site Monday that offers more details about the company’s upcoming iCloud software which will sync customers content between multiple devices.

iCloud, which is expected to begin this fall, will allow Apple customers to share their books, music and photos between multiple computers and mobile devices, including an iPhone and desktop computer. The company will also back up this content in the cloud.

Apple said that customers would be given 5 gigabytes of storage for free. Customers needing more space will be able to purchase additional storage in yearly chunks. Ten gigabytes of additional space will cost $20 a year, 20 gigabytes will cost $40 and 50 gigabytes will cost $100, the company said.

But don’t worry about having to shell out more money to Apple. Most customers will not need to upgrade. Apple noted on its Web site that applications, books and music, will not count against the 5 gigabytes of free storage. Mail, iWork documents, photos and account settings will count towards the iCloud storage. A user could expect to store more than 1,000 photos at no cost.

Apple also activated the iCloud.com Web site on Monday. The site is currently being used for Apple developers to start building third-party applications using the iCloud application programming interface, or A.P.I.
