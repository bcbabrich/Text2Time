BECKET, Mass. — This weekend in the Berkshires you can see the percussive dances of Argentine cowboys and, a short walk away, contemporary dance from South Korea.

It’s just a typical few days at Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival, which welcomes dance from around the world to its idyllic campus in the woods. As the festival’s new director, Pamela Tatge, said in a recent curtain speech, at a time when walls are going up between nations (or threatening to), the Pillow’s borders are wide open.

The Seoul-based Bereishit Dance Company, which performed on Thursday in the Doris Duke Theater here, offers its own study in border-crossing. The troupe’s name is a Hebrew word, the first one in Genesis (“in the beginning”), though the company pronounces it BRESH-it (rather than the Hebrew ber-ay-SHEET).

And there appear to be some Israeli influences in the work of the director, Soon-ho Park, who studied in Seoul and the Netherlands, among other places. A dancer doesn’t need to train in Israel these days to absorb that country’s biggest dance export, Gaga, a form developed by the choreographer Ohad Naharin and now taught internationally.
