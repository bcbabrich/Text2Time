Belmont Park will open its fall season this afternoon but one of the stars of the cast won't be there: Julie Krone, who suffered multiple fractures of the right ankle and severe cuts on the left elbow in a violent spill Monday on Saratoga's final day.

The 30-year-old jockey, who ran second to Mike Smith for the riding title at Saratoga, was transferred yesterday from Saratoga Hospital to the Staten Island University Hospital nearer her home in Colts Neck, N.J. She was listed in good condition after a surgical procedure was performed Monday night to stabilize the ankle joint, alleviate pain and splint the punctured left elbow.

Krone was flown late yesterday afternoon from Saratoga to New York and taken by ambulance to the Staten Island hospital and placed in the care of Dr. Frank Ariosta, an orthopedic surgeon, who will perform further surgery to repair the ankle.

Officials at Saratoga Hospital said that it was premature to gauge the impact of the injuries on Krone's career. But last night, Brian Morris, a spokesman for the Staten Island hospital, said, "She won't be able to walk for three months, but could be able to ride within six months." He added that because jockeys are subjected to less foot stress than other athletes, Krone should be able to continue her career, which already includes riding titles at Belmont Park, Monmouth Park, Atlantic City and the Meadowlands. She also became the first woman to win any of the Triple Crown races when she rode Colonial Affair to victory in the Belmont Stakes in June.
