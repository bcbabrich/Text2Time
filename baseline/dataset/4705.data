To Sir Colin, a medium-sized man with light brown hair and an easy, jocular mannner, the fact that the Federal agency has set a deadline for comment bodes well, since Transportation Secretary Andrew H. Card can then make a decision.

Mr. Card has said he will decide before President-elect Bill Clinton takes office. He has also said there are strong reasons to allow the investment.

For one, he and others say, it would strenghten USAir financially and help secure the jobs of 47,000 American workers. It would also send a strong signal that the United States welcomes foreign investment in domestic companies.

On the other hand, Mr. Card has also pushed the British hard in talks to let American carriers have similar rights to invest in British carriers. He has also sought what are called beyond rights, or the ability of American carriers to fly beyond major hubs like London.

All four major United States carriers have said that they will go along with the British Airways investment in USAir if they get reciprocal rights. Sir Colin argues that his airline's deal should not be linked to granting United States carriers more rights in Britain. He said the proposal conformed to American laws and should be decided on its merits.

Once the deal is made, he argues, Britain is prepared to negotiate a much greater liberalization over the next year, a process that will take time, since Congress and the Clinton Administration would have to approve the new terms. Negotiators' Stance

But negotiators for the American side say that such a strategy would mean giving up their most valuable chip and that they would have to rely on the good will of the British to open their market.
