A new political skirmish broke out in the Senate today, again delaying a vote on midyear budget cuts and prompting an exasperated majority leader, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, to threaten political war against the White House.

"We're not bringing up any more bills that the White House wants until we have some understanding on the legislation that we thought would go through here in a normal way," Mr. Dole said, suggesting that President Clinton was orchestrating Democratic efforts to slow work in the Senate. "If the President doesn't care, that's good enough for me. If he doesn't want this legislation, we're not going to take it up. But neither are we going to take up legislation that he wants."

As Mr. Dole issued his warning, Mr. Clinton fired off a letter from Haiti, where he spent the day, chiding the majority leader for not having passed legislation that would give the military $2.5 billion in an emergency appropriation to cover the costs of operations in Haiti, Somalia and elsewhere.

But any hopes of a quick vote on that bill or the separate midyear budget cuts were further dimmed when a partisan fight erupted over taxation of multimillionaires who are expatriates.
