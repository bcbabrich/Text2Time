A 19-year-old student was shot and critically wounded during a dispute outside an alternative high school in lower Manhattan yesterday, the police said.

The victim, Cornelius Ray, was shot once in the chest about 12:30 P.M. on the steps of City-as-School, which houses three specialized high school programs in its building at 16 Clarkson Street in the West Village. It was not known whether the gunman, described as an 18-year-old man wearing a black jacket with a red design, was a student at the school, said Officer Martin Foley, a police spokesman.

The gunman escaped. Mr. Ray, a resident of the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, was taken to St. Vincent's Hospital, where he was in critical but stable condition after undergoing surgery. Jayne Greene, a hospital spokeswoman, said doctors said Mr. Ray was doing well.

Karen Crowe, a spokeswoman for the Board of Education, said Mr. Ray was enrolled in the Lower Manhattan Outreach Project, a program for students older than 16 1/2 who had dropped out of school or were at risk of dropping out.
