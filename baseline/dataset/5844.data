Lifeblood of Trade

Commercial letters of credit are the lifeblood of the international trade system. They are so widely accepted that they have been used for ransom payments in addition to their function in trade. The rules governing their use are written by the International Chamber of Commerce as the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits. The new set of rules has been adopted as UCP 400.

In long-distance trade, a buyer may be reluctant to pay for goods that have not been received or inspected, and a seller may not wish to ship the goods before receiving payment. The letter of credit uses banks as intermediaries to reconcile the interests of both parties.

The LC, as it is called, is a binding agreement specifying precisely what is to be shipped, how much is to be paid and when, and other conditions of the transaction. It also guarantees the exporter that the money to pay for the shipment is available.

Usually, two banks are involved. The first issues the letter for the importer. The second, or advising bank, confirms that the terms have been met and often receives the payment for the exporter.

Lucrative Business for Banks

A fee ranging from about one- eighth percent to one-fourth percent of the face value of the LC is charged by the issuing bank. Additional fees are charged for processing the documents, confirming their terms and amending the letter if necessary. Writing letters of credit is a low-risk but lucrative ''bread-and-butter'' business for banks.
