A visit to one of this restaurant's tatami rooms is like a quick trip to Japan. Here some of the most exquisite kaiseki cuisine can be experienced in a serene atmosphere. Kaiseki cuisine, associated with the tea ceremony, is food for the soul as well as the body, meant to feed the eye with its beauty and the spirit with its meaning. The courses follow a strict order, and the way to enjoy this is to abandon yourself to the experience, appreciating the peace, the subtlety of the flavors and the sense that you are being pampered as never before.

This opulent Midtown sake bar, hidden in a basement, offers about 200 varieties of sake and a small menu of well-prepared food. The elegant but casual room is a beautiful golden color, with filtered golden light and blond wood chairs with almost silken surfaces. Most of the clientele is Japanese, with business executives early in the evening and couples arriving later.

Shabu-Tatsu specializes in yakiniku, sukiyaki and shabu shabu, dishes that are cooked on circular metal grills set over burners in the center of each table. Yakiniku dishes are cooked directly on the grill. Trays of meat ranging from tissue-thin slices of rib-eye to tripe arrive, and after a brief grilling you use chopsticks to dip the meat in sweet soy or sesame sauce and eat. Delicious! Shabu shabu and sukiyaki dishes are simmered in pans of broth or water. Shabu shabu is easy. Pick up the beef with chopsticks, swirl briefly in the boiling broth, dip and eat. Sukiyaki is a little more complicated, but the attentive staff is happy to help. Another branch of Shabu-Tatsu is at 1414 York Avenue, at 75th Street.

Soba-Ya specializes in soba, the buckwheat noodles for which the Japanese have an almost mystical reverence. But Soba-Ya also offers some sensational appetizer specials and small delicacies, like cooked spinach marinated in soy and rice wine and sprinkled with sesame seeds. The soba noodles, pale tan and smooth, are served hot in soups or cold with a cool dipping sauce made of soy, dashi and rice wine. When you have slurped your last noodle, a waitress will arrive with a steaming pitcher full of the cooking water from the noodle pot. She pours it into the remaining dipping sauce, creating a mild, pleasant broth that puts a warm finishing touch on the meal.

The food is so extraordinary at this tiny restaurant that a visit feels like a dreamy voyage to Japan. The chef and owner, Nao Sugiyama, serves modern kaiseki meals: you tell the chef how many courses you want (5 to 14) and how much you are willing to spend, and simply put yourself in his hands. This artful food makes no concessions to American prejudices. Splendid sushi is a part of each meal, but there are often tiny crabs no larger than a fingernail (you pop the whole creature into your mouth), lily roots and ginger buds. The meal often begins with ankimo, the smooth Japanese version of foie gras (actually monkfish liver), served with a tiny wooden spoon. Most meals continue with zensai, beautiful little appetizers arranged with great delicacy, then an assortment of sashimi, then perhaps rich, decadent black cod marinated in sake lees. The meal invariably closes with miso soup, pickles and rice.

Entering Toraya is like stepping into a hushed and peaceful Japanese temple. Quiet music creates a tranquil mood, and flower arrangements provide little bursts of color against the patterned granite and tile walls. This tea salon has a menu of unusual Japanese dishes, but the highlights are the beautiful, meticulously fashioned pastries, like zangetsu, a soft ginger-flavored pancake folded over a filling of sweetened azuki bean paste, etched with a pattern of chrysanthemum petals. The zangetsu and other pastries are delicate, delicious and unforgettable.
