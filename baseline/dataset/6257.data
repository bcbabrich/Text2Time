LAKE APASTEPEQUE, El Salvador, Sept. 25—American scientists have entered the final stages of research that they feel may lead to the virtual elimination of malaria as a major world health problem.

Without using insecticides, the scientists reduced by 99 per cent malaria‐carrying Anopheles mosquitoes this 100‐acre lake and in the 5.4 square miles of valley around it. They are now looking for a site in Central America to conduct an operational trial in an area of 50 square miles.

Using a chemical agent developed by the United States Government and known only as Ent ‐ 61585, the scientists sterilized 4.5 million male Anopheles mosquitoes, released them here and recorded the 99 per cent reduction during five months last year.

The scientists are affiliated with the Public Health Service's Central America research station in San Salvador, just 37 miles from Lake Apaste peque. The research is being conducted in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture and with the cooperation of the Government of El Salvador, which has provided the research station with laboratory space at no cost.
