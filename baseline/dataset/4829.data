In bringing on a couple identified as Nelson and Winnie Mandela, the movie seemed to promise that these pooh-bahs were in for it, too -- and at least one of them is eminently vulnerable. But no. Mrs. Mandela's association with youths who apparently went in for blood sports was not mentioned. And there was no gag about Mr. Mandela being henpecked.

The Mandelas are protected by race, as humor-proof a vest as is available these days. It takes a target like the Rev. Al Sharpton to bring out the darts of ridicule. One of the few funny spots in the messy movie version of "The Bonfire of the Vanities" was the appearance of a portly, gussied-up rabble-rouser whose resemblance to the Reverend Sharpton was sheer, cathartic ridicule. At the moment heavy indignation is being directed at Dr. Leonard Jeffries Jr., the chairman of the African-American studies department at City College, for his unflattering remarks about Jews, Italians and whites in general. But demands for his demotion endow him with seriousness. For the thoroughgoing ridiculist, nobody is all that serious, and here, if anywhere, is a figure whose theories might easily be grist for mockery, but never in prime time.

The number of excluded subjects continues to grow. On the tube these days all groups are taken pretty much at their own estimate; more and more subjects are handled with a tenderness that can bring on queasiness.

Granted, there is nothing funny about abortion, rape, AIDS, homelessness or the Holocaust, but should that exempt activists on all sides from ridicule? And do all programs on those subjects -- and there are many -- have to be so holier than thou? Each exhalation of Elie Wiesel is received by interviewers as coming from Moses on the mountain. Even to make such an observation opens one to a charges of gross insensitivity to a 20th-century tragedy, but can't one differentiate between the fact of the Holocaust and its exploitation?

Isn't there something worth ridiculing in the way public television, that fount of responsibility, treats Indians, pro-choicers and all other politically correct groups with the same reverence that it gives to whales.

Beware. When Joseph Epstein, the editor of The American Scholar, was exposed as having made rude jokes about feminists and lesbians, Joyce Carol Oates demanded his resignation. (The jokes were written for The Hudson Review, a publication presumably read by sophisticated people; hearing them uttered on television is unimaginable.)

To mock truly divisive issues and exquisitely sensitive groups requires a respect for the maturity of the mass audience that has never been earned, or at least a hope that the level of maturity might be raised -- and who wants to take a chance on that? So the medium can be expected to tread carefully, avoid offense and so make its contribution to public order and even to good feelings. The gain is by no means negligible, but the price is a humorless leveling of political discourse. The loss can be measured in the light and the light-heartedness that ridicule might bring to a dreary political time.
