After four hard‐driving years as prosecutor in the Bronx, former District Attorney Burton B. Roberts donned the robes of a State Supreme Court justice in Manhattan yesterday, showing no let‐up in his zeal for action.

The fiery red‐haired prosecutor, who was always ready to go to trial with one case or another—of ten big ones —had become the judge with the same idea—“Let's go to trial.”

Facing a light calendar on the first day of his 14‐year term, he could have finished his work in 15 minutes. Instead, he had his aides “search around the other courtrooms for a case ready for trial” and succeeded in having a rape case switched over to his part by midafternoon.

By 3 P.M. Justice Roberts was in his element, instructing a jury.

In the massive building at 100 Centre Street, which is usually characterized by the dungeon‐like somberness of its courtrooms, a flash of sunlight literally spotlighted the new justice as he told the jury:

“While I'm the judge of the law, you folks truly are judges, too. You and you alone are judges of the facts.”
