Rita Lynn, an actress in radio and television who also helped develop the use of theatrical performances as therapy for psychiatric patients, died on Jan. 21 at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 74.

The cause was cancer, said her husband, Frank Maxwell.

Ms. Lynn was best known for her work in television. Starting in the 1950's, she appeared in a wide variety of roles on shows that included "Omnibus," "Playhouse 90," "The Phil Silvers Show," "Perry Mason," "The Streets of San Francisco" and "Maverick." She also had recurring roles on the soap operas "Search for Tomorrow" and "General Hospital." In radio, hers was a familiar voice in countless dramas.

Mq. Lynn's work as a volunteer nurse's aide at the Neuropsychiatric Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles in the 1950's led her to propose a program of theatrical therapy. When the program was accepted, she spent five years producing and directing one-act plays with the institute's patients. She was asked to act as a consultant to other hospitals seeking to develop similar programs.

In addition to her husband, she is survived by children from two previous marriages: a son, Arthur Debernarde of Minneapolis, and a daughter, Donna Maria Lynn of Westport, Conn.; a stepdaughter, Chris Maxwell of Los Angeles, and five grandchildren.
