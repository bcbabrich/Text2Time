The New York State Power Authority, seeking major improvements at the nuclear plants it operates in Westchester County and on the shore of Lake Ontario, said yesterday that it planned to hire a New Orleans company to manage the plants.

Under a preliminary agreement, power authority officials said the Entergy Corporation, which has won the nuclear industry's praise for its management of five plants in the South, would take over the Indian Point 3 plant in Buchanan and the James A. Fitzpatrick plant in Scriba under a five-year contract.

Officials said details of the management contract, including how much Entergy would be paid and how many of the power authority's workers would be cut, remained to be determined, pending an analysis by Entergy of the operations at the two plants. The plan requires the approval of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

At a news conference, senior executives of the power authority said the private management proposal, untested anywhere else, was necessary because of both the poor performance at Fitzpatrick and Indian Point 3, and the heightened demands expected with deregulation of the electrical utility industry.
