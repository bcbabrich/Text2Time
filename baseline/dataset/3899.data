The three-day symposium, which has been meeting in private since Thursday, is part of what Pope John Paul today called a general ''examination of conscience'' that is necessary as Christianity prepares to celebrate its third millennium. Its purpose, which is more theological than historical, is to examine Christian thought for prejudice against Judaism, as well as against Jews.

In the text of the Pope's comments made public by the Vatican, John Paul joined other Roman Catholic theologians in acknowledging that by blaming the Jews for the death of Jesus, certain Christian teachings had helped fuel anti-Semitism.

''In the Christian world -- I do not say on the part of the church as such -- the wrong and unjust interpretations of the New Testament relating to the Jewish people and their presumed guilt circulated for too long, contributing to feeling of hostility toward these people,'' he said.

''These contributed to soothing consciences,'' the Pope said, ''to the point that when a wave of persecutions swept Europe fueled by a pagan anti-Semitism -- which in its essence was equal to anti-Christianism -- next to those Christians who did everything to save the persecuted at the risk of their own lives, the spiritual resistance of many was not that which humanity expected from the disciples of Christ.''

During the 19 years of his pontificate, John Paul has made significant progress in improving relations between the the Catholic Church and Jews. Today, he again emphasized the common heritage that binds Christians and Jews. Those who consider Jesus' Jewish heritage as a ''simple cultural accident,'' he said, do a disservice to history and to Christianity.
