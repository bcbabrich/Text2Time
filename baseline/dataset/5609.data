In the fall of 1974, a funny thing happened on the Harvard campus. A scout representing a National Football League combine was seen walking through the square. N.F.L. scouts don't normally appear on Ivy League campuses. Was he confused? Was he lost? In fact, he had come to test Pat McInally, a Harvard senior. The scout carried a standard list of questions that is given to all potential draftees, and he would administer it to McInally, a wide receiver and punter.

Now, the Harvard football program had described McInally as ''a 6-6, 210-pound marionette, who looks as though he were strung together by some football-crazed Gepetto. (He will break) from the Harvard huddle and toddle off to the sideline with his wooden, herky-jerky gait. The pumping of his long, bowed legs will cause his shoulders to jiggle at crazy angles.

''The shirt-tail of his crimson jersey will be dangling, and the stockings, pulled tight and taped, will still leave three inches of shin exposed. The helmet will be askew.'' Forget appearances. He was fast, he had slippery moves, he was sure-handed and he nabbed enough passes that he was a consensus all-American.

It had been determined that, physically, McInally was pro football material. But mentally? Sure, he was an excellent student who would soon be earning a degree in American history. Yet the question remained: Could he pass the rigid N.F.L. intellectual requirements?
