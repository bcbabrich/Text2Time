Silver Beach is a waterside ‘community tucked into the eastern tip of the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx where residents seem satisfied—with apparent justification—that they have found an ideal way to preserve and improve their neighborhood.

They bought it.

While the 452 single‐family homes in Silver Beach have long been privately owned, the land they occupied had been owned, since 1921 by a family‐run real‐estate company. The home owners paid ground rent for the jots.

Three years ago this month, the residents formed a cooperative and bought—for $1.6 million—the 50 acres on which their homes are built. 36 adjacent acres that extend under water into the East River, two miles of paths, three miles of roads, nine generally rundown commercial buildings, seven of them vacant, and a used and ramshackle firehouse.

Three years after the undertaking, the residents seem content that they have firm control of their neighborhood's future. The complaints heard in other communities over reduced city services and other problems seem hard to come by in *Silver Beach.
