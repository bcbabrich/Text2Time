WASHINGTON, March 1—The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether appeals court judges who are reviewing obscenity convictions must themselves look at the alleged]y obscene materials before they rule.

The Court took up the question at the behest of three individuals and two corporations convicted in the United States District Court in Kentucky of transporting in interstate commerce a series of “obscene, lewd, lascivious and filthy films and film previews” including “Deep Throat.”

The defendants first appealed their convictions to the United States Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit, but that court, by vote of 2 to 1, upheld the lower court without loking at any of the movies.

The films were all “lodged with the court as exhibits,” the one dissenting judge noted in his opinion, but he said “the majority of the panel decided that an examination of them was not necessary.”
