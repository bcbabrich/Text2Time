Fay's Inc., a drug-store chain in New York and Pennsylvania, has said that its president and chief operating officer, Lawrence J. Rose, has resigned to pursue other interests.

Henry A. Panasci Jr., chairman and chief executive, said yesterday that he would assume Mr. Rose's duties until a successor was named.

Mr. Panasci, who is 62, declined to elaborate on Mr. Rose's decision other than to say that "succession is not a part of this at all."

Mr. Rose, 49, has been with Fay's three years. He replaced Daniel A. Herrmann, who also resigned as president for personal reasons.
