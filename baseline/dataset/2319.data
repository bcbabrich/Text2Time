Marie Rose Dorismond took a 28-hour bus trip to New York City to attend the wake and funeral for Sean Bell, the 23-year-old killed in a police shooting last weekend, Sarah Kershaw reports tonight.



Mrs. Dorismond’s only son, Patrick, was killed at 26 by New York police in 2000. She was here to make herself available to the Bell family, people she had never met, and she also rejoined what has become an anguished club of relatives torn apart by police killings.

Inside the crowded church in Jamaica, Queens, Mrs. Dorismond was weeping in the second row of pews, only a few feet from the open coffin, when Amadou Diallo’s mother, Kadiatou, arrived. Mrs. Dorismond rushed to her friend, the two hugged for several minutes, and Mrs. Dorismond shouted: “Again? Again? Again?”

The funeral drew hundreds of mourners and protesters. Photos
