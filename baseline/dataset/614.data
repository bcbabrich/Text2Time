Men may not like to discuss bronzing creams and self-tanners, but that doesn’t mean they don’t use them.

“It’s bizarre,” said Dominick D’Erasmo, 41, a marketing sales executive in Manhattan, “but it’s just uncomfortable to talk about anything related to tanning.”

Mr. D’Erasmo said his favorite product in this department is Clinique for Men Face Bronzer. “I’m Italian,” he said. “I look the best with burnt olive skin, but I had to stop with the tanning bed. This is the safer version.” He added that he likes the Clinique bronzing cream because it has no chemical odor and the color isn’t too dark.

Tom Ford, the designer, film director and creator of a namesake fashion label, said he created Tom Ford Men’s Bronzing Gel for his own use. “I use a bronzer every single day,” he said, “and I had been searching for something that was high quality and masculine at the same time.”
