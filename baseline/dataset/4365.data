To the Editor:

Your film reviewer refers to a gang rape in "The Shawshank Redemption" as "homosexual rape" (Sept. 23). Prisoner rape is an outrage perpetrated by heterosexuals, usually on heterosexual victims. To call it "homosexual" rape gratuitously insults homosexuals and misleads the public about a horrifying practice for more than 300,000 men and boys a year. If reviewers need to warn viewers that the rape alluded to involves one gender only, "male rape" or "prison rape" would be sufficient.
