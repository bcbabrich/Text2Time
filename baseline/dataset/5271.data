Unusually spirited and rythmically alert Bach playing was the unifying thread of a stimulating organ recital by Kei Koito at the Church of St. John the Evangelist Monday evening.

Miss Koito played four works of the Thomaskantor - an early Vivaldi concerto transcription (BWV 593), the canonic variations on ''Vom Himmel hoch'' (BWV 769), the Trio Sonata in C minor (BWV 526) and the Prelude and Fugue in E flat (BWV 552) - with brilliant contrasts of registration (almost, but never quite, gaudy) and with a motoric swing that sometimes called to mind the Bach interpretations of Glenn Gould. Miss Koito is by no means alone in her application of a lean, often non legato style to these works, but her presentation of it was particularly fresh.

She played the adagio of the Vivaldi arrangement with a blunt, measured tread and hollow timbres; the variations brought singing fluency and deft ornamentation. The big final piece began with majestic pacing but in a way that remained relatively brisk and bright; the fugue was begun in severe colors that gave way to a sort of crescendo of registrational variety.

Interspersed with the Bach were three new pieces, all of them announced as New York premieres. Henri Pousseur's ''Deuxieme Vue sur les Jardins Interdits'' explored contrasts of timbre and confrontations of dissonance with pastiche consonance; it seemed limited by a stop-and-go character. Episodic construction, though, did not undermine the charm of Eric Gaudibert's ''Jetees,'' a partly aleatory work of great variety; my favorite section was one in which pretty, tweety high beepings cavorted with an Alberich-like bassoon stop below. Giacinto Scelsi's ''In Nomine Lucis'' built wild-sounding tone clusters into a vague, chaotic climax and dwindled; it sounded primitive but stirring.
