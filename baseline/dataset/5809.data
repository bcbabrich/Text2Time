BEAR VAN ASCH VAN WYCK is a man of many roles. To begin with, he says he is a Dutch baron, a title he inherited from his maternal grandfather. He is also an artist, a teacher, a dealer of English antiques, and a budding breeder of English springer spaniels.

This fall he took on a new role: as a freelance caretaker who serves wealthy New Yorkers with country homes in western Connecticut.

''People want reassurance, peace of mind,'' Mr. van Wyck said. ''Their homes are near and dear to them and our service takes the edge off it, takes all the little hassles out of owning a second home.''

''Country Caretakers'' - the business he began recently with his wife, Susan, who like her husband sketches with charcoals - offers its clients a variety of services, from preparing a home for a weekend stay to looking after a house through the winter.
