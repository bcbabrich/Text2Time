Seattle is an espresso town, which may be why Sam Perkins has finally awakened.

Predictably nicknamed "Sleepy," because he always walks around as if it's 4 A.M., Perkins has turned into the SuperSonics' ambulance driver. Whenever the team has needed a pick-me-up in the Western Conference finals, it has been Perkins dead-aiming a 3-point shot or Perkins backing in for an unobstructable hook. Sonic fans, without his permission, have begun the following battle cry: "Sam, I Am."

Turns out it's not the caffeine.

"There're a lot of coffee places downtown, and I haven't been yet," said Perkins, who has called a Seattle hotel home. "But I will." Take the Short Shot

With this playoff series against the Suns moving south to Phoenix for Game 5 Tuesday night, tied two games apiece, Perkins is likely to become the focal point of a new, but rather elementary, Sonic strategy: Take the shortest shot available.

Previously, Seattle was living and dying by the 24-footer -- Perkins, in fact, buried one to win Game 2 -- but the Sonics have discovered what his former team, the Lakers, understood clearly. The 6-foot-9-inch Perkins will post up if you tell him to.
