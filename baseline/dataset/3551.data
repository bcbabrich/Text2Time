Mr. Skyler's comments came after the city had already announced a $2 million plan to upgrade the Parade Grounds, saying the money would be used to build a football field, to refurbish some soccer grounds and to rebuild two baseball diamonds. The notoriously bad drainage and watering systems at the 40-acre site were also to be redesigned.

But if the Mets plan goes through as initially described, it appears that at least two fields will be lost to general use and a third will be taken over for parking, at least temporarily.

Angered by what he sees as the administration's recalcitrance in disclosing its plan, the Brooklyn borough president, Howard Golden, has scheduled a public meeting of the borough's board for today. Mr. Golden's office said the special session at 6 p.m. in Borough Hall was called to force the administration to meet with the community, adding that officials with the Economic Development Corporation and the Parks Department had been invited to speak.

The city officials are likely to be met by a barrage of questions, from why the administration chose a short-season Mets farm team for the site to how other uses for the fields will be curtailed, particularly the youth soccer games now held at the Parade Grounds.

For the last several months, Mr. Golden has accused the Giuliani administration of not acting in the best interests of Brooklyn on the deal. He has said that the administration's refusal to consider other minor league ball clubs is short-sighted, and that a higher-level team -- playing a full season instead of the shorter Single A summer schedule -- will bring more money to the borough and more fans to the games.

In the meantime, parents whose children now play soccer, lacrosse or other field games on the Parade Grounds fear that they will be squeezed out. And those living around the Parade Grounds worry that problems with securing a stadium site in Coney Island will leave the farm team playing in their neighborhood permanently -- bringing with it traffic, unruly fans and parking problems.

Mostly, those opposing the plan say they just want some input before the city's Franchise and Concession Review Committee votes on the plan in two weeks.

''This is a big thing for everyone involved in the Parade Grounds and we really deserved to hear the facts about what's being proposed,'' said Howard Helene, whose 9-year-old son has grown up playing on the fields. ''Maybe this is a good thing for the park but because of the way it's been handled, nobody really knows.''
