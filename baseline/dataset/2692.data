For the beginning of his third term, Gov. George Pataki plans a low-key inauguration today in Albany. That is understandable, given the state's current condition. New York faces a deficit of $2 billion in its current budget with another $10 billion next year. After two terms in office, he still has far more unfulfilled promises than accomplishments. And despite his drumbeat about how, after Sept. 11, 2001, we all have to weather these difficult times together, the truth is that the state of New York State is Mr. Pataki's mess, and he has now been granted one more term to clean it up.

Obviously New York is not the only state suffering financially at this point. Across the nation, legislators and governors who slashed taxes and raised spending in good times are wringing their hands, trying to figure out where to cut or who to tax in order to deal with growing deficits and worsening economic news. But the most responsible states began tackling the problem far earlier than Governor Pataki. Running for office last year on a feel-good budget, he used surpluses and drained one-time bonuses to camouflage the widening holes. The governor acknowledged that the state was facing a $2 billion deficit exactly one month to the day after his re-election. Then he began hinting at taxes, layoffs and cuts, all of which should have been on the table far earlier. Worse, he began pushing to use money from the tobacco industry settlement to boost the state's borrowing power, a quick fix that only adds to long-term problems.

Mr. Pataki's legacy is on the line. All his bragging rights on environmental issues will slip away if New York State's financial health deteriorates under his care and he fails to rise to the other challenges facing him today. The same holds true for the other parts of his long-pending agenda. All his vaunted health care improvements will be forgotten if the level of education suffers and the rebuilding of downtown Manhattan descends into a bureaucratic muddle. His plans for campaign finance reform and humanizing the Rockefeller drug laws and reforming the judiciary will fade into lost rhetoric unless these bills become good and workable laws.

Mr. Pataki's inaugural ceremony is rightfully muted this year. He has many promises to keep before he can start to celebrate.
