Others include Robert Goulet, Ruth Carter Stapleton and James Irwin, the astronaut. The common element among them is conversion, usually in dramatic fashion, to a “personal relationship to Jesus Christ” in the mature years.

FOr Mr. Ash, the experience of deepened commitment took place, he says, 10 years ago. Like many others in the ranks of the evangelical surge, he had dropped out of church for many years and was leading a life that was successful by accepted social standards. But he says he felt an “emptiness” that led him on a spiritual quest.

He and his family came upon St. Paul's here in 1974: “My life has changed in such a basic way,” he said. “I was always the life of the party and thought I'd give up a lot by becoming a Christian. But I didn't. I'm a more positive thinker than ever.”

Basis of Phenomenon

The theory that people go through a series of crucial stock‐taking periods in their,middle years is used by some observers as one basis for explaining the spiritual phenomenon.

The Rev. Eugene Fullam, rector of St. Paul's, says many of the large segment of people in the 35-to-55-year-old group in his parish had run into “difficulty with the narrow views of the world that they had picked up in their youth, such as the idea that science held all the answers.” Many of them, he says, “found that their philosophies left them unsupported in their later lives.”

Father Fullam, a robust man whose preaching has proved uncommonly persuasive in this comfortable, upper-middle‐class community, says that many people recommit themselves in the middle years and thereby move toward ‘a more mature f,aith.”

An alternative’ interpretation is that many new evangelicals and charismatics are actually going back to their spiritual roots. For example, Dr. Donald Carroll, coordinator of church research at the Hartford Seminary Foundation, surveyed Baptist churches in Atlanta recently and found that for many newcomers to the city, especially those from small towns, the church was a stabilizing factor.
