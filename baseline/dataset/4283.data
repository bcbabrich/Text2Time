Nationalist Serbian forces stepped up activity on several fronts today, apparently using heavy weapons moved from Sarajevo to mount a fierce attack on the besieged city of Maglaj and to resume shelling Tuzla and its airport.

Although the United Nations-brokered cease-fire in Sarajevo has been generally holding, there were indications that it was beginning to fray. The United Nations spokesman here, Lieut. Col. Bill Aikman, said this morning that there had been reports of machine-gun and small-arms fire in several areas and a number of sniping incidents, in which at least one person had been killed in the city and four had been wounded.

The United Nations command said Serbian forces drove six tanks out of the "exclusion zone" imposed around the city on Feb. 21. United Nations officials said the tanks had been hidden in the zone in clear violation of the week-old ultimatum from NATO.

The situation at Maglaj was so desperate that the Bosnian President, Alija Izetbegovic, called a news conference tonight to warn that "there is great risk the city will fall." On Verge of Starvation
