Three American infantrymen patrolling Macedonia's border with the Yugoslav province of Kosovo were missing today after reporting by radio that they had been surrounded and were under fire, the Pentagon said.

The soldiers might have been captured, presumably by Serbian forces or paramilitary units, officials said, but they cautioned that they had no direct evidence of that.

[At 1:50 A.M. New York time Thursday, CNN broadcast videotape from Serbian television showing what the Serbs identified as the three Americans who were reported missing on Wednesday.

[Their names were not immediately available.]

The soldiers are part of the United States First Infantry Division, which has had about 350 members in Macedonia for years, a remnant of a United Nations force that is being withdrawn now that thousands of NATO troops are stationed near the border.
