BUFFALO, Jan. 2 (AP)— Seven patrol cars cruised throughout Erie County to day looking for motor vehicles that were polluting the air. Inspectors reported spotting 41 of them.

The county, acting under a new law, decided to put the patrol cars on the road for one day seeking pollution violators. Only one car will look for violators after to day.

Trucks were the worst vio lators, said Charles W. Kel latz, public health educator for the County Health De partment's air‐pollution con trol division.

He said the inspectors found 26 trucks—both diesel and gasoline‐engine powered —spewing smoke.

Only 13 automobiles and two buses were found emit ting smoke. Several of the cars were high‐priced, late models.
