JOE ELY delivered twanging, stomping, full-tilt rock-and-roll at the Ritz, 119 East 11th Street, on Friday night. For a decade, Mr. Ely has been singing and writing songs that match basic rock to lyrics that delight in wordplay and imagery. In the 1970's, he put together a band that reflected his Lubbock, Tex., background, mixing Mexican accordion, soul saxophone and country steel guitar with guitar-driven rockabilly; on his 1984 album ''Hi-Res,'' he also flirted with computers and synthesizers. Now, with his recent album, ''Lord of the Highway,'' and in concert, he's decided to trade eclecticism for punch.

His current, four-man band sounds closer to the Rolling Stones than to Lubbock's other gift to rock, Buddy Holly. But on its own terms, the music can challenge Jason and the Scorchers, the Georgia Satellites and just about any other heartland rock band.

Mr. Ely has become an assured rock frontman, shouting out songs with just a little country quaver at the edge of his voice. As before, he sings about romance, hard travel and breaking loose, and he hasn't simplified what he sings to fit the rock format; he still prefers lyrics with wry, unheroic twists. ''Lord of the Highway,'' written by his longtime associate Butch Hancock, may be the only driving song to mention bugs on the windshield; his own ''Me and Billy the Kid,'' which he sang at the Ritz as a fast-strummed, folky solo, is a far cry from most self-glorifying outlaw songs. And the humor in songs like ''My Baby Thinks She's French'' and ''Driving to the Poorhouse in a Limousine'' thrives with a supercharged band behind it.

Mr. Ely's set included a guest appearance by Will Sexton, a 17-year-old singer and guitarist whose forthcoming debut album was produced by Mr. Ely. Mr. Sexton is a tall, hearty Texas blues-rocker who has adapted to 1980's pop image-making; he stepped on stage wearing a black cowboy hat, a skin-tight black leather outfit, a single earring and impeccable, pale face makeup. Fashion aside, he belted his three featured songs with honky-tonk gusto, and when Mr. Ely returned Mr. Sexton shared some barnstorming lead-guitar duels with David Grissom of the Joe Ely Band.
