In real life, the names become household words: Laci Peterson, Chandra Levy, Elizabeth Smart. Television viewers see the photographs and the home movies of birthdays and vacations again and again. And when there's an occasional happy ending, like Ms. Smart's safe return to her home last March, people who have never even met the victim can feel strong emotion.

Television has recently taken note of the emotional identification that the public often feels about missing persons cases. Last fall CBS introduced ''Without a Trace,'' about a team of F.B.I. agents who investigate such disappearances. Now comes Lifetime's ''1-800-MISSING,'' which is not, as you might expect, a cheap copy of the CBS show. Actually this promising but wobbly new series, which has its premiere tomorrow night, seems to want to be the all-female ''X-Files.''

Gloria Reuben, known to television viewers as the soft-spoken physician assistant Jeanie Boulet on NBC's medical series ''E.R.,'' is the new show's name star. In ''1-800-MISSING,'' she's the dramatic equivalent of the straight man, playing Brooke Haslett, an experienced F.B.I. agent with the matter-of-factness and unflappability of Gillian Anderson's Dana Scully. ''Feelings make mistakes,'' she observes at one point. ''DNA doesn't.''

The premise's distinctiveness comes from Jess Mastriani (Caterina Scorsone), a recent college graduate who still lives with her mother. In the first scene of the premiere episode, Jess is struck by lightning and, as a result, begins to have dreams that indicate the whereabouts of people who have disappeared. She's promptly hired as an F.B.I. consultant, Brooke's new partner on missing persons cases.
