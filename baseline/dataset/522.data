Yet in recent years, in the never-ending search for an edge, teams have opened their eyes to sleep as a priority, backed up by science that increasingly points to its importance for physical and mental health. A solid night in the sack particularly helps players recover from the inevitable wear and tear of a taxing season.

Several other teams besides the Seahawks have also been focusing on sleep. And it has caught on in other sports — some N.B.A. players, for instance, take naps during the day to remain fresh for night games. Basketball and hockey teams adjust their flight schedules to allow their players more time to sleep. And New England quarterback Tom Brady made waves two years ago when he said he goes to sleep at 8:30 p.m.

Few teams, however, have cozied up to the idea as much as the Seahawks

It is partly out of necessity. The Seahawks are hours by plane from their nearest rivals and regularly log more miles than any other N.F.L. team. On Friday, for example, they flew five hours to New Jersey for their game against the Jets.

The focus on sleep also flows from the team’s holistic approach to player health, which encompasses, among other things, blood tests, meditation, and yoga. The team, 2-1, has been among the best in the N.F.L. in recent years, including a Super Bowl win in 2014.
