That many Americans dislike us comes as no surprise to most gay people. It is, of course, their privilege. But those who base their antipathy on the notion of volition need to be clear about this: we do not choose whom we are attracted to. What we do choose is our response to that attraction. Celibacy, sublimation, invisibility, hypocrisy and self-hatred are no longer acceptable choices for the majority of us. Yet by and large, they remain the only ones society willingly offers us.
