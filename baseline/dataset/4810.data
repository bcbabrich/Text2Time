Liberia's two largest political factions moved today to set aside their differences and put an end to a bitter rivalry that has cost tens of thousands of lives.

An accord between the National Patriotic Front and rival Interim Government of Liberia, a breakthrough after months of stalemate, was reached after a 90-minute meeting here between Charles Taylor, the leader of the front, and Amos Sawyer, the interim President. Five West African heads of government also attended the meeting.

Although details of the agreement were not disclosed, both Mr. Taylor and Mr. Sawyer described the meeting at the country estate of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny as historic.

But officials close to the talks cautioned that several major obstacles remain in the negotiations. There was virtually no discussion today of a date for free elections. The two sides also disagree on whether their troops should be integrated into a single army before or after elections are held. 'We Will Work Together'
