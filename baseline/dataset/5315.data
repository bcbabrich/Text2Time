The Environment Yesterday in Michigan, George Bush started to talk about something serious. Diversions about the Pledge of Allegiance or Mr. Dukakis's alleged lack of patriotism were laid aside. Mr. Bush addressed the mounting evidence of deterioration in the environment and promised to convene a global conference to discuss remedies. That's a welcome beginning to debate on a strangely neglected issue.

This has been a miserable summer. People gag on ozone smog as bad as in any year on record. They can't escape the heat by visiting the seashore because the beaches are polluted. They hear warnings that even hotter years lie ahead because of the global warming caused by the predicted greenhouse effect. All the stranger that until now, neither candidate has made concern about the state of the environment a major issue.

At his acceptance speech in Atlanta, Mr. Dukakis devoted a single sentence to the environment, saying he would rather protect it than polluters. Mr. Bush, in New Orleans, promised to stop ocean dumping, ''reduce the harm'' done by acid rain and have the F.B.I. nab discarders of medical waste.

Unfortunately the new environmental problems are more serious and more complex than the old ones. The threat to the life-protecting ozone layer in the stratosphere requires international agreement to stop manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons. There's already a pact to cap production of the chemicals, but further vigorous efforts by the U.S. are needed to prepare countries for the next step -phasing the chemicals out altogether.
