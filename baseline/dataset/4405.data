A double bill of Ned Rorem's opera "Miss Julie" and Emmanuel Chabrier's one-act operetta "Une Education Manquee" ("An Incomplete Education") is to be given three performances by the Manhattan School of Music Opera Theater, on Wednesday and on Dec. 9 at 8 P.M. and on Dec. 11 at 2:30 P.M. Mr. Rorem is to discuss "Miss Julie" in a free talk at 6:30 P.M. on Dec. 7, before the performance.

The Rorem work, based on the Strindberg play about a sexual duel between a young noblewoman and her butler, had its premiere in 1965 and has been revised and consolidated from two acts to one. The Chabrier piece, from 1879, is the tale of an innocent young couple in the Louis XVI period who arrive at their wedding night with no instruction but learn from love and instinct.

The performances, which have been staged by James Robinson, are to be conducted by David Gilbert. Tickets are $10 and $15. The school is at Broadway and 122d Street in Morningside Heights. Information: (212) 749-2802, extension 428.
