On any play in a Giants practice, receiver Amani Toomer runs his routes as if they were measured by a precise survey. Every cut has to be perfect, not a step wasted anywhere. He expects to catch every pass, no matter how poorly thrown. When he misses one, for whatever reason, he claps his gloved hands sharply, and occasionally follows with a stream of angry words.

''Amani's such a perfectionist,'' Giants cornerback Ralph Brown said. ''If he doesn't do something right or he drops a ball or he's covered by a defensive back, he feels like it's him, like he did something wrong. He gets mad and he gets it right on the next play.''

In games, Toomer maintains a cool, seen-it-all facade. When he dropped two touchdown passes in the 29-17 victory over the Minnesota Vikings last Sunday, he showed no emotion. But his teammates knew better. ''You know it was killing him,'' Brown said.

Toomer's precision is exactly what made the drops against Minnesota so stunning. He has long been the Giants' most dangerous receiver, their primary deep threat. He figured prominently in the offensive outburst last season and started this season the same way. He has caught most of the Giants' long passes, including a 77-yarder, a 54-yard touchdown and a 51-yard flea-flicker against Minnesota.
