Some restaurants stand at unusual culinary crossroads. Metropol stands at an unusual cartographical one.

It faces the intersection of two numbered streets that sound to the uninitiated as if they should be parallel to each other and about a quarter mile apart. But West Fourth and West 10th do indeed meet, an asterisklike exception to Manhattan's usually tidy grid, an anomaly that happens to be Metropol's address.

The restaurant itself represents a more typical convergence.

It's part bistro, part brasserie, those terms and genres being so thoroughly confused and conflated in New York these days. Globe-shaped lighting fixtures dangle from a pressed tin ceiling. A distressed mirror dominates one broad wall.

To those vintage flourishes Metropol weds the semiotics of a certain kind and era of downtown Manhattan cool. There are enormous black-and-white photographs of Edie Sedgwick, Andy Warhol, Nico. There's a thick cover of darkness.
