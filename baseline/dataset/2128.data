A heroic dog and cat were serenaded by a singing dog during the ASPCA awards banquet today, where they were honored for saving their owners’ lives.

The dog, a 2-year-old golden retriever named Toby, performed a modified Heimlich maneuver on his owner, Debbie Parkhurst of North East, Md., when she choked on a piece of apple. Toby pushed her to the floor and jumped up and down on Ms. Parkhurst’s chest until he dislodged the piece of apple.

The cat, a 14-year-old domestic shorthair named Winnie, saved the Keesling family of New Castle, Ind., in March from carbon monoxide poisoning by jumping on a bed and meowing wildly as poisonous carbon monoxide fumes filled the family’s home from a faulty gasoline-powered water pump in the the basement.



Winnie woke up Cathy Keesling by nuzzling her ear and caterwauling. When Ms. Keesling got out of bed, she was nauseated and unable to wake her husband. She called 911, and paramedics found the couple’s 14-year-old son unconscious on the floor near his bedroom.

At the banquet, held at the Rainbow Room at Rockefeller Center, Winnie and Toby did not get their own seats, nor apparently, their own plates of food (though Winnie sneaked shrimp out of the salad course).

Entertainment was provided by Oliver, the dog owned by Chuck Scarborough, the WNBC news anchorman, who was the M.C. of the awards program.

Oliver sang along to music from a harmonica, played by Mr. Scarborough’s nephew.

The honorees traveled fairly substantial distances to receive their honors. Winnie flew into La Guardia Airport, and Toby drove up from Maryland. City Room will observe they were both smart to avoid Kennedy Airport, which has not been a kind environment for dogs or cats of late.
