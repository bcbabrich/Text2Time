The Boys' Club of New York, with a record budget of $4 million and 5,400 members, started a new summer camp school for fifth- and sixth-graders this year and has helped get 150 boys into top preparatory schools and colleges this fall.

The club, which aims to provide a positive alternative to growing up on the streets, will soon open a large clubhouse on the Lower East Side. The club is open to any boy between the ages of 6 and 21 for fees ranging from 50 cents to $2 a year.

One member, Marc Wright, who is 17 years old, lives with an aunt in Spanish Harlem who is on welfare. With help from the Boys' Club, he won scholarships to two select schools in Massachusetts: the Fay School and the Brooks School.

Marc is determined, he said, to attend an Ivy League university.

Wants to Be a Lawyer

''We were all poor in the old neighborhood and wanted to succeed, but our goals weren't the same,'' he said recently. ''For many of my friends, success is a city job for $20,000 to $30,000 a year, but I'm going to be a lawyer and live in a neighborhood where I don't have to worry about people getting killed or jumping off bridges.''
