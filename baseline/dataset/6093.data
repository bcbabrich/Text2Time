WASHINGTON, Sept. 1 (UPI)—The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced today it is to undertake a year‐long study of state and Federal regulation of the nation's 14,700 commercial banks.

The reason for the study, which the agency described as “major,” is to reduce regulatory costs and “needless red tape.”

“The study will describe in detail the relationship between state and Federal bank supervision and regulation in order to pinpoint precisely the nature and extent of duplication and conflict that actually exists,” the F.D.I.C. said.

The nation's banks are regulated on the Federal level by the F.D.I.C., the Federal Reserve Board and the Comptroller of the Currency. State governments, in most cases, also have bank supervisory facilities. The study will be directed by Leonard Lapidus, who until July was acting superintendent of banks in New York State.
