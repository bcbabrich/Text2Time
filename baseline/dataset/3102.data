The number of international terrorist attacks increased by 8 percent last year, largely because of a surge in bombings by two rebel groups in Colombia and attacks by paramilitary groups operating there, the State Department said today.

South Asia remains the focal point for terrorism directed against the United States, the department's annual report on global terrorism said, with the Taliban in Afghanistan continuing to provide safe haven for international terrorists and Pakistan backing terrorist groups as well.

Despite the concerns about Pakistan and Afghanistan, contained in the report for the second year in a row, they were not added to the list of nations accused of state-sponsored terrorism. Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria have long held that designation, which brings with it strict sanctions.

The report is based on data collected in the final year of the Clinton administration, but officials said the Bush administration had ample time to review and change the report, and therefore it represents the first view of global terrorism under the new administration.
