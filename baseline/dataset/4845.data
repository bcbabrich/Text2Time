Whatever Pina Bausch hath wrought, it hath not been a major influence in the United States, where experimental dance has been virtually unaffected by her brand of dance theater. But Miss Bausch's penchant for subordinating conventional dance movement to dramatic imagery, often confessional, is still shared by many European and French Canadian choreographers.

Or so things seem at the current International Festival of New Dance in Montreal. In one performance a bare-breasted housewife had a sexual fling with a wolf peeking out of a console and a live falcon in another troupe presided over the surreal and sunless horror of a Central European hovel.

Miss Bausch's influence is indirect and often diluted, and unless practiced at the highest level, dance theater can be more of an excuse than a genre. Guaranteeing a consistently high level in this respect will be difficult for this enterprising festival, which continues through Oct. 6. Thursday's offerings proved mixed, if always original.

Josef Nadj, whose Theatre Jel has yet to be seen in the United States, is one of the most talked about newer choreographers in France. An ethnic Hungarian from Yugoslavia, he arrived in Paris in 1980 at the age of 20 and became part of France's experimental dance boom.
