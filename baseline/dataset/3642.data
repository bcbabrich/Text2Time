To the Editor:

If Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani really cared about the heritage of the Yankees and about keeping them in New York (news article, April 29), he could prevent their leaving by one simple measure. He could publicly ask Major League Baseball to order that only a team playing in New York City could be named the Yankees, as the National Football League has required for the Cleveland Browns. Let George Steinbrenner have his Elizabeth Engineers if he wants, but the Yankees belong to New York City.
