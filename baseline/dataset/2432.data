To the Editor:

Re "A Better Tower" (editorial, June 30):

While I still think ground zero should be kept strictly as a memorial out of respect for those who lost their lives in the Sept. 11 attacks, I have to admit that the latest plans for the new Freedom Tower are looking more promising.

The newly proposed Freedom Tower looks better. Its form is simpler, and it's easier on the eyes. The first proposed drawing of the Freedom Tower looked a little too tacky for an office building. More important, though, is the fact that the building was redesigned to be safer from any future terrorist attack.

Whatever the actual final design for the former World Trade Center turns out to be, it seems only fair that it should have to be voted on and approved by the families of the 9/11 victims before it is actually built.
