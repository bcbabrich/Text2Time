Ralph Perez stood in his green inmate's uniform on a stage in the Correctional Institution for Men on Rikers Island last week and stroked the varnished wood of a bass.

“The bass I use here needs strings and the bridge is cracked,” he said sadly.

Mr. Perez, a 44-year-old jazz musician known professionally as Frank Tizol, was once a member of the New Jazz Octet and other jazz groups. Now he is serving a one‐year sentence on a weapons‐possession charge.

When a group of 19 jazz musicians known as the Jazzmobile CETA Band went to Rikers Island yesterday, to entertain the inmates, prison officials let Mr. Perez roam freely backstage, in deference to his reputation among the visiting artists.

“You got a nice touch,” said Vic Colucci, the 25-year-old bass player in the band, as Mr. Perez slid his thick fingers up and down the strings of the bass before the start of the concert.
