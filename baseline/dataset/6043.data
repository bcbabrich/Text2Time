ST. LOUIS, May 1—St. Louis welcomed on Friday a long overdue prodigal son, Al Hirschfeld, theater caricaturist extraordinary, who last visited his native heath just over half a century ago.

That was for an art show, his first American exhibition, and the occasion for the new visit was also an art show. The one in 1925 presented a relatively unknown sketcher and water colorist in a now defunct downtown gallery, while Friday's show drew prices of up to $4,500 for original gouaches, lithographs and etchings, mostly of show business personalities, by a now worldrenowned artist.

There was plenty of raw material for the caricaturist as 200 local beautiful and not so beautiful people in formal evening attire nibbled at quiche and sipped champagne and mugged shamelessly for the roving professional photographers. The guest of honor, looking like a patient St. Nicholas in his now‐white shovel beard and hair, obligingly acceded to all requests to pose for pictures with individuals and groups and autographed purchased items and programs.

About $35,000 of Hirschfeld art, from early Neo‐Impressionist etchings to oversized Japanese tapestries of recent years, was sold at the evening reception, which opened a month‐long exhibition at the Harmon Gallery in nearby Clayton.
