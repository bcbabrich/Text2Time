SAIGON, South Vietnam, Thursday, Feb. 1—Fighting continued to sputter and flare in South Vietnam yesterday as the cease‐fire went into its fifth day.

A South Vietnamese military spokesman said yesterday that there was a slight decrease in the level of military activity during the last 24 hours, but he dismissed the reduction as “not significant.”

Earlier, American analysts had said that they expected the level of fighting to subside to something approaching a real cease‐fire by last night.

The South Vietnamese do not report any violations of the cease‐fire by their own troops, and there were no available (reports from the Communists yesterday. In the past the Vietcong command has said that its troops were “scrupulously” adhering to the terms of the cease‐fire and that the Saigon Government's forces were repeatedly violating them.
