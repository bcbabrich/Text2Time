Benjamin DeMott, a prominent writer, scholar and cultural critic whose work explored the mythology that underpins contemporary American life, especially collective ideas about race, class and sex, died on Thursday at his home in Worthington, Mass. He was 81 and also had a home in Anna Maria, Fla.

The cause was cardiac arrest, his son Tom said.

At his death, Mr. DeMott was emeritus professor of English at Amherst College, where he had taught for nearly 40 years. Before retiring from the college in 1990, he was the Mellon professor of humanities there.

The author of more than a dozen books, Mr. DeMott was best known for a trilogy that examined cultural beliefs in three sensitive areas: "The Imperial Middle: Why Americans Can't Think Straight About Class" (William Morrow & Company, 1990); "The Trouble With Friendship: Why Americans Can't Think Straight About Race" (Atlantic Monthly Press, 1995); and "Killer Woman Blues: Why Americans Can't Think Straight About Gender and Power" (Houghton Mifflin, 2000).

The books investigated what Mr. DeMott saw as three pervasive social myths: the assumption, held by many Americans, that we live in a classless society; the promise, held out by movies and television, that individual friendships between blacks and whites can vanquish racism all by themselves; and the images of women, ubiquitous in popular culture, that render them almost indistinguishable from men.
