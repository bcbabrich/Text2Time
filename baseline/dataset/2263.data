Senator Joseph Lieberman has sold his house in New Haven and is preparing to downsize, at the behest of his wife, Hadassah.

The Liebermans are about to become empty nesters, as the youngest of their four children is about to go off the college this fall. They are planning to move to somewhere in downtown New Haven, a campaign official said.

Although they have a buyer for their current home, they are waiting until after the Aug. 8 Democratic primary to find someplace new and to close the deal.

While this comes as Mr. Lieberman is trying to fend off an anti-war challenge in the primary, no greater meaning should be read into the move, a campaign official said.
