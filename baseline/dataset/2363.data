The Finnish conductor Osmo Vanska has been causing a stir in recent seasons, and that's good news in an orchestral world starved for directors with something fresh and exciting to say.

Last season, Mr. Vanska took over the Minnesota Orchestra, his first American ensemble, but he has also retained the directorship of a group in Finland, the Lahti Symphony Orchestra, which he has directed since 1988. He has just led the Lahti players on a brief tour that began in Minneapolis on Jan. 25 and ended at Avery Fisher Hall on Sunday afternoon.

Mr. Vanska is a graceful conductor whose gestures seem to communicate his ideas directly and energetically. That was certainly the case in the Sibelius works that framed his program. His account of the folkloric tone poem "Pohjola's Daughter" was a study in dark, gradually shifting hues. The work describes the warrior Vainamoinen undertaking several tasks to win the hand of the Maid of Pohjola, but giving up after injuring himself with an ax. The performance not only rendered the work's narrative underpinning vividly but also showed off the nimbleness of the orchestra's strings and woodwinds, and the robustness of its brass.

Those qualities were magnified in Mr. Vanska's unusual performance of Sibelius's Second Symphony. This was a strikingly less sentimental reading than British, American and Russian conductors typically give. In the introduction, for example, Mr. Vanska moved steadily toward the first theme, avoiding the tempo fluctuations that are, not without reason, a strong temptation. Instead, his focus at that point was on coloration and dynamics, although later in the score, most notably in the slow movement and in the sweeping, lyrical finale, he added rhythmic flexibility to his expressive arsenal.
