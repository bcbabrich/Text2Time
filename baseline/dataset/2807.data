The set presents the concertos chronologically, beginning with No. 2 in B flat (composed first but published second). In the opening exposition Mr. Harnoncourt's penchant for breaking up phrases into clear segments is in full operation. After the orchestra plays the hardy opening statement of the theme, there is an extra breath before the strings answer with the soft, lyrical second phrases. The problem is that that slight pause sounds calculated, as if making a point was as important as shaping the phrase.

Mr. Harnoncourt is not afraid to encourage a sense of rough and tumble in the playing when called for. At a turning point in the music, before the piano enters, the full orchestra emits three playfully grim fortissimo blasts of unison C naturals, followed, after a pause, by three echoes in the strings and flutes a half-step higher. But Mr. Harnoncourt overdoes the contrast. As played, the passage reminded me of a point that Virgil Thomson once made in reviewing a hyped-up performance of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Why, he wondered, do musicians assume contrast always involves conflict?

When the piano enters Mr. Aimard brings a similar quality of periodicity to his phrasing, but in a more natural way. You are swept along by the energy in his playing, even in soft moments, and by the punchy clarity in his passagework, qualities that surely stem from his long experience with modern music.

Still, despite my misgivings about Mr. Harnoncourt, with each listening to these performances (and I've found it hard to stop listening) his conducting has seemed more satisfying. Maybe you just get used to his liberties. Eventually the quality of musical surprise he strives for, the sense that you don't know what will happen next, comes through.

During the first movement of the B-flat concerto, when the music takes a curiously reflective turn, Mr. Aimard slows down radically while Mr. Harnoncourt holds the orchestra taut and quietly tense. Suddenly you glimpse in this work steeped in Viennese Classicism the mysticism to come in the Concerto No. 4 in G, which transcends any era.

The performance of the G major Concerto has a searching intensity. In the slow movement Mr. Harnoncourt treats the stern, unison statements in the strings like grim pronouncement from a Baroque oratorio, and Mr. Aimard plays the pleading, hushed chordal responses as if the piano were some wayward soul timorously asking, ''Will someone listen to me?'' The final movement, performed with wondrous rhythmic bite by Mr. Aimard and driving energy by all, achieves a dynamic ambiguity: is the music jaunty or hellbent?
