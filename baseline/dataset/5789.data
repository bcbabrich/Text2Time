A sharp rise in the price of the General Foods Corporation's stock helped the Dow Jones industrial average record a sizable gain yesterday, but the market over all was little changed on only moderately heavy volume.

The trading activity was less impressive considering that the New York Stock Exchange had an extra half-hour to trade: its 9:30 opening was inaugurated yesterday.

The uninspired session followed the cancellation of exchange trading Friday because of Hurricane Gloria. Certain hot stocks, however, traded off the markets that day. That created an unusual situation yesterday in calculating market indicators such as the Dow, which gained 7.84 points yesterday, to close at 1,328.63.

General Foods, one of the 30 issues that make up the Dow, was one of the stocks that traded heavily off the Big Board on Friday, when its agreement to be acquired by the Philip Morris Companies for $120 a share was announced.
