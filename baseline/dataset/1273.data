Note: The Sunday puzzle post directly precedes this one.

Yes, I know we had a big goodbye just a week ago, with Jim Horne heading off into the sunset. But that went so well, here’s part 2.

It’s been a pleasure and an honor to be a part of Wordplay for the past 14 months, and a big part of that was thanks to you. You make this a very pleasant place to visit — intelligent, funny and civilized. Half of my job was trying to find ways of adding to that; the other half, to stay out of the way.

The comments here are a daily stew of thoughts, reactions, praise, grumblings, asides, questions, answers, revelations and laughs. And those represent just the tip of the iceberg; for every comment that’s posted, there are many more readers thinking the same thing. Another thanks to all the loyal lurkers who stop by here every day, from every part of the world (including the 12 of you in Ljubljana).

I can’t think of a classier or brighter guy than Jim Horne. His insights and analyses were always smart, remarkably varied, funny and even poetic at times. It was a privilege to be sharing this job with him.

Aimée and Justin, the two Times editors who looked over every one of our posts, were a delight to work with. I still haven’t met them, but I hope to change that soon. I have met their boss Kathleen McElroy, a wonderful woman who oversees all the blogs at The Times, a feat in itself.

Robert Samuels, on the business and logistical end, has been terrific to work with. Other “friends of the puzzle” include the indispensable Ellen Ripstein, Cindy Day, Keith Dixon, Miki Meek and Cheryl Berman.

A huge thanks to Will Shortz, both for the terrific puzzles he brings us every day and for the time he graciously gave whenever I had a question for a post. And an equally huge thanks to all the constructors who lavish us daily with their clever offerings (and sometimes stop by here).

I’d also like to say how nice it was to share the same wedge of cyberspace with Pradeep Mutalik and Gary Antonick, who greatly increased the level of intelligence and creativity around here with their weekly Numberplay posts.

Although I’m stepping down from my role here, I’ll likely be roaming the Wordplay halls, and there might be an occasional Ashen & Noir cartoon in your future.

Maybe I’ll even write a puzzle or two.

P.S. My annual calendar is now out, featuring a guest appearance (more like a takeover) by Ashen and Noir. You can download a free PDF from my personal blog by clicking here.
