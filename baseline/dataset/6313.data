WASHINGTON, Dec. 2 —Diplomatic informants here said today that the $100‐million effort of the United Nations re lief agency in East Pakistan is “grinding to a halt” and that the agency has abandoned 162 new trucks, bought with international relief funds, at Chittagong because of fighting in the area.

The informants said the agency had removed the rotors from the trucks’ engines to prevent seizure of the vehicles either by the Pakistani Army or by local Bengali guerrillas. Pakistani authorities in the area, the informants said, were furious about this.

The agency, is, however, still using 100 other trucks in other areas in East Pakistan.

The United Nations agency has left one staff man at Chittangong to watch over the trucks, which cost $5,000 to $10,000 each, in the hope that the fighting will die down soon and distribution of food grains and other goods may be resumed.

Agency Staff Reduced

But in recent weeks, according to trustworthy sources, the agency has reduced its operating personnel in East Pakistan by approximately threefifths.
