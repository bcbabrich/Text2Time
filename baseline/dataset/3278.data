Although it bears the title ''Two Women,'' Tahmine Milani's film is really about one. And her name is legion.

While ''Two Women'' is set in Iran, the suffering woman at its compassionate heart may be found wherever those like her are denied a right to education and work, are oppressed and abused by husbands, are stalked by violent, obsessive men and are denied recourse in court.

''I am a human being!'' she cries in despair at one point. But almost no one seems to care.

Ms. Milani's impressive, unsettling, deeply felt film about a brilliant young woman trapped and reduced to hopelessness in a society that accords her no right to equality is said to have proved a sensation when released last year in Iran. ''Two Women'' may be seen at tonight and tomorrow in the 29th New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art.

The women of the title are Fereshteh and Roya, who meet as university students in Tehran and become fast friends in the tumultuous period of the Iranian revolution of the late 1970's, when factions dedicated to the clerical forces of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini clashed with westernized intellectuals and liberals on campuses.
