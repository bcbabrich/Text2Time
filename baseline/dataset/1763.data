It’s not often that fans of “Theater Talk” and “Monday Night Football” converge, but that just might happen at “Fantasy Football: The Musical?,” a show making its world premiere at the New York Musical Theater Festival.

The piece was written and composed by David Ingber, a 24-year-old Harvard grad and self-proclaimed “sports and theater nut.” Set in 1991, it tells the story of two friends — an unemployed sports statistics geek and a small-time bookie — who combine their love of stats and gambling to come up with what Mr. Ingber calls “the ultimate fan experience.”

The score, a pop-rock mix, is influenced by Mr. Ingber’s nostalgia for the music of the early 90s.

“If people miss Ace of Base and PM Dawn, come on down,” he said.

Following are excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Ingber a few days before the first performance.

Q.

When I read the title of this show I thought, uh-oh. Musical theater people and fantasy football people don’t mix.

A.

Anyone that I’ve told this title to — just the title alone — they either smile and say that’s the most hilarious idea ever or they say, Well, that will never work. I love either challenge. If we can get a few sports fans in that have never seen theater before just because they’re piqued by the title, awesome. If we can get some theater fans to appreciate sports for the first time, that’s awesome too.

I’m in rare company as a huge sports nut and a huge theater nut. Some of our cast members are in that category. There are some of us out there.

Q.

Are you concerned that neither group will show up? That theater people will stay away and sports people will too?

A.

We already know that they’re not going to stay away because we’ve sold out everything. NYMF keeps giving us more and more shows and we keep selling them out. We’re happy to say that we only have a handful of tickets left for our final extension performance, and that’s on a Thursday at 11 p.m., and that’s selling pretty well.

Q.

Why the question mark in the title?

A.

I thought people would read the poster and put a question mark on there anyway, that they might look at it and say, “Fantasy football, the musical? Really? Come on.” So we preempted that. It’s very tongue in cheek. I wanted to set that attitude in motion, that we know how kooky and goofy it is.

Q.

What’s the musical style of the show? What do the songs sound like?

A.

I try to mix up the genres. There’s one character who’s a singer-songwriter, so she’s got a toned-down ballad. There’s one character who’s an up-and-coming early 90s hip-hop star, so he brings that flava to the mix. A lot of it is pop-rock or power ballads. I think power ballads are the greatest thing in musical history.

Q.

Why do you think there aren’t there more sports-themed musicals?

A.

“Damn Yankees” is the one people think about as the super successful sports-themed musical, although of course that’s more of a Faust musical than it is a sports musical.

But if you look in the entertainment landscape a little bit wider, there are a lot of sports-related things. “Friday Night Lights” I think is one of the best shows on television. There’s that new show, “The League,” on FX at the end of the month, which is actually about a fantasy football league.

“Fantasy Football: The Musical?” opens tonight at 8 p.m., and runs at various times through Thursday, Oct. 8. More information is available at the show’s Web site or at NYMF.org.
