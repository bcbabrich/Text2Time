METRO DIGEST NEW YORK CITY 'WELL' OF DRUGS, STREET OF FEAR

The police call it "the Well" -- the block of Knickerbocker Avenue, between Troutman and Jefferson Streets in Bushwick, that has become the most notorious drug bazaar in Brooklyn and one of the toughest in New York City. To spend two weeks in the Well -- to talk with its residents, addicts, dealers, police officers and social-service workers -- is to see how the drug trade can invade and occupy the entire life of a neighborhood. A1. DOCTORS FOR THE POOR

In a move aimed at lowering costs and improving medical care, the Dinkins administration is taking its first steps toward providing poor residents with their own doctors. Beginning today, in a sweeping overhaul of health care provided to the poor, welfare recipients in southwest Brooklyn will be asked to choose their doctors from a list provided by the city. The goal is to give Medicaid recipients an alternative to emergency room care, which for many of the city's poor has been the mainstay of their medical care. A1.

A SHRINKING SKYSCRAPER

After watching their cityscape rise higher and higher over the centuries, New Yorkers are about to witness something remarkable: a shrinking skyscraper. High above the Upper East Side, a cocoon of metal mesh and netting is soon to envelop the top of an empty 31-story apartment tower at 108 East 96th Street. Within the cocoon, a robotic demolition device will begin pounding away at concrete slabs and columns. And by the time the cocoon has disappeared, the top 12 floors -- 12 too many for its neighborhood's zoning rules -- will be gone. B3. HOSPITAL BLAMED FOR PATIENT'S DEATH

St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center was responsible for the death of a noted radio-station executive admitted for minor foot surgery three months ago, a state investigation has concluded. The investigators said that in preparing the patient, Rick Sklar, for surgery, medical personnel inserted an anesthesia tube that sent oxygen to the stomach rather than the lungs. B3.
