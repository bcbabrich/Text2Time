''The differential is so small, and the number of women at selective colleges is more than the number of men, so I don't think it has had much of an effect,'' he said.

But Monty Neill, executive director of Fairtest, an advocacy group based in Cambridge, Mass., said the gap was ''clearly significant because college admissions are in part decided on these tests and a lot of special programs and scholarships are largely awarded based on test scores.''

''Our view is that the test itself is biased,'' she added.

White students also continued to do better than most underrepresented minorities. White students showed a one-point gain on the verbal test and no gains on the math test over last year's results. Scores for black students remained the same on the verbal test and fell four points in math.

Overall scores for Hispanic students were also lower, except for Puerto Rican students, whose scores were up three points in verbal and one point in math.

The Educational Testing Service, the company that administers the College Board tests, is in the early stages of developing a formula to help colleges adjust scores for members of minorities and other students who have fewer educational advantages, providing a kind of handicapping system.

Those efforts, College Board officials said yesterday, did not suggest that the current scores were less valid.

''Looking at SAT scores in a broader context is something admissions people have done for years,'' said Gretchen Rigol, vice president for special projects at the College Board. ''Though there are lots of people interested in this research, it is far from being operational.''
