The rapper DMX was sentenced on Friday to 90 days in jail and at least 18 months of supervised probation following his conviction on charges of theft, drug possession and animal cruelty, The Associated Press reported. Maricopa County Superior Court Commissioner Phemonia Miller also put DMX, whose real name is Earl Simmons, on supervised probation for at least 18 months. On Dec. 30, Mr. Simmons, 38, pleaded guilty to felony counts of theft, possession or use of marijuana, and possession or use of narcotic drugs, and to a misdemeanor count of animal cruelty. He has been in custody in the Maricopa County Jail since Dec. 9. The time he has already served will not count toward the 90 days, Ms. Miller said on Friday. The animal cruelty and drug charges resulted from a raid of Mr. Simmonsâ€™ home in August 2007 that was carried out as part of an investigation of a report of animal abuse. A dozen malnourished pit bulls, three dead dogs, guns and drugs were discovered in the raid.
