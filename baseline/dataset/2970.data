''What I've heard from neighbors, and not from police, was that one of the young men involved had a girlfriend who was seriously injured,'' Ms. Preckwinkle said, standing this afternoon near the crumbling stone steps where the truck came to rest.

''It sounds to me as if he just went berserk and attacked the drivers of the vehicle,'' she said. ''And the speculation is that he was assisted by some of his friends or others in the crowd.''

The police had one man in custody this afternoon in connection with the killings, the authorities said. They would not identify the man, but said that he was considered a suspect and that charges were pending.

The authorities said they were speaking with several others but had not yet identified anyone other than the man in custody as a suspect.

Witnesses have told the police that as many as six men may have taken part in the beatings.

At a news conference today, Supt. Terry Hillard of the Chicago Police Department asked the public for help in catching the killers.

''A thug is a thug is a thug is a thug,'' Mr. Hillard said. ''These are murderers. They killed two individuals. One of them was a senior citizen.''

The authorities identified the dead men as Jack Moore, 62, and Anthony Stuckey, 49. Both lived within a few blocks of where they were dragged from the rental truck.
