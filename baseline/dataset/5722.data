The United Cable Television Corporation said that it had started a tender offer to buy back about 16.5 percent of its stock for $40 a share, or a total of $80 million. The company said it wanted to buy a maximum of two million of its 12.1 million shares outstanding because it was an ''attractive investment.'' The shares will be purchased with the proceeds of a $100 million debt issue.
