Recognizing that thousands of homeless, mentally ill veterans were missing out on Federal benefits and services, city, state and Federal officials are planning a new effort to find and assist veterans with housing and psychiatric needs.

The program, to be announced today, will assist up to 300 veterans with mental illnesses in its first year, said a spokesman for New York State's Office of Mental Health. The state will spend $3.7 million in the first year of the program, and the Federal Department of Veterans Affairs will send workers into the streets and to city shelters to help identify eligible veterans.

Richard C. Surles, the state's Commissioner of Mental Health, said part of the impetus for the program was the realization by state mental health officials that the state was bearing most of the burden for helping homeless, mentally ill veterans.

The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that up to 250,000 of the nation's veterans are homeless, with 12,000 of them in New York City.
