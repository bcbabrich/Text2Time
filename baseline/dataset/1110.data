INDIANAPOLIS — If Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski can’t play in Super Bowl XLVI because of a high ankle sprain, there might not be anyone to fill his shoes.

It feels like tempting fate for the Patriots, who streamrolled the league with their dual threats — Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez — but they have no other tight ends on the active roster. Carson Butler has been stashed on the practice squad for 16 months.

The New England tight ends coach, Brian Ferentz, agrees that it is an odd situation.

“You are living a little dangerously at times when most of our offense is geared toward having two tight ends out there,” Ferentz said. “My argument is that the offense never changes, just the people who are in there.”

But the Patriots haven’t been satisfied with most of their other options, waiving tight ends Will Yeatman and Dan Gronkowski and offensive tackle Thomas Welch, who lined up as an eligible receiver at times. Those duties have been handed to the rookie offensive tackle Nate Solder, who started at tight end for two seasons with the University of Colorado.

“I’ve been flexible,” said Solder, who is primarily a blocker when he serves as the third tight end. “I’ve been playing all sorts of different positions, and I just go in wherever they need me.”

He may have to go in often Sunday, although Hernandez doesn’t seem too worried about Gronkowski, who has not practiced this week after leading the N.F.L. with 17 receiving touchdowns.

“Everybody needs to step up if Rob isn’t 100 percent, because he draws so much attention and is such a threat on the field,” Hernandez said. “I think he’ll play. I think he’ll be a big impact in this game.”

And on the other sideline? The Giants have kept three tight ends — Jake Ballard, Bear Pascoe and Travis Beckum — on their active roster all season despite relying on their wide receivers for the downfield passing game.
