To the Editor:

I appreciate your June 30 editorial ''Mr. Nader's Misguided Crusade,'' acknowledging the political power of Ralph Nader and the Green Party. But before you declare him a spoiler, consider that he has already won a partial election victory.

This week, when Al Gore proposed an energy plan with a light-green tint, he no doubt pulled a few votes from the Nader camp. If Mr. Gore can keep going and co-opt the Green Party positions on campaign reform, labor issues and world trade, he just might take enough votes from Mr. Nader to win the election. And I wouldn't be surprised if Mr. Nader declared such an outcome a victory, exonerating himself of charges of egotism.
