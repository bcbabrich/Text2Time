Nevertheless, he said, this re cent “short lag” between the marked reduction in the rate of monetary expansion and slower economic growth has made him “confident that an ef fective basis has been laid for an ultimate deceleration of price increases.”

Over the near future, the money supply should be in creased at a rate of 3 per cent, Mr. Francis contended. He de scribed this rate as moderate by historical standards and about in line with the rate from 1961 to 1964 when the economy was in a noninflation ary recovery.

Brake on Output

With a 3 per cent rate of increase, the economy would go through a “mild recession” this year with a decrease in output of approximately 1 per cent, the central banker pre dicted.

At the end of 1970, unem ployment would be about per cent, he said. The price level would be rising only a little more slowly than in re cent quarters, but the stage would be set for a “substan tial improvement” in the be havior of prices in 1971 and 1972.

If the money supply is not allowed to grow at all, Mr. Francis warned, there would be “a substantial recession, of at least the magnitude of the one we had in 1960–61.” Real out put would decline at about a 3 per cent annual rate and un employment would rise to about 6 per cent by the end of the year, he said.

By End of the Year

Under this circumstance, prices would be rising at an annual rate about one percen tage point less than the increase in the first three quarters of 1969, he calculated.

If, on the other hand, the money supply were to be in creased at a 6 per cent rate—a rate approaching the “exces sive” growth of 1967 and 1968 —the economy would have been brought to the border of a re cession without making any significant headway in the fight against inflation, the central banker reasoned.
