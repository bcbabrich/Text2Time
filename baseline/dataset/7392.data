LONDON, Dec. 31 (AP) —A hand‐painted decanter of sloe gin nearly 150 years old has been sent to Premier Khrushchev as a New Year's gift from England. Capt. Michael Farr, the Plymouth wine merchant who sent it, said: “I wanted to make sure that Mr. K. has a drop of genuine Olde Englishe instead of vodka or foreign wines for his New Year toast.”
