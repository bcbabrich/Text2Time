Though “Peter and the Starcatcher” is scheduled to close on Broadway on Jan. 20, the show, Rick Elice’s imaginative prequel to “Peter Pan,” has clearly not run out of magic. The show’s producers said on Tuesday that the production will be transferred this March to New World Stages, an Off Broadway complex where several other shows — including “Avenue Q” and “Million Dollar Quartet” — have had post-Broadway lives.

The New World Stages version will be mounted by the same team that staged the current run at the Brooks Atkinson Theater. Neither an opening date nor casting details have been announced.

The play, which is directed by Roger Rees and Alex Timbers, won five Tony awards and has already had several lives, starting with a Williamstown Theater Festival lab performance in 2007 that led to a full-length version, produced at the La Jolla Playhouse in 2009. When it opened at the New York Theater Workshop in March 2011, Ben Brantley described it in The New York Times as a “blissful exercise in make-believe,” and was equally enchanted by it a year later, when it moved to Broadway.

By the time it finishes its Broadway run, it will have played 18 previews and 320 performances at the Brooks Atkinson Theater.
