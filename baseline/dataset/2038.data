Just a short while ago, President Bush made good on his promise, and vetoed the war spending bill that included a timeline for troop withdrawal passed by the Democratic-controlled Congress last month. He made his action public in a short announcement, saying the Democrats had approved a plan that set a “rigid and artificial” deadline that “would impose impossible conditions for our commanders and troops in combat.”

“I recognize that many Democrats saw this bill as an opportunity to make a political statement about their opposition to the war,” he said. “They sent their message,” but now, he warned, Congress should begin working on a new bill so that troops can get necessary funds. A meeting with Congressional leaders from both parties is scheduled for tomorrow at the White House. Benchmarks for the Iraqi government appear to be a likely starting point for negotiations.

“The need to act is urgent,” he said.

Mr. Bush also defended his troop buildup, saying that sectarian murders in Iraq have decreased “substantially” since January. He added that the suicide attacks still occurring are “largely the work of Al Qaeda, the enemy that everyone agrees we should be fighting.”

Though Mr. Bush did not address the anniversary of his “mission accomplished” speech, war opponents have made much of the fact that the veto comes exactly four years after Mr. Bush announced that major combat operations in Iraq had ended with a banner that read “Mission Accomplished” behind him.

Referring to the banner, John Edwards, seeking the Democrats’ nomination, said at a town hall meeting in Seattle today, “All the photo ops in the world can’t hide the truth – his disastrous mismanagement of the war has left our troops in harm’s way and made Iraq a breeding ground for terrorists.”

“When the president vetoes the bill, it is George Bush who is not supporting our troops, and nobody else,” he added.

Americans United for Change, a liberal group, has been running an ad nationwide since Friday comparing Mr. Bush’s 2003 declaration with footage of violence since then. “He was wrong then, and he is wrong now,” an announcer says before urging Mr. Bush not to veto the bill.

Update: The Democrats’ leaders in Congress, Senator Harry Reid and Representative Nancy Pelosi, just held a brief press conference.

“In the coming days, we’ll continue to reach out to the president, and we hope congressional Republicans who remained silent—congressional Republicans through this whole debate—will work with us as well,” said Mr. Reid. “But if the president thinks that by vetoing this bill he’ll stop us from working to change the direction of the war in Iraq, he is mistaken.”
