Two Suffolk County surgeons and the hospital in which they practice have reportedly been indicted on charges stemming from the alleged use of a medical supply salesman to help perform a major bone surgery.

A source close to the New York State Assembly's investigation into illegal practices by physicians said that Dr. David Lipton and Dr. Howard Massoff—both of Smithtown—and the Smithtown General Hospital were named in the indictments. A lawyer for thè private hospital said Smithtown General had been charged with falsifying records, allegedly to conceal the participation of a salesman of prosthetic devices, William MacKay, in a 1975 operation to implant an artificial hip in a patient.

It is against the law to practice medicine without a license, and the indictment construes the hospital's failure to list Mr. MacKay as present in the operating room during the operation as a concealment of that crime.

Drs. Lipton and Massoff, who were performing the operation, reportedly encountered difficulties and had Mr. MacKay called in from a golf course to assist. !By his own account, Mr. MacKay replaced the artificial hip with a new one, completing the process for the surgeons. Mr. MacKay has been granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for his cooperation in the investigation of the case.
