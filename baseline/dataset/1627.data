Since the cherry blossoms happen for only a few days, when is the best time to go to Tokyo to see them?

It is impossible to say with any assurance exactly when the cherry blossoms will bloom in Japan, but a rather detailed guide to help plan such a trip is on About.com’s “Cherry Blossom Travel Planner” (disclosure: About.com is owned by The New York Times Company). The guide includes a map of average flowering dates; Tokyo’s is March 28 (though in 2008 the bloom began on March 22, and in 2007 it started on March 20). “Unexpected warm weather can start an early bloom, just as a cold snap can delay it,” Alex de Weese, a Times reader who lived in Tokyo for four years, wrote in an e-mail message.

Mr. de Weese gave other helpful advice, like pointing out that the blossoms usually last 10 days and that once the bloom begins, the nightly news features live reports on the status of the blossoms. Most of the major parks are crowded with tourists during the day, but the trees are also beautifully lighted at night. Ueno Park in Tokyo is a popular spot for viewing, he said, though he prefers the nearby Yanaka Cemetery. “But the nice thing about Tokyo, and many cities I’ve visited in Japan, is the ubiquity of cherry trees,” Mr. de Weese said. “I’ve often happened upon spectacular trees in a tiny tucked-away park or lining otherwise unremarkable streets.”

Since you may need to give yourself a good date range for your trip if you don’t want to miss the blossoms, you will have time for plenty of other activities in and around the city.
