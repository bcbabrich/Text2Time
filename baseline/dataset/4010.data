To the Editor:

I write to take issue with your assertion (London Journal, June 27) that the European soccer championship at Wembley and the tennis tournament at Wimbledon exemplify class distinctions in England and to offer myself, an Englishman abroad, as proof that this is a sweeping generalization. Wash the greasepaint off a yob, or soccer fan's, face, and a doctor or lawyer will likely emerge. Remove the topper from a young toff, and he may become a soccer fan again.

You quote Liverpool University's Rogan Taylor as saying that "if you think people who play tennis in England would have anything to do with people who play football, you're in cloud-cuckoo-land."

Obviously he knows England. But I myself forfeited a game of tennis yesterday to watch the English football team, sadly, lose. And what credibility can be attributed to a man with the title of Soccer Research Unit director (surely he means football or he's no Liverpudlian).

I have been a regular at the regatta at Henley and at Wimbledon while also frequenting soccer matches at Old Trafford and White Hart Lane. Many faces I meet at one place I meet again at the others; professionals (including journalists), captains of industry, university-educated with few exceptions. Sport transcends class. Ladies Day at Ascot does not automatically confer status; neither does a love of football consign one to the proles.
