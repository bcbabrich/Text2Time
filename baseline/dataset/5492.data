LIKE FINE WINE, PREMIUM WHISKY should be sipped and savored. And, like fine wine, each variety and brand of premium whisky is distinguished by its own color, bouquet, flavor, texture and lingering taste.

If great wine is in the grape, great whisky is in the grain. ''No amount of aging will make good whisky out of an inferior batch of grain,'' wrote Alexis Lichine, the author of influential wine books, in his ''Alexis Lichine's New Encyclopedia of Wines & Spirits.''

The grains used by whisky makers include corn, rye, wheat, barley and malted, or germinated, barley. They are mashed with water - regional differences add to the unique character of each whisky - and fermented. The resulting potion is distilled - evaporated and recondensed - to remove impurities and produce the heady spirit that the Celts named uisce beathadh (ISH-ke-BA-ha), the water of life.

But aging is crucial, too. Maturing whisky draws complexity and color from a long sleep in wooden barrels. That's why all premium whiskies are aged in cask at least 10 and as many as 25 years - way above the minimum two to four years generally required by the laws of whisky-producing countries. (Unlike wine, whisky's evolution stops as soon as it is bottled, though there are very subtle changes once the bottle is opened.) Which grains are used, and how they are processed, blended and aged, varies from country to country, region to region and distillery to distillery. The result is an array of distinctly different spirits available in the United States. Aficionados generally consider America's bourbon and Scotland's single-malt whiskies to be the best of the premiums. They are followed by blended Scotch whiskies (the most widely available in this country), Irish whisky and, finally, Tennessee sour-mash and Canadian whiskies. All are excellent and suitable not only as aperitifs, but as after-dinner drinks as well. Bourbon had its beginnings in Bourbon County, Ky., during colonial times, and is still produced primarily in that state. It is made from a mixture of grains that, by Federal law, must be at least 51 percent corn; at least 25 percent of that mash is usually drawn from a previous distillation, which sours over time. This ''sour mash'' process makes continuity of character possible.
