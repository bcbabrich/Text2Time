The Microsoft Corporation and the 3Com Corporation said that they would jointly develop and market software to allow a new generation of personal computers to communicate with one another.

The software, known as the OS/2 LAN Manager, is an extension of the OS/2 operating system, the basic software that will run the International Business Machines Corporation's new PS/2 personal computers. The LAN manager will coordinate the connection of such machines onto local area networks to send data from one computer to another or to share peripherals such as printers. I.B.M has not endorsed the software.
