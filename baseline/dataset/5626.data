Iraq said today that two Iranian airmen defected with their American-made F-4 Phantom jet fighter and landed safely at an Iraqi air base.

The state-run Baghdad radio, monitored in Bahrain, quoted an Iraqi military spokesman as identifying the pilot and co-pilot as Ahmed Murad Talibi and Hassan Nagafi Habibullah.

The spokesman said the Iranians gave their ranks as major and captain, the radio reported.

There was no comment from Iran.
