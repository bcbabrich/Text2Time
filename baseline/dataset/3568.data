After they lost by a touchdown last Sunday to the Colts -- when a potential tying pass went off Wayne Chrebet's hands in the end zone -- linebacker Bryan Cox thought about having come close all season. ''If you get beat by 50 points,'' he said, ''you say, 'We got whupped.' If you get beat like this, you say, 'Coulda, woulda, shoulda.' ''

Who can blame the Jets, or their fans, for this kind of thinking?

''You think about the Oakland game,'' Chrebet said. That was a 1-point loss in a game in which the Jets had a 20-10 lead in the final period. With 26 seconds left the Raiders produced a touchdown for the victory.

That kind of numbing loss has battered the Jets repeatedly this year. It is a team with a defense that has given up fewer points than 23 other clubs, and yet does not win its share of games. While the Jets' losses have come tantalizingly close to being victories, the victories have been struggles because of the diminished offense. The Jets have not won a game this season by more than 10 points.

Chrebet is still playing, and so are Keyshawn Johnson and Curtis Martin, who is tied for the conference lead in rushing. ''No matter how many stars you have, you have to mesh,'' Chrebet said. ''The worst thing to happen is a bunch of injuries at one position. Look at quarterback, look at right tackle.''

From the moment Vinny Testaverde was injured in the opening game, everything changed. Rick Mirer was tried, then Ray Lucas, then Mirer again, then Lucas again. Chrebet missed the first five games with a foot injury. Right tackle Jason Fabini's season ended with a knee injury in the ninth game. His replacement, Ryan Young, was hurt in the next game, and Siupeli Malamala came out of retirement to start at the position last Sunday.
