LONDON, Nov. 2 (Reuters)— Najeeb Halaby, the president of Pan American World Airways, suggested today that prospec tive buyers of the Concorde, the British‐French supersonic airliner, be given a chance to try the plane in passenger serv ice before deciding whether to buy it.

In an interview in Tuesday's issue of. The Financial Times, which appeared tonight, Mr. Halaby said he thought a small group of the world's major air lines should be allowed to fly the Concorde before it went into quantity production.

Mr. Halaby said this would make sure the aircraft was safe, economically sound and socially acceptable. He stressed that his proposal was not a delaying tactic so that the American supersonic transport could catch up.
