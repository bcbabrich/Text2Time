WRISTON--Kathryn "Kathy" Dineen of New York City, Sherman, CT and Boynton Beach, FL, passed away suddenly on Sunday morning, September 28, 2014, from complications from a fall at Deer Pond Farm, her house in Sherman, CT. Kathy is predeceased by her beloved husband, Walter B. Wriston, former CEO of Citibank, who passed away in 2005. Kathy's greatest joy in life was the time she spent with Walter working on Deer Pond Farm which they planned to have maintained as a nature preserve. Kathy was born in Syracuse, NY, on March 1, 1939, to the late Robert Emmet Dineen and Carolyn Bareham Dineen. She is survived by her loving sister, the Honorable Carolyn Dineen King, of the 5th Circuit United States Court of Appeals, and devoted brother, Robert E. Dineen, Jr. She is predeceased by the cherished brother, Laurence Joseph Dineen, who died of leukemia at age 7 years. She is also survived by Walter's daughter, Catherine "Cassy" Wriston Quintal, her husband, Richard Quintal and their children, Christopher W. Quintal, his wife, Sara, and Barbara Catherine "Katy" Quintal, all of whom she cared for dearly. In addition, she is survived by her brotherin-law, the Honorable Thomas M. Reavley, her sister-in-law, Jeanne C. Olivier, and three nephews, James D., Philip D. and Stephen E. Randall and two grand-nieces. She spent her childhood years in Syracuse and also in Milwaukee, WI. She later attended and graduated from Smith College in 1960 and from the University of Michigan Law School in 1963. In her early career, she practiced law at the New York law firm of Shearman & Sterling LLP. Later in her professional career, she served on the corporate boards of Federated Department Stores, Goodyear, Northwestern Mutual, Southern Pacific, Stanley Works, Union Carbide and WR Grace & Co. and on the boards of professional organizations, including the American Arbitration Association and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. She also served as a trustee of the Financial Accounting Foundation, the Practising Law Institute, Fordham University and the John A. Hartford Foundation. During the last decade of her life, she spent a tremendous amount of her time in support of many charitable causes. As her many friends and family know, her personal and financial support spanned many causes, such as nature conservation, medical research, educational institutions such as the Fletcher School of Tufts University, Syracuse University College of Law and Hobart and William Smith Colleges, and programs to feed the elderly and poor.
