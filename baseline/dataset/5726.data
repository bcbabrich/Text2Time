A Federal bankruptcy judge in Washington eased the way yesterday for United Press International to pay its 1,298 employees.

At the same time, Judge George Bason of United States Bankruptcy Court turned down an effort by two principal owners to sell the financially ailing news service to an investor group led by a Miami savings and loan institution.

The funds to cover the April 27 checks for two weeks' pay, totaling $1.38 million, will be provided in part by the Foothill Capital Corporation of Los Angeles, which has been U.P.I.'s principal lender. A good deal of the money for the payroll will come from payments from U.P.I.'s newspaper and other clients, but lawyers said Foothill would open a revolving credit line of up to $4 million to make up the rest.

Ray Wechsler, the president of U.P.I., said checks of up to $2,000 would be made available Thursday for immediate deposit or cashing.
