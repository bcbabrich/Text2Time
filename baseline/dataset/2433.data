Dancers Win Asturias Prize

The Russian ballerina Maya Plisetskaya, below, and the Spanish ballet star Tamara Rojo have become the first dancers to win the Prince of Asturias Award for the Arts in its 25-year history, Agence France-Presse reported. Praising their "perfect technique," the prize jury called the winners "the most brilliant ballerinas in the history of the dance world." The Moscow-born Ms. Plisetskaya, who turns 80 in November, joined the Bolshoi Ballet as a soloist in 1943; in the 1980's and 90's, she directed several dance companies, including the Ballet Lirico Nacional of Spain. Ms. Rojo, 31, who was born in Montreal and holds Spanish citizenship, is a principal dancer with the Royal Ballet in Britain. Each of the prizes, given by the Prince of Asturias Foundation and named for Crown Prince Felipe of Asturias, heir to the Spanish crown, carries an award of $61,000.

Michael Jackson Plays the Palace

Where is Michael Jackson? In the tiny Persian Gulf kingdom of Bahrain, The Associated Press reported. According to an official close to the royal circle, Mr. Jackson, on his first overseas trip since being acquitted last month of charges that included child molesting, arrived with his three children on a private plane from Europe on Wednesday night for an indefinite stay. "He's come here to retreat and relax and enjoy the calmness of Bahrain," the official said, adding that Mr. Jackson had chosen Bahrain because his brother Jermaine had previously visited it. Another official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Jackson, on a "very, very private" visit, was in a royal palace as a guest of Sheik Abdullah bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the king's son, who is a friend of Jermaine. Agence France-Presse reported that the sheik, a lyricist, and Jermaine announced plans in January to gather Western singers for a collective performance of a charity peace song they were writing.
