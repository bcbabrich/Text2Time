The Egyptian Government said today that it had foiled a plot by Muslim militants to kill 12 prominent Government officials and bomb eight Government buildings.

Interior Minister Hassan al-Alfi, who was wounded in an assassination attempt earlier this year, said in an interview with the newspaper Al Ahram that a raid on Wednesday by more than 2,000 police and paramilitary forces on an island in the Nile near the southern city of Asyut had resulted in the arrest of scores of suspects from the militant Islamic Group.

Mr. Alfi said the raid turned up maps and diagrams of the routes followed by several officials and some public figures who have attacked militant fundamentalist views. Backing From Abroad

Mr. Alfi said there was also evidence of financial support and contacts between the suspects and four other Middle East countries. He would not identify the targets of the plot or the countries involved.
