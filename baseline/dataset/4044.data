''The retail location was disappointing,'' he said. ''We had fewer visitors and sales than here at Lenz,'' which is on Main Road (Route 25). He did not dismiss the idea of finding a new retail location on the South Shore but said he would ''not look for one very actively at this time.'' Mr. Carroll also expressed doubts about whether ''Sagpond Vineyards' success notwithstanding,'' the South Fork was as viable a viticultural -- grape growing --area as the North Fork. There are two other wineries on the South Fork, Sagpond in Sagaponack and Duck Walk in Water Mill. (A new label, Channing Daughters Vineyard, owned by Walter and Molly Channing of Bridgehampton, is making its debut this fall. The wine is made by Lenz.) The North Fork has 14 wineries, and more seem to be on the way.

''The South Fork has a shorter growing season than the North Fork, it is harder to get grapes to ripen there and you need early ripening grapes,'' Mr. Carroll said. ''I am not willing to do a Duck Walk -- to buy property and plant vineyards.'' He was referring to a sizeable investment in replanting defunct vineyards made by Dr. Herodotus Damianos, the owner of Pindar Vineyards in Peconic, after he purchased the bankrupt Le Reve winery in 1994 and renamed it Duck Walk.

A further complication, Mr. Carroll said, is that, as a condition for permitting a winery to be established, the Town of Southampton requires that at least 75 percent of the grapes used in its products must be grown in the town.

What went wrong?

''The quality of the Bridgehampton wines already in bottles was not as high as the Lenz wine that we were used to producing and selling,'' Mr. Carroll said. ''I thought that in the wholesale area, my people could sell Lenz and Bridgehampton, but that proved not to be a good assumption. The differences in quality --and the prices, which were close together, made it hard.

''What I should have done was to have discounted the wine and used the cash flow to buy new grapes and thereby make better wine. But this didn't dawn on me until the beginning of 1996, by which time it was a bit late in the game, with the lease expiration coming up in September.''

Mr. Greenfield, who has a summer home in Amagansett and is a partner in a Manhattan-based company that composes music and jingles for television and radio, planted vines in 1979. His first commercial vintage was in 1982, and he opened the winery the next year. (It was preceded by the Hargrave Vineyard in Cutchogue in 1973 and Lenz in 1978.)

Over the years, the Bridgehampton Winery, always a boutique operation, won more than 150 medals in competitions. Its chardonnays have often been attractive, especially those made by its winemaker of 11 years, Richard Olsen-Harbich, who is now with Jamesport Vineyards. He was one of the earliest producers of sophisticated barrel fermented chardonnay on the East End.
