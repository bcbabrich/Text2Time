“Partisan,” in title at least, carries a whiff of the wild history of the Balkans. There is a postwar air to the opening scenes of Gregori (Vincent Cassel) salvaging pieces of broken furniture. He already has mattresses. Lots of mattresses. And eventually a compound with a harem of weirdly trusting women devoted to being baby machines despite Gregori’s lack of personal magnetism.

In a wavering accent that is sometimes Borat, sometimes generic American game-show host and sometimes Christopher Walken (as himself and as “S.N.L.” ’s Continental), Gregori lectures his growing brood, educates them and teaches them to shoot, using balloons as targets. He is training them to defend against “the outsiders,” he says, but never specifies what they have to fear.

Usually, partisans stand for something, but in this movie, which is stripped of a specific time frame and relevant geopolitical context, the term becomes hollow. The screenwriters, Ariel Kleiman (who is also the director) and Sarah Cyngler, have cut their story loose from any real significance, leaving us with Gregori, who has no discernible political views and no unifying beliefs, even delusional ones. Without this foundation for the character, the actor doesn’t stand a chance. As a cult leader, he is full of grand gestures but as aimless as a tiny plastic man in a terrarium.

Eventually, he sends the children on assignment as assassins. The teenage Alexander (Jeremy Chabriel) goes on the job equipped with baby blue cotton balls as ear plugs. As adolescent boys should, he begins to question his elders. What have his targets done — the shopkeepers and mechanics he is sent to kill? Why should they die?
