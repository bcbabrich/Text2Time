The first group of the 7,500 striking employees of the Weyerhaeuser Company to vote on a new contract offered by the company overwhelmingly rejected the proposal today.

The vote, by Local 3-130 of the International Woodworkers of America, was 420 to 6, said the local's business agent, Steve Fluke.

The company, the woodworkers union and the Lumber, Production and Industrial Workers concluded negotiations on the company proposal Friday, and the unions agreed to put it to a vote without recommending that the workers approve it.

Under the proposal for a two-year contract, workers would take a $4.30 reduction in pay. The average hourly wage at Weyerhaeuser is $21. A proposed new profit-sharing plan would allow workers to recoup some of the cut if company profits improved.
