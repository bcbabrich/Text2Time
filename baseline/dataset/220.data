Irena Szewinska, a sprinter and long jumper who won seven medals in five Olympic Games, tying an Olympic women’s record and becoming a national hero in Poland, died on Friday at a hospital in Warsaw. She was 72.

The cause was cancer, said Henryk Urbas, the press spokesman for the Polish Olympic Committee.

Szewinska’s athletic accomplishments and long run of Olympic appearances led many to consider her one of the greatest Polish athletes of the 20th century. In a tribute on Twitter, President Andrzej Duda of Poland called her “the first lady of Polish sport,” and Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki called her “an inspiration for generations of Polish athletes.”

A versatile, indefatigable athlete, Szewinska set multiple world records; at one point she had the fastest times in the 100-, 200- and 400-meter sprints. She stood a reedy 5 feet 9 inches tall and had a devastating kick, or last burst of speed, that sometimes let her snatch victory by a stride.

Szewinska (pronounced sha-VEEN-ska) competed in her first Olympic Games in Tokyo in 1964, when she was 18. She won silver medals in the 200-meter race and the long jump and a gold in the 400-meter relay.
