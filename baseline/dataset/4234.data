With his baseball cap turned backward and a silver earring bobbing as he strummed a few chords on an air guitar, 29-year-old Philip Weck was not your typical casino customer. But then again, this was not your typical Vegas hot spot: music by Pearl Jam pumped through the sound system and an electronic board above a bank of slot machines counted the diminishing number of acres of rain forest left on mother earth.

"It's more like a party than a casino," Mr. Weck observed, taking a break from a post-midnight romp at the roulette table in the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino here. "It's more familiar to people like me than the Strip."

You say you want a revolution? By most standards, the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, which opened with high-decibel pomp last spring, is less than radical. An affiliate of the Hard Rock Cafes, it bills itself as the spot in Las Vegas for people who do not like Las Vegas, but it is ultimately a place to eat, drink and gamble, with plenty of buxom cocktail waitresses.

When it opened, there was only a hope that a younger crowd would discover Vegas, and that if it did, the newcomers would spend freely. Now there are answers to both questions. The hotel says that it turns away as many as 300 people seeking reservations every weekend, and that the Hard Rock's revenues are running more than 50 percent ahead of projections.
