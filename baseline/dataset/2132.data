Out-of-towners traveling to New York City specifically to commit suicide have accounted for 5.3 percent of city suicides and more than 10 percent of all Manhattan suicides since 1990, according to a new research study. The two highest concentrations of such suicides took place near the George Washington Bridge, in Upper Manhattan, and in the Midtown tourism district, which includes Times Square, the Empire State Building and other skyscrapers, and most of the city’s major hotels.



Nonresidents committed 21 to 40 suicides in each of those two areas from 1990 to 2004, according to the study, which is to be presented on Monday to the American Public Health Association at its annual meeting in Washington. The research paper [pdf], “Suicide Tourism in Manhattan, New York City, 1990–2004,” appears in the November/December issue of The Journal of Urban Health.

“These data suggest that there are individuals who travel to a distant location and take their lives,” said David Vlahov, director of the Center for Urban Epidemiologic Studies at the New York Academy of Medicine, which released the study today. (The report’s use of the provocative phrase “suicide tourism” caught the attention of The Daily News this morning.)

The academy, which publishes the urban health journal, called the study the “first known effort to document the number, and characteristics, of individuals who travel substantial distances to commit suicide.” The lead author is Charles Gross, who is affiliated with the Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University and the clinical psychology program at the City University of New York Graduate Center.

Researchers from the academy and other institutions reviewed by hand records of all suicides in New York City from 1990 to 2004, poring over files in the office of the city’s chief medical examiner, which is responsible for assessing all unnatural deaths in the city.

Suicide is considered a major, and preventable, public health problem. In the United States, suicide is the 11th leading cause of death, accounting for for 32,439 deaths in 2004, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Anyone in a suicidal crisis is urged to call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255).

The new study suggests that some people may “seek the opportunity for suicide outside their proximal environment and often in well-known places.”

Between 1990 and 2004, there were a total of 7,634 suicides in New York City: 94.7 percent were committed by city residents and 5.3 percent (or 407) by nonresidents. Of the 407 nonresident suicides, 274 occurred in Manhattan, accounting for more than 10 percent of all the suicides in Manhattan.

The most common methods of suicide for the Manhattan nonresidents were: jumping (from a tall place), hanging, overdose, drowning, and firearms. The most common locations included hotels and commercial buildings, followed by outside locations like bridges, parks and streets.

In a statement, Dr. Vlahov said he hoped his research would assist with suicide prevention efforts. “As with locations such as the Golden Gate Bridge and the Eiffel Tower that are repeatedly used for suicide, certain locales in Manhattan and other urban areas may require further prevention efforts such as greater public awareness, surveillance, available hot line phones, and suicide barriers,” he said.

In a phone interview today, Dr. Herbert Hendin, a psychiatrist and a leading authority on suicides, said the phenomenon of “hot spots” for suicide has been well documented. (In October 2003, for example, The New Yorker published an extensive article about the large number of suicides at the Golden Gate Bridge.)

Dr. Hendin, the president and medical director of Suicide Prevention International, said there is a commonly held, but incorrect, view that suicide barriers are ineffective because people will find a way to kill themselves anyway. In fact, he said, barriers have been shown to be effective; physical deterrents have often dissuaded people who wanted to kill themselves in prominent locations to attract publicity.

Dr. Hendin, who helped found the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, did raise some caveats about the new study — particularly its title and the use of the term “suicide tourism.”

“I think that’s silly, because that implies they came here to be tourists and somehow were unhappy here,” he said. “It’s a terribly unhelpful title.”

Dr. Hendin also said that the term “nonresidents” needed clarification. He noted that many people live in the city’s suburbs and work in Manhattan; should such people properly be considered nonresidents? Also, he said, there is not much comparative research that would show whether the proportion of out-of-town suicides in New York City is higher than in other places.

Nonetheless, the new study does present interesting details for mental health experts. Nonresidents who committed suicide tended to be younger than their resident counterparts: 47.5 percent of nonresident suicides were committed by people under the age of 35 (compared with 29.4 percent among suicides of city residents in Manhattan), and only 2.6 percent of nonresident suicides were committed by people over 75 years old (compared with 10.9 percent among residents).

Nonresident suicide subjects also tended to be more often white or Asian than resident suicides, and less often black or Hispanic. Male victims accounted for nearly 80 percent of nonresident suicides in Manhattan, compared with 70 percent of suicides among residents.

Of the nonresident suicides, 59.5 percent were committed in locations coded by the chief medical examiner’s office as “other inside,” such as hotels and other nonresidential interiors; 25.5 percent were committed in outside locations such as parks, streets and bridges. Among suicides of city residents in Manhattan, the vast majority (75.1 percent) occurred inside a home.
