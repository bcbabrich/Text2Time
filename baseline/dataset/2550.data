Jesus Chavez will go home to Austin, Tex., on Monday without the World Boxing Council junior lightweight championship, but with newfound esteem.

Chavez lost his 130-pound title to Erik Morales by a unanimous decision on Saturday night but fought almost the entire 12 rounds using mostly one hand. He injured his right shoulder in the second round.

''That was one of the most courageous performances I've ever seen,'' said Johnny Bos, a New York fight manager who watched the bout on HBO. ''That's the kind of thing that gives credence to this game, that makes it worthwhile.''

Fighters have been injured and kept going many times; it happens almost every time Arturo Gatti and Floyd Mayweather Jr. fight. But Chavez, who did not seem to have a chance to win after the opening round, when he hurt Morales with a right hand to the chin, showed special grit.
