The driver of a stolen tractor-trailer truck led the police on a 50-mile chase up the New Jersey Turnpike yesterday until he was arrested after stopping at the George Washington Bridge tollbooths, The Associated Press reported.

The truck, which was reported stolen Saturday in Virginia, was loaded with electronics equipment. It was spotted by New Jersey state police near Cranbury. The police said the driver, Eliezer Martinez, was part of a robbery ring that was to unload the goods in New York City.
