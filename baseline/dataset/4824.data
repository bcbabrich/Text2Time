In the 1980's, a new generation of Chinese film makers won international respect for works that were innovative and visually stunning, among them "Ju Dou," which was nominated for an Academy Award this year. But this summer's movies, particularly three that are strongly backed by the Government and the army, have a Maoist tinge that apparently is the wave of the future in Chinese arts, at least as long as the present leaders are in power.

The most important of the movies is Part 1 of "Decisive Battles," probably the costliest film ever made by a Chinese studio. Parts 2 and 3 are to come out later this year. The trilogy, depicting battles in 1948 and 1949 that let the Communists take power, is said to be the pet project of China's 84-year-old President, Yang Shangkun. Not surprisingly, Mr. Yang is a dashing young man in the movie. 125,000 Extras

Part 1 is three and a half hours of battle scenes interspersed with glowing portrayals of most of China's present leaders. There are no compelling characters, but there are a lot of non-compelling ones: the Army provided 125,000 soldiers for battles scenes. The trilogy is believed to have cost the Army more than $15 million -- reportedly more than all the 100 other films that China produces annually.

A shorter summer epic is "Kaitian Pidi," which was officially translated as "An Epoch-Making Event" but which translates more literally as "The Creation of the Heavens and the Earth." The topic is the Communist Genesis: the forming of the Chinese Communist Party.

The third of the trio is "Mao Zedong and His Son," which deals with Mao's grief when he lost his son to an American air raid in the Korean War. The film is unusual in that it portrays Mao as a human rather than a god. Though it is clearly propaganda with anti-American overtones, it leaves many Chinese in tears. For all his unchallenged political power, Mao is unable to break the news of his son's death to the son's wife.
