Not long ago, behavioral advice books had a pleasant pluck-and-luck air. They told the reader how to achieve some goal or inner harmony - in personal relationships or out in the marketplace - by taking 5 or 10 common-sense steps. Several of them offered helpful tips to people unable to cope with the trials of daily life. Mainly, these books were cheerful; they had good manners.

Lately, a different breed of advice book has appeared that is aggressive if not downright hostile. The underlying philosophy - invariably referred to as the bottom line - amounts to advice on how to gull your fellow-man before he does it to you. One current title, ''Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive,'' boasts on its jacket that it tells you how to ''outsell, outmanage, outmotivate and outnegotiate your competition.'' In the process, you become part of the shark species, too.

Now comes ''Leadership Secrets of Attila the Hun,'' which raises the stakes even higher by choosing as its role model one of the great murderers of the barbarian world. This small, stretched-out book is intended to serve as a guide for the business executive. The reader comes across a modern phrase such as ''he leveraged its power,'' one of many anachronisms more suitable for the board room. It is unlikely that the Huns spoke that way around the campfires after they had sacked villages and towns in Italy and Gaul. As a spoof, the book might be fun; but Wess Roberts, its humorless author, isn't kidding.
