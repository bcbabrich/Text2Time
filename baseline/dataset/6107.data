The campaign for Governor of New Jersey, now in its last five weeks, finally has produced some heat, and in the process seems to have awakened the state's volatile electorate to the elements of high drama present in this contest:

Governor Byrne, a 721,000‐vote winner four years ago who lost most of his luster early in his administration, had to beat nine rivals to get the Democratic nomination last June. Now he is trying to overtake his Republican opponent, State Senator Raymond H. Bateman, who has a 7‐point lead, according to the polls.

There is a strong emotional issue, the state income tax, championed by Mr. Byrne and denounced by Mr. Bateman.

Interest in the outcome extends to the White House since New Jersey and Virginia are the only states in the nation with governorship races this year and the results could be interpreted as the first referendum on the Carter Administration. President Carter recently campaigned in the state with Mr. Byrne and said he would be back before the election Nov. 8.

Not only the tempo but the nature of the campaign has changed. The Governor, the target for so long of harsh criticism over the income tax, went on the attack two weeks ago when Mr. Bateman offered a program that he says would enable him to run the state for the next four years without the tax. Mr. Byrne ridiculed the plan and its author, reminding audiences that Mr. Bateman had voted for an income tax in the past, and generally succeeded in putting his opponent on the defensive. Political observers could only wonder, however, how all this was affecting the state's inscrutable, so‐far passive electorate.
