The Department of Health and Human Services is quietly circulating a proposal that could result in the closing of more than half the nation's 1,340 Social Security field offices, Representative Edward R. Roybal, Democrat of California, said today.

The field offices represent the first line of contact for most Social Security recipients and is the place they apply for benefits or arrange for changes.

''I have now learned that the Administration is circulating a plan which would close Social Security offices with staffs of less than 15 and would possibly shut down those offices with staffs of less than 25 workers,'' Mr. Roybal said in a news release.

Jim Brown, a spokesman for the Social Security Administration, said the agency was not planning to close a specific number of facilities but added, ''We are looking at all the installations we have to see if they are serving the public best.''
