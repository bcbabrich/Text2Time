The Yankees’ manager has weighed in on Alex Rodriguez’s Shout Heard ‘Round The World from Wednesday night’s game in Toronto. And he didn’t like it.

“It’s probably something he shouldn’t have done,” Joe Torre told reporters in the Yankees’ dugout just now. “But it’s over with. I don’t sense he’s going to do it again. Just the reaction probably told him that. He may have been excited about the fact we were leading the ballgame. It’s probably inappropriate to do it at the time he did it.”

Of the Blue Jays, Torre said, “They were angry, no question. I can’t say I blame them.”

Torre, whose initial reaction bordered on a defense of A-Rod, said he discussed the play with him after the game on Wednesday and got the impression that Rodriguez will not do it again. Rodriguez did not make himself available to reporters after Torre’s remarks.
