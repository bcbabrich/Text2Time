No one had a radio. Our cellphones didn’t work. And it was clear that no bikes would be coming back to get us.

I was in one of the most beautiful settings on earth. But that fact intruded on my thoughts only occasionally. We walked for nine and a half hours, mostly in water. The poncho turned out to be porous. The new boots, soaking wet, were heavy and began to kill my toes. I had expected heat. But the water was cold. I was shivering. As with every other time I have ended up in a dangerous situation while reporting, my mind went over and over where I had made the stupid mistake that had landed me in such a spot.

Eventually, some of the rangers who had gone ahead on bikes waded back to help us out of there. Perhaps because I was old enough to be their mother, the soldiers and rangers seemed unsure of how to deal with me. But one finally offered me his hand. I wondered later whether he regretted it. I did not let go of him for at least two hours as he inched forward first, trying to guide me to solid footing.

Over the next two days (yes, one night turned into two) I watched these young men work so hard to do their job right. Some showed a deep knowledge and love of the rain forest they were trying to protect. But it was a shock to see how poorly equipped and vastly outmanned they were.

Most spoke not a word of English. But even so, as I slipped down the 15-foot muddy embankment to get into a motorized canoe or got my boots stuck in the quicksand-like beach along the river, one of them always seemed there to hold my hand.

My Fitbit didn’t survive the soaking. The clothes I wore and slept in were so stained with gooey muck that they would go straight into the garbage. I am in the process of losing one of my toe nails.

But as we headed for a different path home, I knew I had gotten what I wanted for my story. Going up the river away from the miners, we were in a still-pristine area. There, at dawn, we spotted a jaguar in the water swimming from shore to shore. The men turned off the boat engine to watch as the animal climbed out on a pebbly stretch.

Then they burst out laughing. Our jaguar was fat. In this area of the reserve, at least for now, all was well.
