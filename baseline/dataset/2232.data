As a student in Baghdad, I am mostly focused on my studies. It wasn’t always this way. Before I started my blog in February 2005, my studies were the only thing I thought about; my whole life was forming around them. That changed when I started blogging, making online friends, and meeting people outside my country. But as time passed, I realized that I was keeping this online part of my life hidden from my offline friends. I discovered that I could not really explain what blogging was all about to any of my friends. So now I am living two different lives, one online and one offline. It sometimes seems that I keep a different personality for each of them.

One of the reasons I keep my two lives separate is that I want to be able to speak freely on my blog. If the people I know knew about my blog, I might not be able to write everything I want to write. What if I were angry with someone or some party and I wanted to be hard on them in my blog? I still remember the mayhem I had in my online life when I said in my blog that I was in agreement with the purpose of the war: I had quite a few nasty e-mails in the next few days. So I was just glad all this was happening where it really did not hurt. Because here in Iraq, people don’t send e-mails, they send bullets.

I also do not like speaking English in public. I worry that someone might jump to the conclusion that I am a spy or something. Some people automatically assume that speaking English is something an honest Iraqi should not do, which is just absurd. For this reason, when I make outside phone calls or do an interview, either by phone or by Internet, I do it from my home.

I also find that I am comfortable talking about my offline life to my online friends, but not talking to my offline friends about my online life. I have exchanged real photos with my close online friends, and have met a few Iraqis among them. I have found out that all of my online friends do exactly as I do. They keep their online life away from their friends. They may tell their family, or just one close family member, but never someone they are not sure about.

There are times when I focus on one life more than the other. Back in December, when I and many other Iraqis were voting for a government, I put more focus on the blogger than the student, because, in my opinion, that was the time the blogger mattered most. It was my time to tell the world what I did on that day, and why I did it. These days, I am putting a bit more time into the student because in about two weeks I am going to be having my finals. These matter to me very much because they will have a great effect on my degree — and even my career — in Civil Engineering.

However, I am still hoping for the day when I can walk down the street in Baghdad and say, “I blog.”
