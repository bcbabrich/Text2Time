DUBLIN, Saturday, Dec. 2—The Irish Parliament approved legislation cracking down on the Irish Republican Army last night, shortly after three explosions in the center of Dublin killed at least two people and injured more than 70.

The explosions, rare for the capital, came as Prime Minister John Lynch was struggling to win parliamentary approval of the tough antiterrorist measures. Before the blasts, the measure had been given little chance of passage.

On hearing the news of the explosions, Parliament recessed its third day of debate and leaders of the parties opposing the bill indicated that they would no longer stand in the way of passage.

When Parliament reconvened later, most of the Opposition members abstained, and the bill cleared the 144‐seat chamber by a vote of 70 to 23.
