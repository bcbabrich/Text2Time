Cellphones are a boon to stagecraft. With only a small clutch of electronics pressed to the head, characters can now convincingly perform monologues anywhere: in cars, on the beach, in the tub. ''Karen Sisco,'' which has its premiere tonight, exploits this device, spinning drama chiefly from close-ups on the radiantly made-up face of Carla Gugino, the show's star, as she bathes, paces and drives in Miami. And, all the while, talks into her flip-top mobile.

Sisco begins the pilot with a bad hangover. She is an alcoholic United States marshal who can't remember a recent shootout that knocked her out and garishly wounded her chest. As she tries to remember, the show joins its amnesia plot with a sleeping-with-the-enemy plot in a two-for-one evening of favorite action formulas.

''Karen Sisco'' is driven by a soundtrack of cool jazz -- easy listening that may remind viewers of being on hold. But on hold for what? The show seems to promise disclosures and entanglements, but by the end of the first episode nothing seems to have happened. An intricate romance simply evaporates, and Sisco gives no clue about why it even got started.

Still, your call is important to ABC, and it's worth standing by for the second episode of ''Karen Sisco,'' which will be shown next Wednesday. A prisoner sees an unexpected chance to escape his handler, and he flees. Sisco, who could have apprehended him, also accidentally lets him go. This time she is not morally remote or immune to change. Rather, she seems to have lost her virtuosity as a marshal even before the show can establish it.
