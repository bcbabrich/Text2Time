On the back of John C. Salvi 3d's black pickup was an oversized picture of an aborted fetus. It was a picture of Jesus Christ, Mr. Salvi told people.

His neighbors and co-workers today described the 22-year-old suspect in abortion clinic shootings, who was a student at the Portsmouth Beauty School, as quiet and withdrawn. They knew little about him, they said, other than that he was deeply religious and wanted to be a hairdresser. Even law-enforcement officials said today that they knew little about his background, although they said that he did not appear to be connected to any anti-abortion groups.

"He was just an oddball," said Rick Griffin, who had hired Mr. Salvi in May to sweep floors at Eccentric Hair, a beauty salon 10 miles north of here.

But on Dec. 23, said Mr. Griffin and others, Mr. Salvi erupted. A customer came into the store that day, said Doreen Potter, the manager of Eccentric Hair, "and John just ripped the guy's coat off, forcefully." Ms Potter added: "The guy asked for his jacket back, and John said, 'No, you can't have it.' Finally, John gave him his coat, and the guy left. John yelled, 'And don't you ever come back again, ever!' Then he sat down, with a smirk on his face."
