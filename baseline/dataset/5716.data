Broadly speaking, the growth of labor-intensive imports is not only inevitable but also desirable. Rising living standards have always depended on the ever more productive use of labor. Work by Americans that could be done as well but much more cheaply by Taiwanese or Turks represents, historically, a drag on the American economy. Moreover, the United States has a major foreign policy interest in cheap manufacture abroad. The growth and stability of developing economies - and their demand for American-made goods - depends on their exports of low-wage products.

Thanks to its flexible free-market system, America continues to create jobs as rapidly as they are destroyed by changing world market conditions. Virtually everyone who is put out of work by imports eventually finds other employment. For clothing workers who earn $5 or $6 an hour, the chances are that new jobs will pay as well or better.

But these abstractions are no comfort for the workers and communities that depend on garment making. If Americans want to continue to benefit from cheap imports, we must accept responsibility for what happens to these people and places. Congress tried in the 1970's, by offering supplementary unemployment benefits for workers dislocated by imports. But this worthy first try was quickly labeled ''burial insurance'' by union leaders. The program, inadequate though it was, has been allowed to lapse.

A better remedy, in keeping with free-market principles, would be to get serious about re-employing the dislocated and subsidizing their relocation. The Federal Government has never attempted systematically to match blue-collar workers with jobs in other regions, the way white-collar workers are now routinely served by private employment agencies. Nor has Washington ever offered to help with moving expenses or tried to encourage relocation by retailing information about schools and housing. Nor has it ever made an intelligent, enduring effort to teach new skills to those whose experience is no longer in demand.

A prudent and humane society should neither resist desirable change nor cast aside its victims. American industry has always been on the move. New England was thrice transformed from dependence on farming, fishing and commerce to shoe and textile manufacture, to education, high tech and insurance. We need such vital change to remain prosperous. It would be foolish to cement so many jobs into place in every town or state. But it is cruel and ultimately untenable to turn a deaf ear to those who need help in moving with the tides.
