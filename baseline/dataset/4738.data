Fernando Valenzuela got a raise to more than $2.5 million and Jim Gott and John Smiley became millionaires yesterday as the number of remaining salary arbitration cases dropped to 98.

Valenzuela and the Dodgers settled at $2.55 million. The 30-year-old left-hander, who earned $2.2 million last season, when he was 13-13 with a 4.59 e.r.a., had requested a salary of $2.7 million while the team offered $2.4 million.

Gott and the Dodgers agreed to a one-year contract for $1,725,000, more than double his 1990 salary of $840,000. Gott was 3-5 with a 2.90 e.r.a. and three saves in 50 relief appearances.

Smiley, a left-hander, settled with the Pittsburgh Pirates on a one-year contract worth $1.05 million, a raise of $210,000. He was 9-10 with a 4.64 e.r.a. in 25 starts. (AP)
