Ed McCurdy, a singer and songwriter who was a leading folk music figure in the 1950's, died on March 23. He was 81 and lived in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

At the height of the Depression, Mr. McCurdy left his family farm in Willow Hill, Pa., at 18 to become a gospel singer in Manhattan. He slept on floors and went days without food but always managed to pay for voice lessons. He left Manhattan and traveled across the nation, working as a gospel singer and announcer on various radio stations.

Influenced by Frank Sinatra, he decided to leave gospel for the secular pop world and try his luck as a nightclub singer. He headed north this time, working in Niagara Falls and Toronto. At a show in Vancouver, he met a dancer who was celebrating her 20th birthday with her fiancee. Three years later, that dancer became Mr. McCurdy's wife, Beryl.

In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Jim; two daughters, Dana and Maggie; and three grandchildren, all of New York.
