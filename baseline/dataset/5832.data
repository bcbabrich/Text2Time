Yonkers SchoolsCancel Recess

Yonkers public school students got a lesson in brinksmanship last week from the City Council and the school board, which have been fighting over a $12 million gap in the school budget. The council promised to provide the money last summer, but with the fiscal year half over and no additional money in sight, school officials decided two weeks ago to force the issue.

The board voted to shut all 32 schools for three weeks this month and to lay off 49 teachers and 89 other school employees in February.

At a meeting the next day, the City Council reaffirmed its pledge to add the $12 million to the $88 million school budget, but then voted to appropriate only $2 million. Council members, who said the schools had enough money to remain open until at least April, then voted to raise their own salaries by $2,600, or 16 percent.

Facing threatened lawsuits to keep schools open, officials of the city, which came close to default in July, last week reached an accord: Council members again pledged to close the gap and school officials promised that classes would resume as scheduled this week at the end of the Christmas vacation. Mayor Angelo R. Martinelli said $3 million would come from Federal revenue- sharing money, auctions of city property and parking fines; plans for finding the remaining $9 million were vague, he said, although the city may look for a state loan.
