He has made getting it under control his personal New Year's resolution. "I am scheduled very fully, which is one of the things we are trying to address in the New Year," Mr. Dinkins explained, "to leave a little more time for reflection,study and whatnot." He added, "I want to be as efficient as I can possibly be."

For the Mayor, the schedule is about control, and not seeming out of it. Publicly, Mr. Dinkins has been obliged to assert repeatedly that his administration has a grip on the city's depleted finances, budget deficits, crumbling infrastructure and crime. Repeatedly of late, he has chided senior aides, "Let's just try to figure out what we're doing ahead of time."

Privately, persistently -- and sometimes in salty language left over from his days as a marine -- the Mayor has upbraided the staff about his office's lack of control over his daily activities.

"He doesn't like the pressure of having one thing on top of the other," said one senior aide who asked not to be identified. "And he hates the unexpected." Those two prerequisites of his job were hardly eased by a schedule that throughout the year has placed him at two and sometimes three public events at once and cut short critical meetings. A Rather Remote Leader

Paradoxically, the man known as one of the friendliest, most obliging of politicians (of his days as city clerk, he has conceded, "The joke was, if I wasn't there, it wasn't official") has proved to be a rather remote leader. He has insisted -- because of time restraints and his own ingrained sense of order and propriety -- that heads of agencies report through deputy mayors. It has left many of them frustrated.
