Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.

The only thing foggier than war itself may be the path to its frightening, if too often exhilarating, outbreak. Indeed, the secession crisis and road to civil war took an enormous emotional toll on Americans of every persuasion and in every corner of the land. Few, however, expressed themselves as publicly or eloquently as Frederick Douglass. “I have never spent days so restless and anxious,” he said in an early April 1861, lecture at Rochester’s Spring Street A.M.E. Zion Church. “Our mornings and evenings have continually oscillated between the dim light of hope and the gloomy shadow of despair.”

It was a time of great activity for Douglass. Throughout the winter he had helped organize a weekly series of antislavery lectures on Sundays at the Spring Street church. Although he was himself the most frequent speaker, many other prominent abolitionists addressed the gatherings, including Susan B. Anthony, Parker Pillsbury and Jermain Loguen. Douglass also wrote fervidly: since he could not directly affect a policy that might now emerge from the turbulent atmosphere of Washington, he took to his pen for solace, and for spirit. As editor, orator and autobiographer, his words and the example of his own story were, after all, his only real weapons against slavery. But he also knew their power: throughout the 1850s Douglass had learned well that words were the currency of politics. Now even words, though, were in flux. “The strangest feature of this eventful drama,” he proclaimed, “is the complete inversion of the sense of…words.”

Rochester lay deep within Unionist territory, but the ebb and flow of national politics reached the church doors: the meetings had moved to Zion, which served a community of nearly 300 blacks, in late January after a convention of abolitionists meeting in Rochester’s majestic Corinthian Hall was disrupted by a mob and closed down by police. By early February, a white workingmen’s convention drew a large turnout to endorse sectional “compromise” in the crisis, which was precisely what Douglass and abolitionists most feared. On the other hand, on Feb. 18, a throng estimated at 15,000 gathered at the Rochester train station as President-elect Abraham Lincoln passed through on his storied, whistle-stop journey to Washington.

To abolitionists like Douglass, who dearly yearned for a breakup of the Union that might threaten slavery through unpredictable means and events, all was uncertain as Lincoln glided through town. A divided nation watched and awaited what the new president would do about the wayward “Confederate” states of the Deep South, which were busy seizing federal forts, arsenals, courts and post offices.

Douglass minced no words in announcing his own definition of the secessionists: They were “traitors and rebels” who had “robbed, plundered, insulted, spit upon, and defiled” the United States government, he angrily wrote in February. “Treason” and “Armed Rebellion,” he complained, were “now simply the sovereign right of Secession, and the execution of the Laws is now called ‘Coercion.’” To Douglass, the secessionists were the mortal enemies of the “Government” (which he began to capitalize), as well as of his cause of abolition. Traitors merited no quarter, and he repeatedly insisted on his own label for their movement – the “treasonable, Slaveholding Confederacy.”

But secessionist treason was “exceeded” by Northern acquiescence, Douglass contended, in “the sneaking cowardice and pitiful imbecility of the Government [the Buchanan administration], and the Northern people, who are mobbing down freedom of speech, crying ‘no coercion,’ and whining for compromise.” Douglass had been practicing this kind of rhetoric about slaveholders for years; by 1861, it was as if the secessionists had flipped his switch into overdrive.

By the eve of Lincoln’s inauguration March 4, Douglass’s “doubt and distraction” had all but consumed him. He was not yet connected to the Republican Party establishment and had no personal ties to Lincoln’s inner circle. He truly did not know which impulses or rumors about the new president’s impending actions to trust. Whatever Lincoln’s policy would be towards slavery and “our nation’s troubles,” he declared, it would “be a great relief to know.” Lincoln’s “stately silence” throughout the crisis left Douglass guessing, but he did take hope from the Illinoisan’s “cool and circumspect” resistance, thus far, to all major compromise measures bandied about in public debate. Grasping for confidence, Douglass said Lincoln had “not won deceitfully the title of Honest Old Abe.”

Tense, and writing from his lonely late winter outpost in Rochester, speaking for radical abolitionists and on Sundays to a small black congregation, as well as to his white antislavery neighbors and allies, Douglass worried that the “atmosphere of the Capitol” would yet infect the “moral health” of Lincoln and the Republicans. But with only days to wait for the inaugural message, Douglass simply offered that “all our hopes” were with the new president’s resolve. All along, he had yearned that the South’s “gigantic and systematized Treason” had, with time, irrevocably “bound up the fate of the Republic and that of the slave in the same bundle.” Neither he, nor anyone, quite knew yet the deep irony of that truth.
