He came back on the team charter at 6 A.M., his heart still heavy from going home to be with his mother in Oklahoma after she underwent surgery for cancer. John Starks had left the team earlier this season to be with the grandmother who raised him, a woman dealing with the latter stages of the disease.

And now this, another jolt from his insulated basketball world.

There were maybe 20,000 people at Madison Square Garden tonight who wanted and needed Starks to do what he has been doing so well for this franchise since he stopped bagging groceries after college. With their team on the brink, they needed yet one more emotional rescue from elimination.

But that phrase is for basketball. This was life. How do you concentrate on your job when the people who brought you into this world and raised you are seriously ill or dying?

Everyone will talk about last night's fight after Game 4, the most violent and enduring image from this ugly rivalry. But in the skewed little world of sport, Larry Johnson versus Alonzo Mourning was minuscule next to Starks's battle, the emotions tugging at him tighter than any Miami Heat player grabbing his jersey coming off a screen.
