The Government took actions today that would mildly stimulate Japan's economy, authorizing an income tax cut and adopting budget guidelines for 1988 that depart from the no-growth policies of recent years.

The tax reduction, worth $8.7 billion a year, ran into immediate political trouble because it was coupled with - and largely offset by - a new 20 percent tax on small savings accounts.

The Cabinet also approved a budget outline for the 1988 fiscal year, which starts April 1. It suggested that overall spending was not likely to change significantly, an indication of the willingness of Japan to adhere to its professed commitment to stimulating its economy.

In response to the Government's plan, opposition parties began a boycott of parliament similar to one earlier this year that ultimately forced the withdrawal of another tax plan - a severe political defeat for Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
