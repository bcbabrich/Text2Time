He is a mayor who likes golf rather than tennis and he is so good at it that he earns a decent living hitting fairways and making putts. He is also the only player on the Senior PGA Tour with two putters in his bag among the 14 clubs allowed.

Mayor Rocky Thompson of Toco, Tex., (pop. 138) used both putters so effectively today in the opening round of the $400,000 Nynex Commemorative at Sleepy Hollow Country Club that he shot his best round of the year, a six-under-par 64 on the 6,545-yard course.

With greens overly receptive because of heavy rain during the night and again this afternoon during a 1-hour-45-minute interruption of play, low scores were the norm among the 78 players in the event. But the scores of Thompson and Bob Charles were the lowest. Five Are a Shot Back

Bob Betley; Billy Casper, who eagled the par-5 15th; Bruce Crampton; Chi Chi Rodriguez and Walt Zembriski were one shot back of the co-leaders at 65.
