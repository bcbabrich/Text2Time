The John Birch Society, the group that has crusaded for 28 years against big government and what it views as a world Communist conspiracy, has come upon hard times.

The group is staggering with a $9 million deficit and for the first time is appealing widely for financial help.

In addition, the question of how much to criticize President Reagan has created an internal battle that has turned the widow of the society's founder, Robert F. Welch, against the group's new leadership.

''I have nothing to do with the society,'' said Marian P. Welch, who is in her 80's and living in a retirement home in Weston, near this Boston suburb where her husband had the society's headquarters. ''The people who are running it are not standing on what it started out to be at all.''
