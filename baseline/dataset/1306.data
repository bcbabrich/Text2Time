While insider trading cases have been attracting much of the financial headlines, there is another issue that will have a much greater effect on corporate bottom lines: bribery.

The British Ministry of Justice has announced guidelines for the implementation of the far-reaching Bribery Act of 2010, which goes into effect July 1.

Meanwhile, while the Securities and Exchange Commission is set this month to announce rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act to encourage whistleblowers to disclose information about corporate misconduct, most likely including violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

The Bribery Act is sure to drive up the costs of compliance programs for American companies doing business in Britain, while the Dodd-Frank Act’s whistleblower provisions may well render those programs superfluous, even though they will still be required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits individuals and companies from paying bribes to foreign officials to obtain or retain business in the country. It also requires corporations that file reports with the S.E.C. to maintain accurate books and records in accordance with the accounting rules.

The law, first adopted in 1977, has grown in importance over the past decade as the Justice Department, working with the S.E.C., has brought a number of cases against multinational companies for corrupt payments, resulting in millions of dollars of fines and penalties.

Britain’s Bribery Act is broader in some respects than the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, applying to any type of bribery, not just payments to foreign officials. The Bribery Act makes a company liable for the actions of those “associated” with a “commercial organization,” including any employee or agent who acts on its behalf, and the organization is strictly liable for any failure to prevent the bribery.

For American companies, a crucial facet of the Bribery Act is its application to any organization that “carries on a business” in Britain. The Ministry of Justice’s guidance is not particularly helpful on the scope of the law, noting that it would not apply to foreign company that did not have a “demonstrable business presence” in Britain, and that a company is not necessarily liable if it lists its shares on a British exchange or maintains a subsidiary in the country.

Rather than explaining what the law does cover, the guidance simply describes what might fall outside the Bribery Act, while noting that the courts will finally decide the issue. This provides little clarity about the scope of the law.

The Bribery Act provides a defense for a company accused of a violation if it can show it had in place “adequate procedures” to prevent an associated person from engaging in bribery, something the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act does not recognize as a basis to avoid liability.

The Ministry of Justice outlined six principles for preventing bribery that should guide companies in adopting or expanding a compliance program to help establish a defense to a charge. The principles focus on adequately assessing the risks of a violation and implementing a sufficiently rigorous program of prevention and monitoring.

While almost every publicly traded American company already has a compliance program in place, the potentially broad scope of the Bribery Act is likely to require companies doing any substantial amount of business in Britain to devote even greater resources to preventing bribery of any type, not just that involving foreign officials. Compliance is not cheap, of course, which means the lawyers, accountants and outside consultants who specialize in this field will see an uptick in business.

On this side of the Atlantic, the S.E.C.’s new whistleblower rules are likely to bring an increase in investigations because the incentives the Dodd-Frank Act provided to those who disclose valuable information about securities law violations. The act guarantees a payment to a whistleblower of at least 10 percent, and as much as 30 percent, of any monetary sanctions exceeding $1 million recovered as a result of the information provided.

Overseas bribery will be a prime target for whistleblowers because these types of payments are hard for companies to detect without some internal disclosure, and they can result in significant liabilities based on the amount of business affected by the corrupt transactions.

The S.E.C. proposed rules to implement the whistleblower program in November 2010 that drew howls of protest from corporations. The biggest complaint is that the new program may undermine compliance programs already in place by encouraging employees to bypass internal corporate reporting in favor of going directly to the government to report misconduct.

One proposed solution is to require employees to report any potential violation of the securities laws to the corporate employer along with the S.E.C., and the commission can defer to the company in the first instance to conduct an internal investigation and report on any violations uncovered.

One drawback to this approach is that it puts almost complete faith in a company to address wrongdoing, which Congress did not have when it drafted the whistleblower provision to encourage a greater flow of information to the S.E.C.

In a recent speech, the S.E.C.’s enforcement director, Robert Khuzami, said: “We look forward to implementing the whistleblower program in a way that factors in the important role of corporate compliance programs while providing whistleblowers a direct path to the S.E.C. in appropriate circumstances.”

The reference to a “direct path” for reporting violations certainly indicates that the S.E.C. is unlikely to mandate internal reporting of violations by corporate employees, which may have the effect of making compliance programs in this area almost superfluous.

Yet companies can hardly ignore the obligation to implement vigorous compliance procedures if they do business in Britain and want to remain in compliance with the internal control requirements imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

So while the Bribery Act strongly encourages companies doing business there to enhance their compliance procedures to lay the groundwork for a defense to any charge, the Dodd-Frank Act may lead employees to bypass those programs in order to report potential wrongdoing to the S.E.C. and reap a reward.

Corporations are used to being whipsawed in the market, where volatility in stock prices can become almost commonplace. It seems that the Bribery Act and Dodd-Frank Act are doing the same thing to corporate compliance programs by encouraging greater efforts to prevent bribery while allowing employees to transmit evidence directly to the S.E.C. without pausing to let the company know about the problems.
