THE raucous cheering from behind the ivy-covered wall had long since given way to polite applause, and this was the surest sign that Boris Becker was on his way out on Center Court. On Court 5, one long mis-hit away from tennis's most hallowed turf, Alexandra Stevenson was completing a Houdini-like performance that was Becker's trademark when he first won Wimbledon in 1985.

''Did Becker win?'' asked Stevenson, qualifier-turned-quarterfinalist, having barely survived a match point and outlasting Lisa Raymond in three sets. ''I hope he did.''

Becker was at that moment misplaying his last Wimbledon point, a backhand half-volley wide, and surrendering to Patrick Rafter in straight sets. With a shrug and a smile, the likable German said farewell to the court that 18-year-old Alexandra Stevenson has dreamed of playing on since she was the 9-year-old charge of Pete Fischer, Pete Sampras's former coach.

Discounting the proximity of Court 5 and that this is her first Wimbledon main draw, Stevenson said, ''I've never been close.'' She won't make Center Court today in her quarterfinal match against Jelena Dokic, but Stevenson can count on remaining in the middle of deepening intrigue. Her coming-out party as a tennis professional has turned, sadly, into an enervating inquiry on race and sex.
