The news that Jude Law is coming to “Hamlet” on Broadway this fall, and the buzz about Philip Seymour Hoffman and John Ortiz downtown in “Othello” in September, has obscured the recent chatter about another Shakespeare in town.

Will the critically praised Public Theater production of “Twelfth Night,” now in Central Park starring Anne Hathaway, Audra McDonald and Raúl Esparza, move to Broadway during the 2009-10 season?

Putting the question to Oskar Eustis, artistic director of the Public Theater, elicited this reply by email: “No plans for a future life now, but you never know.”

Some admirers of this Shakespeare in the Park production have urged such a transfer on theater blogs, but Ms. Hathaway and Ms. McDonald said in an interview last month that they had professional commitments through the fall. Julie White, who plays Maria, was also recently announced for the Roundabout Theater Company production this fall of Theresa Rebeck’s new play “The Understudy.”

And Broadway is mostly a destination for Shakespearean tragedies (“Macbeth,” “Julius Caesar”) though Lincoln Center Theater has done a range of plays at the Beaumont.

Still, fans of this production can understandably hope: Last summer’s show in the Park, “Hair,” closed in September and then transferred to Broadway this past March – and is now a major hit and the recipient of the 2009 Tony for best musical revival.
