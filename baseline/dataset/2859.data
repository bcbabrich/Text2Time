How we spend our money now is very different from the spending patterns back in 1949, the last time personal consumption expenditures accounted for as large a share of the economy as they do now.

The charts below show how much of each $1,000 in personal consumption spending goes for various things. In 1949, $700 went for the most basic of life's necessities: food, clothing and housing. Now the figure for those three categories is down to $458.

That decline has been a steady one, freeing up more money for a myriad of other things. The figure fell below $600 in 1971 and went under $500 in 1993. The last year the figure rose was 1974, when the economy was in the worst recession since the Great Depression. Since then there have been four recessions, but they have not been so severe that consumers cut back enough on other things to push up the proportion of consumer spending devoted to the three necessities.

Of those three, housing is the only one that has come close to maintaining its share of the American pocketbook. But that statistic is deceiving, because Americans expect a lot more now when buying houses, whether it is the number of bathrooms and bedrooms, or the things that are purchased to keep the household running. We get a lot more housing than we used to, even while spending about the same proportion of our available money.

The charts below are on widely varying scales; the objective is not to compare different categories of spending but to show how the share of consumer spending devoted to each category has grown bigger or smaller. A declining line may not mean less is being spent on an item; it could indicate that spending in that category is growing at a slower rate than overall spending is rising.
