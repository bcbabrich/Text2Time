Just when it seemed that metaphors comparing multifunction digital gadgets and the Swiss Army knife might have been waning, Victorinox, the venerable Swiss manufacturer, has upped the ante by actually adding a digital function to its famous knife.

The Swissmemory U.S.B. has the nail file, screwdriver and mini-scissors you would expect in a typical Swiss Army knife, but it also has a U.S.B. memory key that stores either 64 or 128 megabytes of data. The small device is compliant with the faster U.S.B. 2.0 standard and, like ordinary flash drives, has a red light-emitting diode to indicate read/write status.

The two versions of the Swissmemory knife, to be released in the United States this spring, are expected to sell for $73 and $88. More information is available at www.victorinox.com.

Oh, and for those who want to take their digital files past airport security, the U.S.B. plug is detachable, so the knife can be stowed in a checked bag. Andrew Zipern
