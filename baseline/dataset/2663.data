At the Calvary Chapel in Fort Lauderdale, an evangelical church with a racially diverse congregation, a guest speaker, Rick Green, a former Texas lawmaker who often talks to conservative groups, told 3,500 worshipers to "vote for righteousness." He directed people to "voter guides" in the hallway. One, published by the Christian Coalition, claimed that Mr. Kerry supported abortion and gay marriage. (Mr. Kerry has said he opposes same-sex marriage.) Books, including "America's Godly Heritage" and "Is America One Nation Under God?" were on sale. On her way out, Maureen Crocco, 58, said of Mr. Bush, "This is a man who lives out his faith, and I don't see anything wrong with that."

At the First Assembly of God Church, an evangelical congregation in Des Moines, the Rev. John M. Palmer told 800 worshipers: "I pray that God gives wisdom to every voter making choices, and that they will support individuals who uphold the sanctity of life. To choose individuals who are committed to biblical ways, and who will lead this nation with a biblical perspective."

A brochure in the program asked, "Why Must Christians Vote?" and quoted Scripture in answer: "When the godly are in authority, the people rejoice. But when the wicked are in power, they groan."

Kelli Russell, 17, said she was for Mr. Bush. "He believes what I believe and I support what he has done in office," she said.

In Denver, it was the Day of the Dead at the Cameron Church, a United Methodist congregation that honors loved ones and ancestors on the last Sunday of October, on or close to Halloween. The altar was crowded with mementos, and music to "wake the spirits" was played. Most of the worshipers, though not all, were Kerry supporters, and some wore buttons proclaiming their allegiance.

But the senior pastor, the Rev. Bill Kirton, was nonpartisan in his sermon, focusing on a scriptural beast in the Book of Daniel. "If you are a liberal you are a beast, and if you are a conservative you are a beast to somebody," he said. He advised looking past the election to what he called things that matter.

In Cleveland, the Rev. C. Jay Matthews, pastor of the Mount Sinai Baptist Church, a black congregation, recalled a personal political journey that had taken him from Mr. Bush to Mr. Kerry. "I have supported this president, and I've been a leader in promoting his faith-based initiatives," Mr. Matthews said. He even met with the Republican national chairman, Ed Gillespie, on how to raise black votes. But his congregation did not go along, and he had second thoughts as the campaign in Ohio became bitter with negative attacks.
