Jeffrey Vallance's second New York solo show is disappointing. The hilarious drawings and collages he showed here in 1999 revealed this veteran California subversive to be an expert and zany cartoonist, a funny and engaging writer and a perversely assiduous student of popular religions. This exhibition restricts the free play of his goofy enthusiasms.

The main event is a trio of life-size wax figures made by a professional fabricator, Victor Hugo. One is a satin-robed figure of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Another represents President Richard M. Nixon, whose image Mr. Vallance claims to have found miraculously reflected in the eyes of a Mexico City Virgin of Guadalupe. Mr. Vallance has also detected images of evil clowns in the markings on the Shroud of Turin; a collage in the show documents his being rebuked by the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights for publishing this discovery, the artist's respectful explanation of his motives and the league's retraction of its rebuke.

The third wax figure represents the poet Dante. A gallery release says he was included ''because of the immense influence the 'Inferno' has had on Vallance's life and work.'' Right.

All of this is amusing to think about, but it lacks the idiosyncratic energy of a drawing titled ''The Devil Hates Good Art,'' in which a portrait of Satan is surrounded by terms indicating artistic qualities he objects to, including talent and mastery, eccentricity, sincerity and uniqueness. Mr. Vallance is most engaging, after all, when he articulates his crazily convoluted ideas in quantity and by means of his own hand. KEN JOHNSON
