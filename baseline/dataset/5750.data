In this week's paychecks, New Yorkers will receive the first few dollars of the multiyear cut in state and city taxes enacted this year.

The maximum tax rate on earned income is being reduced to 9.5 percent from 10 percent, and lower withholding rates will take effect Monday. The lower withholding will also reflect an increase in the personal exemption to $850 from $800 and an increase in the standard deduction for single people to $2,500 and other taxpayers to $2,750. The standard deduction previously ranged from $1,500 to $2,500 for single taxpayers and from $2,000 to $2,500 for others.

Also taking effect this week is a family adjustment that allows couples to transfer up to $3,000 in income between spouses to lower their taxes.

These are some examples of the changes in withholding, according to the new state tax tables:

* A wage earner for a family of four earning $200 a week used to have $4.40 taken out of each paycheck for state taxes. Now, $2.70 will be taken out. A single taxpayer earning the same pay will have $5.20 withheld instead of $7.10.
