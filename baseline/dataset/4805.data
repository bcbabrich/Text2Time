The phenomenal success of Wal-Mart Stores can be traced in large part to the workrooms and factories of many of its suppliers, including the Liberty Trouser Company, a once-sleepy maker of work and hunting clothes.

Its marriage with Wal-Mart has given Liberty a hot new business in Liberty-brand children's wear for Wal-Mart, and that has led to the creation of a popular line of children's clothing called Circus Star for other retailers. Four Liberty sewing plants have been opened in northern Alabama in the last four years and Liberty's main offices here expanded recently into a new headquarters, a refurbished Pontiac dealership. If business continues to grow apace, Liberty may soon be bursting these walls, too.

For manufacturers like Liberty, Wal-Mart's fast-spreading network of nearly 1,800 discount stores in 36 states is a dream come true. Earlier this year Wal-Mart overtook Sears, Roebuck & Company as the nation's leading retailer. It is adding 150 stores annually and last year rang up $32.6 billion in sales.

Many suppliers and retailing experts think the close ties that Wal-Mart has with Liberty and its other suppliers is a reason the discounter has been able to continue its rapid growth, grabbing market share in a business that was considered mature years ago.
