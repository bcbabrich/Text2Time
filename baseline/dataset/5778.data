For his part, Mr. Brock has not responded publicly to reports of internal bickering over civil rights policy beyond insisting that his views are shared by President Reagan and other Administration officials. In any event, the growing brouhaha over affirmative action is not only an indication of how the issue of race still stirs strong emotions, but also a sign that Mr. Brock's honeymoon at the department may be over. ''The long knives are out for Brock,'' said a senior Labor Department official close to the Secretary, ''and there's going to be a continuing struggle as to what he can do here.''

It's all a far cry from the heady days just five months ago when Mr. Brock, a former Republican senator and onetime chairman of his party's national committee, answered President Reagan's appeal and left his position as United States Trade Representative to try to invigorate the demoralized agency. He succeeded Raymond J. Donovan, who resigned in March after a New York judge ordered him to stand trial on charges of fraud and larceny, and began a whirlwind of policy and personnel changes. Mr. Brock quietly removed several of Mr. Donovan's aides who had had sharp disputes with career employees. At the same time, he filled a number of key positions, some of which had been vacant for more than a year. The strategy, by most accounts, produced quick results. Morale improved, and he has reopened the department's doors to labor and civil rights groups by adopting what appears to be a more conciliatory attitude about their concerns.

Moving to soothe a particularly sore spot among critics of Mr. Donovan's tour in the department, Mr. Brock promised to review a decision by Robert A. Rowland, the former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, not to require farmers to provide toilets, drinking water and other sanitary facilities for half a million field hands throughout the country. He also told labor groups that the Administration's proposal for a youth subminimum wage scale was flawed, and, according to Labor Department officials, he intends to announce this fall major modifications in the bill.

Lynn R. Williams, the president of the United Steel Workers of America, said that so far, Mr. Brock's tenure is ''a great improvement over where we were before - Certainly, it's a much more open department.'' And A.F.L.-C.I.O. president Lane Kirkland, long a critic of the Administration's labor policies, said he was ''bemused'' by reports that Mr. Brock was being advised to take a tougher line with organized labor. ''There have always been elements of the Reagan Administration that have wanted to do away with the labor movement,'' Mr. Kirkland said.

But conservative groups, in particular, are increasingly unhappy about the Labor Department's new leadership, which they accuse of being far too interested in improving its image and appeasing critics. Reed Larson, head of the National Right to Work Committee, a conservative lobbying organization, accused Mr. Brock of ''turning his back on the rights of working people while catering to the institutional interests of politically powerful union officials.''
