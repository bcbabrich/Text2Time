SCRANTON, Pa., Dec, 2— Pennsylvania has broadened its program for insuring against loss to property on the surface that results from the collapse of old underground mines.

Amendments to the 1961 law setting up the insurance pro gram were signed by Gov. Mil ton J. Shapp at a ceremony this week at the Wilkes‐Barre Scranton Airport.

The insurance program, for merly self‐supporting and re stricted to private dwellings, will now be subsidized by the state and its coverage will in clude any type of “structure” instead of just “homes.”

Governor Shapp flew to the airport at nearby Avoca to sign the new amendments into law because most of the pressure for improving the insurance system came from legislators in the anthracite region embracing Scranton and Wilkes‐Barre.
