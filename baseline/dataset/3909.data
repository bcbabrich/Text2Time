MR. CLINTON pledged that the United States would cut emissions to 1990 levels in the next 10 to 15 years. The turnabout in emissions will be encouraged at first with tax incentives and research subsidies for conservation and clean energy production.

In later years, a cap will be placed on greenhouse emissions, coupled with a system to give credits for emissions reductions that companies can save and sell. It is a system in which the Government will set a mandatory goal but leave the mechanism to the market instead of turning to a Government fiat.

If the Administration's approach delivers the promised reductions, emissions between 2008 and 2012 will be about a third lower than current trends would predict.

But nobody knows how much that will cost. ''There is no credible, widely accepted economic analysis that currently exists in the United States, or in most other countries, that can answer very basic cost and benefit questions,'' said Eileen B. Claussen, a former senior aide to Mr. Wirth who had played an instrumental role in the talks but left the Administration a few months ago.

It wasn't for lack of trying. The Administration struggled for two years to come up with a credible analysis of the economic effects of moving away from fossil fuels, but the uncertainties -- over things like what the United States economy will look like a decade from now, what technological advances in emissions controls will be made and how willing consumers and manufacturers will be to respond to economic incentives -- proved overwhelming. Ms. Yellen essentially declared the effort to come up with reliable numbers a failure last summer.

That opened the door to something of a policy-making free-for-all that lasted well into the fall and has left many members of Congress wary, Ms. Claussen said.

There was never any serious debate inside the Administration about the science of the issue; the White House has decided that the climate problem is real and serious. After all, the leading environmentalist of them all is Mr. Gore, and he long ago won over President Clinton on the need to do something about the threat of climate change.
