Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who will not be voting in the Democratic presidential primary on Tuesday since he is a political independent, offered a little bit of political analysis on Friday morning about the significance of the Super Tuesday contests. In his weekly radio program on WABC-AM (770), the program’s host, John Gambling, asked the mayor, “Results from Tuesday, will they give you an opportunity to re-evaluate your personal situation?”

Mr. Bloomberg, unsurprisingly, offered his boilerplate denial of any interest in the presidency, but he also ventured some predictions:

Look, I’m not a candidate, but I think Tuesday you’ve got something like 22 states, including a lot of big ones, and it’s interesting, in the Republican Party, the Republican Party rules are winner-take-all. So you are much more likely in the Republican Party to come out with somebody that’s the prohibitive favorite after Tuesday than you are in the Democratic Party, where it’s proportional, the way they allocate delegates. And so one candidate could win a state, the other could come in second, but if their spreads are very different the results really are just tied in the number of delegates. And so for the Democrats there’s more of a chance, it seems to me, of the process going much later, even maybe all the way to the convention. And they’re going to have a problem of should they have seated Florida and all this sort of stuff. But both parties have wide-open races at the moment. There is more than one viable candidate in both parties, and that’s good for the country.

The mayor did not discuss the growing sentiment that he is not interested in seriously pursuing a White House run. On Thursday, The New York Observer’s Politicker blog quoted Karin Gallet, a founder of the Draft Bloomberg movement, as saying: “He’s not running. He’s convinced me. I’m returning to more obtainable goals like passing my business law class and supporting moderate Republicans!”
