Preliminary financing of $5.5 million for the office building that will rise on the site of the New Weston Hotel on Madison Avenue has been provided by the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company.

The hotel, occupying the east blockfront of the avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, will be torn down after the World's Fair closes and replaced by a 38‚Äêstory steel and glass office tower to be erected by the William Kaufman Organization from plans by Emery Roth & Sons, architects.

The Urban Servicing Company, mortgage correspondent for the John Hancock company, negotiated the loan, which contains options that will permit an increase to $8.5 million in the company's commitment at a later stage of the project.
