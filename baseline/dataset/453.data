Twice a year, the Crouches held “Praise-a-thons,” fund-raising drives in which they appealed for donations to keep programs like “Praise the Lord” on the air.

The Crouches were criticized for using those donations to finance a luxurious lifestyle, including the use of private jets. The family was reported to have multiple homes, among them his-and-hers mansions in Newport Beach, Calif.

In 2007, TBN purchased Holy Land Experience, a religious theme park in Orlando, Fla., for $37 million. Mrs. Crouch became Holy Land’s president and creative director and began a major remodeling of the park, renting adjacent rooms in a luxury hotel for nearly two years. One was used to house clothing and her two Maltese dogs, which otherwise occupied a motor home.

The family controversies made headlines in 2004, when The Los Angeles Times reported that Mr. Crouch had paid a former employee, Enoch Lonnie Ford, $425,000 in 1998 after Mr. Ford threatened to sue TBN for unjustly firing him. As part of the settlement, the newspaper said, Mr. Ford agreed not to publicize his claim that he had had a sexual encounter with Mr. Crouch. But Mr. Ford later threatened to publish a manuscript that discussed the matter.

Mr. Crouch denied Mr. Ford’s claims, and the case was settled by a private arbitrator.

In 2012, The Orange County Register reported that a granddaughter, Carra Crouch, had sued the network that year, alleging that she was raped by a TBN employee in 2006, when she was 13, and that the Crouch family had covered up the assault. The suit contended that when Carra Crouch told her grandmother about the assault, Mrs. Crouch “became furious” and screamed at her granddaughter, saying, “It is your fault.”

That suit has not yet been resolved, according to documents in Orange County Superior Court.

In another lawsuit filed around the same time, another granddaughter, Brittany Koper, who was TBN’s finance director, accused the network of misusing donated money. Ms. Koper and her husband, Michael, were fired and accused by the network of stealing $1.3 million.
