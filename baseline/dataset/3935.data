Almost every year when the tour returns to this misty, mystical place on the cliffs of the Monterey Peninsula, the moist air on the old golf course turns into an elixir. The Links at Pebble Beach become the cure for what ails middle-aged golfers, and players like Johnny Miller and Tom Watson and Peter Jacobsen and Jack Nicklaus somehow recapture the games of their youth and turn in performances sweeter than a ballad by Bing Crosby.

How else to explain Miller's victory two years ago, his first in seven years, at the age of 46? Or Jacobsen's triumph last year, his first in five years, a month shy of his 41st birthday? Watson finished second to Miller two years ago, and Nicklaus, at the age of 55 last year, managed a tie for sixth.

But this year, on the eve of the 56th playing of the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am (born the Crosby), there's something a little different in the air. Young men who have never seen a "Road" movie or heard a song by Bing are storming the place, armed with a whole lot of confidence and more collective game than any group of youngsters since the young lions of the 1970's.

They are led by Phil Mickelson, 25, who already has seven career victories, including triumphs in half the tournaments (two) played on the PGA Tour this season. Right there with him is Ernie Els, 26, winner of the South African Open two weeks ago. David Duval, 24, the runner-up here last year to Jacobsen, and Justin Leonard, 23, the runner-up to Mickelson last week at Phoenix. Throw in last year's rookie of the year, Woody Austin, and the promising nonwinner Steve Stricker, 29 next month, and that's a menacing young sixsome.
