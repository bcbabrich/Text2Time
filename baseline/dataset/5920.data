Representative Major R. Owens charged yesterday that the New York City Police Department used screening methods to eliminate minority applicants who had already passed the Civil Service examination to become police officers.

During an appearance on the WCBS-TV program ''Newsmakers,'' Mr. Owens, Democrat of Brooklyn, also blamed ''police incompetence'' for the attacks by youth bands on citizens following the Diana Ross concert in Central Park on July 22.

Police officials have acknowledged that they did not anticipate that roving bands would form. But Mr. Owens said, ''That should be a routine matter.''

As to the screening, Mr. Owens cited tooth and mouth examinations, as well as questions about the applicants' ''sex lives,'' as means by which the department winnowed the black and Hispanic applicants.
