AS a trial lawyer and formal Federal prosecutor, Raymond B. Grunewald has earned a reputation as a tough and savvy courtroom foe.

As the Democratic candidate for Nassau County Executive, Mr. Grunewald has borrowed some courtroom tactics - in desperation, some critics say - to make a withering cross-examination of the Republican incumbent, Thomas S. Gulotta, and the party's powerful Nassau organization.

''Gulotta is a total cipher who is governing this county by proclamation,'' said Mr. Grunewald, alluding to Mr. Gulotta's incessant public appearances, where he often presents county citations and awards.

''The Nassau Republican machine is an arrogant monopoly that no longer is working for the people,'' he said, citing the garbage, traffic and ground-water problems facing the county.
