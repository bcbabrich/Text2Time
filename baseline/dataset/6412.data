Former Detective Michael Martin, who retired from the Police Department last month before the completion of his departmental trial on charges of stealing and selling confi dential police information, ap peared in Criminal Court yes terday to face prosecution for the same alleged offense.

He was arraigned, released inl custody of the Manhattan Dis trict Attorney's office for fingerprinting and told to re turn to Night Court, where bail was set at $5,000.

It was the second time Mr. Martin had been arraigned, previous hearing having been disputed as invalid by his lawyers.

His appearance yesterday was viewed by the District At torney's office as something of a victory. The day after the detective's departmental trial, had ended inconclusively, Chief’ Assistant District Attorney Al fred J. Scotti accused the Police Department of letting Mr. Martin “slip through their hands.”
