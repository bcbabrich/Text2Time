BERLIN, July 31 â€” Premier Khrushchev may be ready to offer a slight modification of the Soviet stand on Berlin as a goodwill gesture to pave the way for a meeting with Chancellor Ludwig Erhard of West Germany, informed sources said today.

The move would involve acceptance by the Soviet Union of the inclusion of West Berlin in a new trade agreement between West Germany and the Soviet Union. This would amount to a tacit recognition of Bonn's formal economic ties with West Berlin.

The sources recalled, however, that the Soviet leader was reported to have reassured Welter Ulbricht, Communist chief of East Germany, in Warsaw last week that the Soviet Union did not contemplate any other changes on Germany and the country's reunification.

Above all, Mr. Khrushchev was said to have stressed his determination to maintain the Russian stand of two separate Germanys that must come to terms with each other in direct negotiations. The West has repeatedly rejected such suggestions as unworkable.
