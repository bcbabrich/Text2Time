Gary Moy and two friends went to the Le Q pool hall in lower Manhattan Friday night to play "Street Fighter," a video game that simulates violence among city youths. He got a taste of the real thing when three men wearing black ski masks stepped through the doors about 11:30, approached one of the pool tables and opened fire.

"People started screaming," Mr. Moy, 21 years old, said yesterday as he lay in a Beth Israel Hospital bed. "I heard 'bang!' And people got down." Mr. Moy also dropped to the floor, anxiously examining himself to see if he had been shot. "I saw a hole in my pants," he said. "And it hurt."

James Rou, 17, of 83-30 Vietor Avenue in Queens, was shot dead in the hail of 15 to 20 bullets. Mr. Moy, who lives in Manhattan and works as a legal clerk, was hit in the left thigh, and one of his friends, Sum Chi Lee, 22, was shot in the right leg and right lower back. A fourth person, Vincent Del Bagno, 17, was shot in the back, and Marcus Huang, also 17, was shot in the shoulder and knee.

The police yesterday played down initial reports that the attack was gang-related, although they did not rule that possibility out.
