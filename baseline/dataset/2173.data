New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, in presenting the city’s budget, counseled austerity becuse he sees the real estate market slowing and prices dropping. That would mean less tax revenue.

“The city’s commercial occupancy rate is the highest in the nation. New York’s real estate market is expected to slow, however, with a 10% decline in home prices, a 14% decline in home sales over the next few years and a significant decline in real estate transaction taxes that have buoyed the City’s tax revenue in the last few fiscal years.”

It’s a healthy warning to other localities that are awash in tax money thanks to the housing boom. It isn’t going to last. — DAMON DARLIN
