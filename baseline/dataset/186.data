It’s always sweater weather for Samuel Barsky.

Oh look! There he is standing in front of the skating rink at Rockefeller Center wearing a sweater adorned with ice skaters. That’s him too at the Luxor hotel in Las Vegas with a pyramid on his chest. And last summer he posted a photograph on Instagram in front of Niagara Falls with a sweater depicting (what else?) the famous waterfalls.

Coincidence? No.

For nearly 20 years Mr. Barsky, 43, has been knitting sweaters of familiar landscapes and, in recent years, posting photographs of himself posing in front of them, wearing his matching jumper.

So far, he has created 119 sweaters in all — including scenes of the Golden Gate Bridge, the Twin Towers, Stonehenge and Jerusalem’s Western Wall — which he has chronicled by year on his website.
