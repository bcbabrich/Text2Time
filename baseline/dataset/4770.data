Credit-card issuers are resorting to such incentives because they have cards in the hands of nearly everyone who qualifies for one. Up to 90 percent of the eligible households have an American Express, Visa, Mastercard or Discover card, analysts say. More than 111 million people have one or more credit cards.

So now the card issuers want to get consumers to use their cards more frequently and charge larger amounts when they do. Card companies have been exploring many new outlets for card use, like movie theaters, fast-food restaurants and supermarkets.

Last year, American consumers charged nearly $350 billion of goods and services on cards.

The last big innovation in the credit-card business was instituted in 1987 by American Express and quickly copied by Visa and Mastercard. Their programs provided expanded warranties for items bought with a credit card in the case of breakage, loss, theft or fire damage. Not an Entirely New Idea

The idea for Citibank's price-protection plan is not entirely new. Analysts say an Arizona bank, the Valley National Bank of Phoenix, pioneered the idea with its credit cards. Also, Diner's Club, another Citicorp unit, has a similar service, except that it charges an additional $49 fee and the service applies only to specific stores.

Citibank would not disclose how much it expected to spend on the price-protection program. Industry analysts say the cost could be relatively little, if credit-card issuers' experience with warranties is any guide -- very few cardholders have filed claims under the warranty program.

H. Spencer Nilson, publisher of The Nilson Report, an industry newsletter, estimates that substantially fewer than 1 percent of card holders file claims under programs like buyer protection. In addition, people who buy larger-ticket items like furniture and stereo equipment are likely to comparison-shop anyway and get the lowest price. Whatever the minimal cost of the program, it is likely to be offset by more purchases on credit cards.

"It is a very crowded market," Mr. Nilson said. "The first one in the market with an incentive like this gets the advantage. Everyone else is a me-too." Important Merchant Fees
