The owner of the New England Patriots' football team yesterday promised ''mammoth changes'' for the team's management structure while angrily complaining he had not been informed by Patriot officials for several days about an incident in which Lisa Olson, a sports reporter for The Boston Herald, alleged she was subjected to sexual harassment by several naked players in the New England locker room on Sept. 17.

Victor Kiam, appearing on National Football League pregame programs on NBC and CBS, said: ''The fact that no action was taken from Monday until Thursday is a disgrace and the fact that I was not even told by my own people is worse than that.''

Asked about the future status of Patrick Sullivan, the New England general manager, Kiam said, ''I think there will be changes in the ultimate responsibility at the Patriots.'' But, shortly afterward, he was told by Paul Tagliabue, the N.F.L. commissioner, that he could not make any personnel changes or suspend anyone until the league office completes its investigation.

According to Olson, who with Bob Sales, the Herald's executive sports editor, met with Kiam for 1 hour 15 minutes yesterday morning at a Logan Airport hotel, the owner is also angry with Jim Oldham, the Patriots' director of media relations, for not keeping him informed of the controversy.
