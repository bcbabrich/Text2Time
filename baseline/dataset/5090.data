In an effort to reduce a growing tide of plastic waste it must either burn or bury, the Minneapolis City Council adopted an ordinance today to ban most throwaway plastic food packaging from grocery store shelves and fast-food outlets.

The legislation, which does not take effect until July 1990, would permit the use of items like plastic milk jugs and soft-drink bottles only if the city can work out an acceptable recycling program for plastics.

The Minneapolis ordinance and a nearly identical piece of legislation pending before the St. Paul City Council are the most far-reaching efforts yet by local governments to restrict the growing volume of plastic waste making its way into the nation's municipal landfills and incinerators.

In general, the ordinance would prohibit any kind of packaging that is not environmentally acceptable; that is, packaging that is not naturally degradable, like paper; returnable for reuse, like some glass containers; or acceptable for recycling, like metal cans. Long Island Ordinance
