While her husband, William C. Ford Jr., is starring in his second round of commercials for the Ford Motor Company, Lisa V. Ford has her own ads running on Detroit's airwaves.

But while her husband extols Ford's lineup of vehicles, Mrs. Ford's radio spots promote a benefit concert for the Children's Center of Wayne County. The concert, set for Thursday night, will feature Gladys Knight and will be the first entertainment event at Ford Field, the new downtown arena for the Detroit Lions, the football team owned by the Ford family.

Mrs. Ford doesn't mention her husband in the spots, identifying herself only as Lisa Ford. She could not be reached for comment. Mrs. Ford has pretty much kept a low profile since Mr. Ford became chief executive -- at least until now. Micheline Maynard
