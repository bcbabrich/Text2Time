Two of the largest retailers have gone to court to block one of the hottest products of the largest credit card company, Visa U.S.A. Inc.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Limited Inc. filed an antitrust suit against Visa, arguing that they should not be forced to accept Visa Check cards -- debit cards with the Visa logo that withdraw purchases from the cardholders checking account. Visa insists that retailers that accept its credit cards must also accept the check cards.

The suit, filed last Friday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, contends that the merchants must pay a fee for check card transactions that is almost as high as the fee on credit card transactions -- typically between 1.5 percent and 3 percent of the purchase price.

The two chains contend that the debit cards can be used as if they were credit cards or cash cards of the type used in automated teller machines. But if they are used as cash cards, the fees paid by merchants should be 10 cents a transaction, the suit says.
