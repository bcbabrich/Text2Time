When Washington hosted the New Orleans Hornets on Saturday night, John Wall started for the Wizards.

That would not seem surprising for a player chosen No. 1 over all in 2010, but for Wall it is only the second time he was healthy enough to play five consecutive games.

The talent that Wall showed at Kentucky has been on display in the moments he has managed to be on the court, with averages of 15.9 points, 8.4 assists and 2.0 steals.

But he started fewer than half of the Wizardsâ€™ 32 games because of ailments including a bruised thigh and a bone bruise behind his kneecap.

Washington, among the worst teams in the N.B.A. at 8-23 entering Saturday, might benefit if Wall were able to play more often, especially with his backcourt colleague Kirk Hinrich having missed time with a bruised thigh.
