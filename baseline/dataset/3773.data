New Jersey families who need help paying their winter heating bills will receive a total of $7.1 million in emergency Federal money, in addition to the $37.8 million that has already been allocated, the White House announced yesterday.

Last year, poor New Jersey families received an average of about $214, said John McKeegan, a spokesman for the State Department of Human Services. To qualify for the program, a family of three must make no more than $19,476 a year, he said.
