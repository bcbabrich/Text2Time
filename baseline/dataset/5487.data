The situation seems to call for a tough quarterback, and Crocicchia has credentials. He said his nose and his right little finger had been broken while boxing. Amateur boxing? ''No,'' he said. College boxing? ''No,'' he said, ''bar boxing. I took a couple of hits, but I can take care of myself. But don't make me out to be a fighter. My mother will kill me.''

Before the strike, Crocicchia put off job hunting and attempted to keep in shape by running, playing tennis and trying to find pass receivers. He got some of his high school teammates to join him after they finished work and threw passes to them.

''It's all coming back,'' he said. ''I feel a little ahead of the game. Some guys' heads are spinning a bit. I have a grasp. But I need fine-tuning.''

Busch was back at South Dakota State, taking the 14 credits he needed for his degree, helping coach the varsity quarterbacks and wide receivers as a $500-a-season graduate assistant. He was also bagging groceries at the Hy-Vee supermarket in Brookings, S.D., for $4 an hour.

Now he must take incompletes in his seven courses, and when the strike is over he will look for a new job to earn expenses. He said it was all worth it, and he cited a comment by Coach Mike Ditka of the Chicago Bears.

''He said that all of us are going to be on N.F.L. rosters,'' said Busch. ''He said that's one thing they can't take away from you.'' ROSTER AT 52

The Giants' roster remained at 52. Because the Giants play Monday night, they have until 4 P.M. Monday to reduce the active roster to 45. They may also declare up to 10 players inactive for that game, making them more or less a taxi squad. . . . The striking Giants called off their Wednesday-morning practice in Washington Township, N.J., because of rain. Gary Reasons lives near the field there, and the 18 players who turned up drove to his home. He briefed them on Wednesday's meeting held by Gene Upshaw, the executive director of the Players Association, with player representatives and other players.
