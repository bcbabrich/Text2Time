Then a miracle happened. An affordable electronic picture box was invented that brought shadowy black-and-white images into people's living rooms. Along with the stars came more and more people who looked and acted just like everybody else, except they were a little more polished. Year by year, the box grew larger, the images clearer, and -- presto! -- they appeared in color, and in stereo.

It became harder and harder to tell the difference between the stars and everybody else. And when the box grew so big that a close-up of a face was larger than life, another magical thing happened. Every face that appeared on the box became a star face. If you subscribed to cable, you could tune in to any of 50 to 100 separate little worlds, each peopled with its own star galaxy, all of them in your box at exactly the same instant. Suddenly television wasn't just three networks and a couple of local stations; it was the whole endlessly expanding universe.

The elevation of everybody whose face was shown on the box evolved naturally from Andy Warhol, who in the 60's was one of the first people on the planet to develop his own stable of "superstars," garden-variety narcissists who just had to be in the movies because they knew they were special.

By 1970, this celestial democracy was proclaimed in popular songs like John Lennon's "Instant Karma" and Sly and the Family Stone's "Everybody Is a Star." That phrase -- "everybody is a star" -- is so optimistically American. Democratic and egalitarian, it implies that millions of people have enough vision and autonomy to see themselves as larger-than-life beings with unlimited opportunities. Nobody's better than anyone else. I'm O.K.; you're O.K.

But if everybody is a star, who's going to watch? That is the humorous question posed in "To Die For." The obvious answer is that some stars will be brighter than others. For the contradictory nature of television is that while it is busy including everybody and finding the lowest common denominator of taste, it is also about winning. If a television show doesn't grab ratings, it's kaput. That's where the monster comes in.

A media monster is born out of the increasingly hard-to-discern gulf between our day-to-day reality and television's version of life. With its orderly montage and authoritative tone, television presents itself as an objective mirror of the world. The larger it grows, the more convincingly objective it appears.
