TAMPA, Fla., Jan. 1 — Joe Paterno stepped gingerly onto the sideline at Raymond James Stadium this morning, his cane firmly in hand as a Penn State staffer, security and cameras hovered. It was a significant milestone in Paterno’s recovery from a broken left leg and torn ligaments on Nov. 4, when he was run over on the sideline by two players during a game at Wisconsin. Finally, Paterno was back on the field.

He did not stay very long. Paterno, who turned 80 on Dec. 21, stood for eight minutes before slowly making his way back to the tunnel during pregame warmups and then up to the press box. He was still too fragile and immobile to risk another hit coaching the Nittany Lions against Tennessee in the Outback Bowl.

Instead, Paterno watched from above along with 65,601 fans as a defensive battle turned on an 88-yard fumble return by Penn State cornerback Tony Davis with 10 minutes 1 second remaining to lift the Nittany Lions to a 20-10 victory against No. 17 Tennessee. It as the 22nd bowl victory of Paterno’s career, and his team finished the season 9-4.

The fumble return happened one play after a 53-yard pass from Tennessee quarterback Erik Ainge, nephew of the Boston Celtics executive Danny Ainge, to tight end Chris Brown gave the Volunteers (9-4) a first down on the Penn State 14-yard line — Tennessee’s best scoring opportunity of a lean second half.

The Vols appeared on their way to breaking a 10-10 tie. But linebacker Sean Lee punched the ball out of running back Arian Foster’s arms on the next play, and Davis picked up the ball and sprinted down the sideline for the touchdown that put Penn State in control.
