From all appearances, Or seems to have long ago assumed the role of the responsible one in the family: she collects bottles and cans for money, works as a dishwasher in a restaurant owned by a sympathetic neighbor and keeps up the family's cramped, cluttered apartment as best she can. In turn, Ruthie, recently returned from a hospital stay, behaves like one of those out-of-control adolescents who show up on cable television: she dresses like Slattern Barbie, refuses to get up in the morning, sneaks out at night, keeps bad company and whines, a lot.

Shot in an unadorned style that makes everything look fairly grotty, the women included, the film mixes scenes of quotidian life with melodramatic incident, and then the whole thing grinds to a stop. Along the way, Ms. Yedaya and her co-writer, Sari Ezouz, build the case that prostitutes are purely victims and that prostitution is so pathological, so radically dehumanizing, that the prostitute herself is little more than an empty shell.

In this formulation, prostitution isn't a lousy way to make a living; it's an iron cage with a rusted lock. Ruthie and Or are victims not only of poverty, male opportunism and social indifference, but also of their actions and desires, which don't really belong to them in any meaningful sense because, well, everything they do and feel is symptomatic of their pathological existence.

Ms. Yedaya's take on prostitution would be tolerable if her characters, especially Ruthie, weren't such ideological constructs. A monster from her gaudy blue eye-shadow to her Frankenstein platforms, Ruthie insists on breaking her daughter's heart by turning tricks. She says they need the money, but something else clearly drives her into the streets. But because Ms. Yedaya refuses to give Ruthie a hint of a dreamscape, a moment outside that iron cage, we never learn what makes her tick.

That Ruthie might get something she needs from prostitution, however unhealthy, is something the film refuses to consider; worse, there's a suggestion that Or's teenage lust is a symptom of Ruthie's pathology rather than something good and real and human. Prostitution isn't the only disease in this film; so is desire.
