Hopes for an early clear trend in South Africa's first fully democratic elections receded in confusion and a maze of problems, as the nation's 20 million voters waited expectantly for the votes to be counted.

The results, which will take days to tally, are expected to result in the election of Nelson Mandela, the longtime political prisoner of the white apartheid regime, as the nation's first black president.

After the first 12 hours of tallying, an inconclusive fragment of less than 1 percent of the total vote was announced.

But party workers asserted that early unreleased figures bore out expectations that Mr. Mandela's African National Congress would take the national lead, followed by the National Party of the outgoing President, F. W. de Klerk, who is expected to be the Chief Deputy President under the new Constitution.
