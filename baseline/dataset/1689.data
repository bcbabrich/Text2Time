Audiences on the West Coast will soon be able to have their senses overstimulated by the Wooster Group’s trippy production of “La Didone.” The New York-based theater troupe will begin a partnership with REDCAT, the Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater in Los Angeles, the Wooster Group said on Friday. Cynthia Hedstrom, the troupe’s producer, said in an interview that the collaboration would bring several Wooster Group productions to REDCAT for residencies of one to two weeks over the next three to five years. The partnership was reported on the Web site of The Los Angeles Times. Ms. Hedstrom said that “La Didone,” the Wooster Group’s cross-pollination of a 1641 opera and a 1965 horror film, “Planet of the Vampires,” would play at REDCAT from June 11 through 21, and that a production of Tennessee Williams’s “Vieux Carré” is scheduled there for February.
