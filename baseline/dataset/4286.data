It may be as late as game time tomorrow night against the Devils before we find out the fate of the Rangers. Unless the National Hockey League's Owners' Assembly votes to allow the Rangers to trade Adam Graves and Brian Leetch for Wayne Gretzky, we might as well kiss the Cup goodbye.

Call this the longest day. One can only imagine the promises and payoffs flying around like loose pucks. On one side is the so-called Ice-Agers, the traditional old guard of Canadian-oriented owners, led by Toronto and Montreal, who believe that a championship in New York will anchor the league against the rising tide of parvenu glitz-kriegers who want to turn it into a white N.B.A.

On the other side is the so-called Seven Dwarfs, the progressive new franchises who want to make the N.H.L. a truly modern major league. The Dwarfs are led by the Disney Mighty Ducks and the Blockbuster Panthers. They are politicking for the votes of the so-called Snowblowers, who have so far stayed out of the fray -- like hockey players who spray ice when they brake sharply at the first sign of trouble.

To permit this extraordinary trade after the league's regular deadline requires a two-thirds vote by the Assembly, a semisecret group that meets only in special session and then only on issues that affect the survival of the sport.
