Mr. Dillon, who has been interviewed by investigators, has said that he had weekly breakfasts on the day before the magazine was to be released with employees from the Donnelley plant in Old Saybrook, Conn., investigators said.

In addition, Mr. Dillon has told investigators that similar trades based on the Business Week articles were made through accounts held in the name of Mr. Dillon's mother, Elizabeth Baird, and one of his friends, Francis Roche. It is not clear whether his mother and Mr. Roche made the trades themselves.

The account in Ms. Baird's name was maintained through the retail brokerage Quick & Reilly Group, the investigators said. The account in Mr. Roche's name was kept at the Charles Schwab Corporation. Both accounts were maintained through branches in Connecticut.

There was no answer at the telephone in Mr. Roche's home. Ms. Baird did not return a message left with a woman who answered her home telephone. Mr. Dillon did not return a phone message left on his answering machine at home. California Plant Involved

The second Donnelley plant, based in Ventura, Calif., became part of the investigation as a result of trades made through the Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. branch in nearby Anaheim.

Officials from Prudential said that one Donnelley employee at the plant apparently traded on information from Business Week articles through an account at the Anaheim branch. The brokerage on Friday dismissed Brian Callahan, the broker who oversaw the account, after the account was suspended.

Also under investigation by the S.E.C. are a second stockbroker at Merrill's New London branch, a stockbroker at Advest Inc. in New London and three former brokers from the Hartford office of E.F. Hutton & Company.

Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., the firm that absorbed Hutton last year, has had some difficulty in its investigation of the case, one Shearson official said yesterday. The Hutton office where the three brokers worked has been closed, and all branch records were in the process of being transferred when the investigation broke, this official said.
