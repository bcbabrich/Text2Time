A new study has bolstered the belief that past head injuries may be related to Alzheimer's disease, scientists said yesterday.

The study, conducted at the University of Washington in Seattle, compared the head trauma history of 130 patients who had Alzheimer's disease with a comparison group of the same number of people in which there had been no clinical diagnosis of the disease. The researchers found that Alzheimer patients were three and a half times as likely to have suffered head injuries.

The relationship of injury to Alzheimer's held true even when the injury occurred decades before the onset of the debilitating, mind-destroying disease, according to the report in the March issue of The American Journal of Epidemiology.

The reason was unclear but the researchers speculated that it might relate to brain cell damage or to injury to the blood-brain barrier, which prevents almost all substances in the blood from entering brain tissue.
