Will it be Simms or Hostetler?

That was the question that broke the silence, broke the ice and ever so slightly broke up Bruce Coslet at training camp today. With the first exhibition game against Philadelphia just three days away, the Jets' head coach has other things on his mind than answering the quarterback question of the Super Bowl champion Giants. He even has a sizable quarterback quandary of his own.

"I hope to play all the quarterbacks," said Coslet, who has already indicated that last year's starter, Ken O'Brien, will get the start against the Eagles.

"If that works out, fine," said Coslet. "If not, don't read too much into it, because we're going to try to win the game. Our first priority always is to win the game. We want to see some young defensive players. We saw them in a scrimmage situation. Now we want to see them in a game."

The Jets lost a controlled scrimmage to the Washington Redskins, 25-16, last Saturday at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., as Coslet got a good look at his quarterbacks in 7-on-7 passing drills against no rush and 11-on-11 against a weak pass rush.
