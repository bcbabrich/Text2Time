Both the original London production at the National Theater and the Off Broadway run at the Park Avenue Armory were New York Times Critic’s Picks.

“The Lehman Trilogy” has lined up an award-winning creative team, including the director Sam Mendes, who won a Tony Award this year for his direction of “The Ferryman,” and the costume designer Katrina Lindsay, who has won two Tony Awards.

Producing the show are the National Theater, behind several recent Broadway hits including “Network” and “Angels in America,” and Mr. Mendes’s Neal Street Productions, whose “The Ferryman” won this year’s Tony Award for best play. Scott Rudin, Barry Diller and David Geffen will also produce.

The Nederlander was previously home to “Pretty Woman,” which closed in August. Harry Connick Jr. will begin performances of his ode to Cole Porter in December at the theater before embarking on a national tour.
