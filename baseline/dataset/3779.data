The competitive revolution in telecommunication took two encouraging steps forward this week. News Corporation announced a merger that promises to provide its customers with a broadcast satellite service fully equal, if not superior, to their local cable service. AT&T, the long-distance carrier, then announced that it had secretly developed a technology that would allow it to bring local phone service to people's homes without using the equipment of the regional Bell companies.

The key in both cases is wireless communication. News Corporation, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, and AT&T are threatening to break the monopoly choke hold of their competitors by sending their services over the air, rather than laying fabulously expensive wires into everyone's home.

News Corporation will invest $1 billion in a new service with Echostar Communications, a small satellite broadcaster. The combined facilities will offer homes across most of the country a video service that includes hundreds of channels of high-resolution TV, C.D.-quality sound and something that no other satellite service has so far been able to provide -- signals from at least some local television stations. Because satellite services have lacked local channels, they have lured too few cable customers to keep cable rates down. By offering satellite customers local channels, News Corporation will give households the option of saying goodbye to their local cable monopolies.

AT&T also plans to bring its service into the home over the air rather than through a wire. The wireless technology will broadcast phone calls from towers directly to a radio box attached to the home. From there, the call will travel through phone lines and equipment that already exist in everyone's home.
