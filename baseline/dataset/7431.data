TO THE EDITOR:

Let me second Kidder Smith's suggestion in his letter published April 23. It will come hard to architects to forgo the use of redwood—a perfectly beautiful building material, and one which the West Coast architects have used to create an imaginative and delightful new style of domestic architecture. But the style is established now; let them use their fertile imaginations to adapt a less precious material to its needs.

Worst of all is the intent of the California State Highway Department to cut an expressway through a redwood forest which was purchased by private contributions and given to the state as a memorial dedicated to the war dead. The serious crime against conservation of a resource of great beauty is compounded by desecration and the breaking of a sacred trust.

To refer back again to the original Times editorial [April 5]: “Time is rapidly running out.”
