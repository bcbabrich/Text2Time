BANGKOK, Thailand, May 1 (AP)—The head of the Vietnamese delegation that is to open talks with the United States in Paris this week said that America must in Paris this week said that Washington must give up its “erroneous policy” toward Vietnam before relations can be established, the Vietnam press agency reported today.

In a broadcast monitored here, the agency quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Pham Hien as saying in a statement issued in Paris that he would conduct the talks “with an attitude of good faith,” but he declined to predict their outcome.

Mr. Hien, who arrived in Paris Friday, said that Vietnam was looking to the future in its dealings with the United States. “But the past and the future cannot be separated,” he said. “That's why one must settle satisfactorily the problems left by the past.”

The Vietnamese have insisted the United States provide the economic aid promised in the Paris peace agreement of 1973, while the United States has demanded a full accounting of its troops missing in action during the Indochina war as a condition for diplomatic recognition.
