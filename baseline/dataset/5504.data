Soon the Hawks, now calling themselves the Band, were at work on an album of their own, ''Music From Big Pink.'' That album and its followup, ''The Band,'' introduced Robbie Robertson's songwriting, which combined a cinematic approach to imagery with a rare insight into American history and myth. Some of his songs were portraits of ordinary Americans caught up in changes they could only begin to understand, like the Southerners facing the defeat of the Confederacy in ''The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.'' Other songs told tall tales in backwoods vernacular; some were stark stories of guilt and redemption with a vivid frontier ambiance. But as career pressures mounted, the Band's records began to seem more calculated, and by the mid-70's, the Band's stage shows were beginning to seem cut and dried. Mr. Robertson decided it was time to go out with a bang. The result was ''The Last Waltz,'' the concert in San Francisco that reunited the band with Bob Dylan and other musical associates and became one of the finest rock concert films, lovingly directed by Martin Scorsese.

The major influence on Mr. Robertson's re-emergence has been his rediscovery of his own American Indian roots. The album begins with deep, reverberating tom-toms, and several of the songs address Indian-related themes.

''My mother was a Mohawk, born and raised on a reservation,'' Mr. Robertson noted, ''and when I was a kid, she would take me there to visit her relatives. I used to get this indescribable feeling from those visits, and now I feel like it's time for me to deal with that American Indian element.''

''Robbie Robertson'' is an eclectic and sometimes startling record. The drums one hears at the beginning are filtered through atmospheric keyboard textures that sound distinctly like Peter Gabriel's work, and in fact, Mr. Gabriel and his band do appear on several tracks. By working with artists as identifiable as Mr. Gabriel and U2, Mr. Robertson risks subsuming his own identity. But as the album progresses, he cannily combines these familiar pop sounds with song forms, vocal inflections, and guitar sounds rooted in his earlier work. The soaring, lyrical ''Showdown at Big Sky,'' for example, is strongly reminiscent of the Band's best years. And the two songs Mr. Robertson recorded with U2 in Ireland don't sound like U2 or the Band; they have a musical identity, and an excitement, all their own.

The lyrics are intensely personal throughout, whether Mr. Robertson is writing about his experiences as a teen-age rocker exploring the American South (''Somewhere Down the Crazy River'') or coming to terms with his American Indian heritage. Sometimes the writing seems wordy, overwrought, but this effect only underscores the album's evident sincerity. After keeping these songs and feelings bottled up for a decade, Mr. Robertson seems to be letting them out all at once, and the song formats he has come up with, ingenious as they are at times, can scarcely hold back the flood.
