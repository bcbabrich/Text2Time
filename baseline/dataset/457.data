THURSDAY PUZZLE — Just yesterday we were discussing how you can’t always expect to find a crossword theme in the long Across entries, and today we have another example of just that. Susan Gelfand is back with a theme that will jump right out at you, if you know where to look.

Today’s Theme

I’m not sure how many kids think of a JACK IN THE BOX as a fun toy (personally, I found them terrifying), but we have four symmetrical JACKs in BOXes today. The JACK part of the entry is a rebus, so you would write or type JACK all in one square. If you’re solving in our iOS app, here’s how you enter more than one letter in a square:

The trick is knowing where to put those rebuses.

We have [JACK]ASS crossing [JACK] FROST, [JACK] POTS crossing [JACK] CHEESE, FLAP [JACK] crossing LUMBER [JACK] (clued brilliantly as “Strong feller?”, as in feller of trees) and CAR [JACK] crossing PHONE [JACK].

The revealer, JACK IN THE BOX, is split today between 8D and 48D.

In nontheme news, I enjoyed RAVE MUSIC, SEA TURTLE, LEONINE, NUTELLA (because yum), MAHALIA Jackson and Eve ENSLER, author of “The Vagina Monologues.”

Tricky Clues

– From the Department of Now You Know: A BRAINO consists of “words or parts of words being missed out or swapped around when somebody is speaking, often completely altering the meaning of what the person said. When it occurs, the culprit normally doesn’t notice they did it until a few seconds later, and often not until it is too late.” An example would be “I’m feeling fine and walking the dog” becoming “I’m walking fine and feeling the dog.”{Urban Dictionary}

– When you see the phrase “First name in …” outside of crosswords, you’re normally thinking of the most important person in a given genre. In this puzzle, however, you’re being asked to literally enter a first name in gospel, and that would be MAHALIA (Jackson).

– At 68A, “Jabber?” appears to be asking about the act of talking too much. Today, however, the clue refers to something you can jab someone with, like an ÉPÉE.

– Clue of the Day for me was “Strong feller?” at 44D. A LUMBERJACK certainly could be a strong feller (for “fellow”), but you need to be a strong feller of trees to be a LUMBERJACK.

Have you ever seen a SEA TURTLE and 70-80 of its nearest and dearest hatch and head for the ocean? I find this mesmerizing:
