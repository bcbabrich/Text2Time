It's gotten so that Bill Wennington can't find a game anywhere. Wennington, the 7-foot center who helped take St. John's to the Final Four last season, returned to Alumni Hall the other day for his first visit since being drafted by the Dallas Mavericks last spring.

But if a good workout was in his plans, it was not in Lou Carnesecca's.

''We had four days off, so I decided to come back and visit my family, see some friends and work out,'' said Wennington, who also played high school ball in the area, at Long Island Lutheran. ''It's always been cozy here.''

Having put in very little playing time with Dallas, Wennington hoped to get a good workout with his former teammates. But during his one game against Ron Stewart, Brian Mahoney, the Redmen's assistant coach, shooed him to the other end of the court so that the St. John's players could begin their drills. Later he ran through some drills with the team, and even went head to head against Marco Baldi and Terry Bross. ''But every time I went to shoot or drive, Coach would yell, 'Don't hurt him, don't hurt him,' '' Wennington said with a chuckle. When Carnesecca's fears of injury to his former center led him to keep Wennington out of the full-court scrimmage, Wennington ambled offcourt, and one of the team managers called after him: ''Coming back tomorrow? We practice at 10.''

''So does Long Island Lutheran,'' Wennington answered. ''Why're you going out there?'' the manager asked.
