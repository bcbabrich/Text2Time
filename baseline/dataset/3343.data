There was clearly plenty of bad news from the August sales numbers. The biggest stunner came Wednesday night from the normally efficient Gap Inc., which announced that its same-store sales would be down 14 percent for the month. And Wall Street analysts began lowering their earnings forecasts for major players as they missed sales growth estimates. For example, Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, lowered his third-quarter earnings estimates for Dillard's, May Department Stores, J. C. Penney and even the previously invincible Target.

But as disappointing as sales at those chains were, there were still some bright spots. The merchants that did best were mostly those that sold goods besides clothing. Sears, Roebuck & Company, for example, had a strong sales increase of 5.6 percent, largely on the strength of its home appliance and gardening businesses.

It is also true that in a fiercely competitive environment, the strong continue to grow stronger. Wal-Mart Stores and Costco both continued to rack up gains at juggernaut paces in August. On the apparel side, Kohl's posted a 9.1 percent gain, and sales at the luxury retailer Neiman Marcus increased 8.1 percent.

Beyond the bright spots, the economic picture was mixed enough that economists, analysts and retailers were split about how dire the forecast would be for the months ahead. The economy is certainly losing some of its heat after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates six times since June 1999. Higher gas and oil prices have also taken a toll. And after frenzied spending last year, consumers may be taking a breather, as Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, predicted they would in July.

Unemployment, however, is low; wages are relatively high, and consumer confidence remains near all-time highs, according to the University of Michigan survey of consumers. Moreover, the Commerce Department reported this week that consumer spending on goods and services, everything from automobiles to restaurants, surged in July.
