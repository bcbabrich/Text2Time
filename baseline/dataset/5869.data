The University of Louisville Athletic Association called a special meeting of its personnel committee and a special meeting of its board of directors for this morning, and the president of the university, Donald C. Swain, called a news conference for immediately afterward.

But although the university refused to say what he would announce, the president apparently couldn't wait to spread the news. He told Louisville's Mayor, Harvey I. Sloane, that Howard Schnellenberger had agreed to come home and take over the Louisville football program. Schnellenbrger, a former Louisville resident who coached the University of Miami for five seasons, has been the target of an intensive recruitment drive by Louisville officials.
