Government investigators charged at a House committee hearing today that Morton Thiokol Inc. and the space agency have been lax the past several years in correcting problems with quality control and safety at the company's production facilities for shuttle rockets.

Top officials of the General Accounting Office testified that investigators from the Congressional agency, the Air Force and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration had all found potentially serious inspection and management problems at Utah facilities of Morton Thiokol, which made the booster rocket for the flight of the shuttlecraft Challenger.

The problems, the witnesses said, include several fires and explosions over the past two years that destroyed some production facilities, failure to conduct mandatory quality control inspections of rocket components and a ''dismal'' record of correcting deficiencies that had been pointed out.

A joint Air Force-Thiokol study conducted after the space shuttle Challenger exploded Jan. 28, killing the seven members of the crew, found that three of seven mandatory Government inspections of the critical seals in the booster rocket had not been carried out, the G.A.O. officials said. The failure of such a seal led to the disaster. Need for Reform Stressed
