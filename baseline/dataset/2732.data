Ms. Clarke

The coalition continues to make good progress toward ending the Iraqi regime, freeing the Iraqi people and disarming the country of weapons of mass destruction.

As Secretary Rumsfeld and others reminded us yesterday, coalition troops are within 50 miles of the Iraqi capital; we are approaching Baghdad from the north, the south and the west; we have taken Iraq's only port and control its coastline; the oil wells in the south are being secured for the Iraqi people; and we recently hit a large terrorist facility in northern Iraq.

The bombing continues to weaken the command-and-control leadership. Since the coalition bombed Saddam's headquarters at the very beginning of the war, the world has neither seen his hide nor hair, only tapes. We've not seen his sons. We have seen evidence that family members are fleeing the country, or trying to flee the country.
