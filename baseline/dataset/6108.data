Of all the annual accolades in baseball, the most controversial are invariably the Most Valuable Player awards. And in the American League this season, the Yankees’ most controversial player, Reggie Jackson, has emerged as the most controversial candidate in what looms as a most controversial election. When the Yankees hired him for nearly $3 million over five seasons. The Times Reggie Jackson was described by Thurman Munson as slugger “who cart carry a club for a month.” Reggie Jackson exceeded that reputation. Since being knighted as the cleanup hitter, he has carried the Yankees for nearly two months in their quest for another Eastern Division title. For the season he has 32 home runs and 111 runs batted in.

“But,” said a cynic recently, “he's not worth $3 million.”

Reggie Jackson never said he was worth that much. But when the Yankees offered him that much, he accepted it. Actually, the Montreal Expos offered him more than $3 million, but he preferred to perform in New York where the stage suits his style. Or so he thought.

But in the early months of the season, Reggie Jackson was a stranger in turmoil. He feuded with Thurman Munson, a rift that is not completely healed. He antagonized other teammates. And he bristled at Billy Martin, who bristled back at the slugger he hadn't requested.

Even now Reggie Jackson and Billy Martin coexist in an armed truce, but Reggie Jackson ‘has earned the respect, if not the afefction, of his manager and teammates.
