GROTON, Conn., May 31 - Gov. M. Jodi Rell and members of Connecticut's Congressional delegation, who are fighting to keep open the historic Naval submarine base here, expressed cautious optimism after touring the facility Tuesday with members of an independent federal commission considering whether the base should be closed.

Four of the nine members of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, including its chairman, Anthony J. Principi, visited the base and asked questions of Navy staff members. The Pentagon has proposed closing the base as part of a nationwide restructuring that would include shutting down 33 major bases. The commission, known as BRAC, will recommend to President Bush by Sept. 8 whether to adopt the Pentagon plan.

On Tuesday, state and federal elected officials along for the tour and briefing said the commissioners questioned Navy officials on issues ranging from the cost of relocating the base's training school, to quality of life in the area for base employees and their families, to the importance of the close relationship between the base and a large private contractor, Electric Boat, which builds and repairs submarines just south of the base on the Thames River.

"Their questions are very much: 'Are we saving money? Are we actually going to produce the results that the Department of Defense claims? Would we in fact be better off if we did something else?"' Mrs. Rell told reporters afterward. "And again, those kinds of questions, while the Navy has to give data and a factual response, I thought boded very well for us."
