There are social theorists who lament the privatization of child's play, once the most communal of activities. "I have seen articles that basically disapprove of any kind of environment short of a kibbutz," Rick Grossberg, Discovery Zone's eastern region marketing director, acknowledged.

But parents who take their children there -- admittedly a self-selected sample -- were happy to have a place where the children can romp under the alert eyes of the company's supervisors, called coaches, and where adults may even escape the din in a soundproof windowed area called the Quiet Zone.

Fear of crime is almost always first on parents' minds, particularly in this suburb of Trenton, where people still shake their heads over the rape and murder last summer of Megan Kanka, the 9-year-old who went out to play and fell victim to a neighbor. At the Discovery Zone, parents and children are given bracelets with matching numbers that they must show and surrender before leaving. But fear of crime is not the only reason for the play center's popularity:

"Matthew is an only child, and this is a place where he can be with other kids," said Nadine Sheppard, a Hamilton housewife. Indeed, Matthew was at that moment instructing another tot, "Look at me!"

Meanwhile, Terri Morrow had just returned to her native Trenton after a few years in Tucson, Ariz., and since she had not yet found a job, and her sisters were all at work, it fell to her to shepherd her own 3-year-old Justin and his four cousins to the monster playpen.

"It's Christmas, I'm not working -- Kenny, pull your pants up! -- the kids all have cabin fever; this is just a great place for them all to work off steam," Ms. Morrow said.

Discovery Zone has child psychologists on staff, who maintain, in a company release, that "cabin fever can trigger physical effects, including weight gain, digestive problems, insomnia or other sleeping problems, and can impair the development of children's motor skills."

Another company release suggests that public playgrounds may not be the answer. The company distributes a May 1994 study by the Illinois Public Interest Research Council and the Consumer Federation of America claiming, on the basis of a sample of some 400 sites, that more than 90 percent of the country's public playgrounds are dangerous, contributing each year to 17 deaths and 170,000 injuries serious enough to warrant emergency room treatment.
