QUEBEC, Dec. 1 (Reuters)—Quebec provincial police raided the headquarters of the opposition Liberal Party in Montreal yesterday and seized party membership lists, Gerard D. Ldvesque, the Liberal leader, charged today.

His accusation caused the Quebec National Assembly to suspend its session abruptly when Justice Minister MarcAndre Bedard said he was unable to explain the reason for the raid.

Mr. Levesque, who is opposition leader to the ruling Parti Quebecois government of Rene Levesque, said the police had entered the Liberal Party's headquarters with a warrant and had taken a 326‐page list of persons who had contributed to a party fund‐raising campaign. Quebec has no law governing the financing of political parties.

[Mr. Bedard said that the police had also raided the Union Nationale Party headquarters yesterday,, in addition to the Liberal Party, as part of a two‐year investigation into possible corruption within the Quebec Liquor Corporation, according to The Associated Press.]
