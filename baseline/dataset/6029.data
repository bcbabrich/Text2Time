ATLANTA, May 1—As part of President Carter's plan for “Voluntary” control of inflation; the Administration is prepared to subpoena corporate records and publicly criticize companies that do not hold down prices, the director of the Council on Wage and Price Stability said here today.

The director. Barry F. Bosworth, also said that the Administration would press business executives to hold their salary increases to 5 percent and would ask “high visibility unions” to accept much smaller increases in new contracts.

Mr. Bosworth, who was speaking at a luncheon at the annual convention of the American Newspaper Publishers’ As- sociation, said that doctors, dentists, lawyers and other professional groups would also be called upon “in the very near future” to hold down increases in their fees.

The speech by the 35-year-old econo mist was one of the bluntest by a high official since thd start of the Administration's effort to limit inflation by exhortation rather than through wage and price controls.
