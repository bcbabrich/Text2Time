A health care union that staged strikes at 39 nursing homes this year is suing the state for reimbursing private nursing homes for strike-related costs at private nursing homes. The New England Health Care Employees Union, District 1199, says that an estimated $26 million in reimbursements violated state rules. Dean Pagani, a spokesman for Gov. John G. Rowland, said the payments were legal and necessary for the safety and welfare of nursing home residents.
