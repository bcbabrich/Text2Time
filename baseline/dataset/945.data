Poor Nell can’t catch a break. In “The Last Exorcism” (2010) this Louisiana teenager was possessed by the demon Abalam and ultimately bore his progeny, only to have their unholy offspring disposed of by solemn hooded attendants. In “The Last Exorcism: Part II” she has survived that ordeal, unlike her father (or so it appears), the documentary crew filming her and the minister of lapsed faith who attempted to coax out her tormentor.

Now she’s in a house for recovering trauma patients in New Orleans, and Abalam has again come a-courting. But only indirectly, making overtures through greasepainted human statues (the kind in Times Square), birds hitting windows, voices hidden in radio static and the ubiquitous presence of insects. (Clearly “The Last Exorcism” was a misnomer.)

Nell’s roommate, Gwen (the very interesting though very underused Julia Garner, star of the coming “Electrick Children,” a hit at South by Southwest), isn’t much help with Nell’s suitor. But a hardy group of demon-relocation specialists (including E. Roger Mitchell) gives it a shot.

“The Last Exorcism Part II” belongs to a flourishing genre you could call terror tease. Devoid of nudity, gore and obscene dialogue, PG-13 films like the “Paranormal Activity” series and the first “Last Exorcism” eschew graphic violence for mood and minor scares — perfect for Friday-night mall outings without Mom and Dad. If only they gave you more to think about.
