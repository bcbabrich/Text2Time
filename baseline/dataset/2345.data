To the Editor:

As the numbers of dead and lost in the tsunami disaster continue to strain our credulity, doesn't it seem incongruous that from the hourly news about the stock market, sporting events and sundry national or local matters we might very well imagine that what has been occurring in Southeast Asia is not really happening?

Given the fact that so much of our lives must now take account of global influences that bear on us, shouldn't there be some public reminder of what masses of humanity have been going through? Flags flown at half staff or some such symbol of mourning would at least let us know that everything is not business as usual.
