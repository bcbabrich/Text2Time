You probably don't need a survey to learn that few passengers, especially those sitting in coach, rave about airline meals. But just the same, the International Air Transport Association recently asked some of its member airlines to find out what passengers do like to eat. The unscientific results were released today.

The answer? Most Asian passengers prefer fish, while chicken and beef are tied as the favorite dish over all.

Beef had been No. 1 for many years, the association said, but ''chicken's popularity has been steadily rising, particularly since the recent mad cow threat in Europe.'' In fact, the trade group noted, Austrian Airlines has removed beef from all flights except those originating in the United States.

Most of the 22 airlines in the survey said chicken was the easiest dish to prepare for mass consumption anyway. As a spokeswoman for Continental Airlines explained, chicken ''is able to withstand the rigors of airline catering and onboard heating.'' The only carrier with a preference for beef was All Nippon Airways, whose spokesman called it ''less difficult to prepare in advance simply because it does not overcook and dry out as easily as fish and chicken.''
