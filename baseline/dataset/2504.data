But changes in politics and medicine have made it time for that approach to change, the authors of the article write. Besides Dr. Frieden, they are Dr. Scott E. Kellerman, assistant health commissioner for H.I.V. prevention and control; Dr. Moupali Das-Douglas, a former special assistant to Dr. Frieden; and Dr. Kelly J. Henning, a special adviser to the commissioner.

In an interview, Dr. Frieden said yesterday that the article reflected the directions in which he was already steering city policy. "We're getting out a million condoms a month, we're testing a lot more people than we used to test," and the city has begun financial support for needle exchange programs, he said.

But some changes, he added, can be pursued only with more money, or with changes in laws that were intended to guard the privacy of people with H.I.V. State law requires a patient to sign a separate written consent form for an H.I.V. test -- as opposed to blanket forms that permit whatever tests a doctor sees fit.

Doctors supply to the state detailed information on how individual H.I.V. patients are faring. But the state did not share it with local health departments until this year, and the agencies still cannot legally do anything with it. So while the city closely monitors the cases of people with many other diseases, and has a hand in managing their treatment, it cannot do so with H.I.V. -- though tens of thousands of people receive case management from private groups with government funds.

"We could tell you not just who has TB, but what treatment they're on, whether they're responding to that treatment," Dr. Frieden said. "I know who their contacts are, whether their contacts are infected, and if they're infected, whether they've started treatment. All of those things, I can't tell you a single one of them about H.I.V. But TB killed 25 people in New York City last year, and H.I.V. killed 2,000."
