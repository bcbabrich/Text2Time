The Speaker of the Iranian Parliament called Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House, an imbecile.

The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Jordanian Parliament passed a resolution condemning him for "inappropriate" remarks about the need to move the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.

But the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, found him as exciting as Margaret Thatcher.

In the corridors of power around the world, the Speaker of the House is generating the same extreme and befuddled responses as he is in domestic politics.

Is he, as Der Spiegel, Germany's largest circulation news magazine, speculated, "America's surrogate President?" Is he, as magazine billboards in metro stations in Paris assert, the man who "dictates his law to the U.S.A.?"

And if that is so, why stop there? Tony Blankley, Mr. Gingrich's British-born spokesman suggested his boss was really like Winston Churchill, Charles de Gaulle, Anwar el-Sadat and Mohandas Gandhi, wrapped into one deeply misunderstood, comfortably overweight American revolutionary package.
