MONDAY PUZZLE — Crossword constructors are creative people and, as a group, can be very sensitive. It is for that reason that we need to cheer up Randall J. Hartman, because based on his theme, I think he’s being hard on himself.

So, chin up, Mr. Hartman. There is some good stuff in your puzzle — I liked NERF GUN and the twin Superman clues — and you get to start off our solving week.

Today’s Theme

Mr. Hartman offers us a list set of phrases (I can’t really call them all “familiar” for reasons I’ll get into in a minute) in which the last word is a synonym for “failure.” For example, at 17A, we have the clue “Air Force smart weapon” for LASER GUIDED BOMB. Similarly, at 43A, “Thanksgiving entree” is ROAST TURKEY.

What surprised me was the inclusion of something as obscure as the FOSBURY FLOP at 25A. It’s a magnificent name, but if I had made this puzzle, I’m not sure I would have put that in a Monday theme set. It’s a debut to The New York Times Crossword, and there may be a reason for that. How many people really know about “Pioneering high jump maneuvers” from the 1960s? Also, the Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis movie from 1956, their swan song “HOLLYWOOD OR BUST,” might not be well known to some solvers.
