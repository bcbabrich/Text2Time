While Dr. Edelson was focusing on immunology, John A. Parrish, then a young dermatologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, was exploring what seemed to be a different puzzle, the role of photobiology in treating skin disease. But Dr. Edelson's cancer experiment arose from the drug-and-light-based therapy that Dr. Parrish and his team had developed for severe psoriasis.

Dr. Parrish, now director of the Wellman Laboratories of Photomedicine at Massachusetts General, had been experimenting with a centuries-old treatment for vitiligo, a fairly common disease caused by the absence of pigment cells in certain parts of the skin which results in a checkerboard appearance. Ancient Egyptians had extracted a chemical, 8-methoxypsoralen, from limes, figs and various plants and used it in combination with sunlight to treat the disease. The interplay of drug and light caused a deep, uniform tan that hid the patches of colorless skin. Dr. Parrish administered the drug in pill form and activated it with artificial ultraviolet light, which was more controllable than sunlight.

When he discovered that the photoactivated drug could inhibit cell growth, Dr. Parrish shifted his attention to severe psoriasis, a nonlethal but disfiguring scaling-skin disease, which, like cancer, involves the abnormal and disorderly growth of cells. His work led to PUVA - psoralen plus ultraviolet type A - which revolutionized the treatment of psoriasis. With PUVA, Dr. Parrish and his team added a new word to the medical lexicon: photochemotherapy - light plus drug plus treatment.

Dr. Edelson's epiphany came one day in 1976, when, as an assistant professor of dermatology at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, he was explaining how PUVA works to a psoriasis patient about to undergo the treatment at Columbia-Presbyterian: You ingest a dose of psoralen and wait a few hours for the drug to be absorbed. Then you stand in a chamber lined with tubes emitting ultraviolet light. The light activates the drug, which in turn halts the abnormal growth of skin cells.

It occurred to Dr. Edelson then that ultraviolet light might also be able to affect the diseased white cells characteristic of C.T.C.L. in its advanced stages. If suitable materials could be found through which ultraviolet light might pass, the whole procedure could be done safely outside of the body.

DR. EDELSON EXPERIMENTED with culture dishes used in the lab and found that certain plastics permitted ultraviolet light to penetrate their surface. ''In my mind,'' Dr. Edelson recalls, ''the question then became, 'Is this concept too cute to work?' ''

There was, however, a practical basis for his idea. Investigators at Massachusetts General had proven that PUVA can affect the life span of lymphocytes. Dr. Edelson was already working with a process involving the removal of T-cells. But he needed a way to deliver the light to the patient's psoralen-bathed blood cells and then get the damaged cells back into the body so that the spleen, a major repository for T-cells, could jump-start the flagging immune system.
