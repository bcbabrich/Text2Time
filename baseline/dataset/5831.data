From the uncertainty of football unemployment to the status of most valuable player in a Super Bowl game, Jim Plunkett has long understood the realities of his game. ''If I don't play well, I'll get replaced,'' he said. ''That's what it boils down to.''

Not long ago, when he had been demoted to the role of second-string quarterback for the Los Angeles Raiders, Plunkett wondered if his professional career had reached the beginning of the end in its 13th season.

But now, in the midst of the latest in his remarkable series of comebacks, he has helped lead the Raiders into Sunday's American Conference playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and he is again being closely examined. Observers come to visit in an attempt to discover some magic ingredient that has helped Plunkett overcome the latest setback in his career. His success, this year and in the Super Bowl season of 1980, have made this search a routine.

''I don't know what it is,'' Plunkett said. Decision for Steelers

He could also sympathize with the participants in the unusual postseason quarterback competition going on less than an hour away at Thousand Oaks, where the Steelers have been practicing. The Steelers had not named a starting quarterback. Chuck Noll, the head coach, said the decision would not be made until Sunday.
