WASHINGTON, Dec. 31 —The 88th Congress, which ended its first session yesterday, has left behind it a long list of unfinished business.

It will get another chance soon. The second session convenes a week from today.

Because the new session will permit the work to proceed without the need of further organization of committees and subcommittees, more progress may well be made than during the year‐long first session.

This, at least, is the hope of the Democratic leadership as it scans more than a score of programs still awaiting action.

The most bitter and protracted contests are expected over the two high‐priority items of unfinished business—the civil rights and tax reduction programs.
