CityRealty.com, an online company for residential real estate in New York City, began operating a new Web site last week. The site is designed to connect buyers and renters with brokers. The company, which changed its name from nyrealty.com several months ago, collects listings from various sources, including property owners and brokers. Brokers and buyers can search the information, officials said. The Web site includes listings for more than 1,000 apartment buildings in the city, and applications that allow many transactions traditionally conducted on paper to be done online. These include mortgage- and loan-related forms. Buyers and renters can have the company notify them by e-mail as properties become available.
