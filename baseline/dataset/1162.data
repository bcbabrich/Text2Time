Jimmy Conrad is a pretty boy who has a hankering for some ugly soccer.

“What this league needs is a team like the Oakland Raiders,” said Conrad, the new, fresh face of KickTV on YouTube, a joint venture of Google, Soccer United Marketing (the commercial arm of Major League Soccer) and Bedrocket Media Ventures. “Every league needs a team to hate. Players to dislike.”

Some might disagree with Conrad, a former M.L.S. and United States national team defender. Guys like Los Angeles Galaxy Coach Bruce Arena who is partial to the Dynasty Theory, as in what every league needs is a Yankees or Celtics … teams on a pedestal setting the standard for others to attempt to match. It is all open for debate.

What is certain these days is that the appetite of soccer fans for ever more soccer — or content in the language of the Internet age — can never be satisfied.

“I think that all sports probably benefit from the Internet in that it allows fans to truly immerse themselves,” said Brian Bedol of Bedrocket Media Ventures by telephone from his offices in the Soho section of Manhattan. “I’ve been involved in sports on the Internet for a decade now, having launched College Sports TV and operated some 300 sites for major university sports programs. I’ve realized that fans are not just looking for games on TV. When they’re connected to a team and a sport they want total immersion.

“Starting from the level of sports fans using the Internet in multiple way to support their passion, I would say soccer is a sport that globally benefited from the Internet in a huge way because of the nature of the game.”

He added: “Soccer is a global sport and that is part of what makes it so unique and engaging. It’s not just about what’s going on in your own backyard. American sports media over the last 25 years, until recently, has focused on the major American sports and had a lack of shelf space committed to covering soccer. Fans immediately were drawn to the Net as a place to get a wealth of coverage to satisfy their interest.”

KickTV is part of an effort by YouTube, which is owned by Google, to seed budding professional producers with $100 million to start channels dedicated to all and sundry topics from dancing to self-help to sports.

According to a recent article in USA Today, a survey by Nielsen found that the average person is currently watching 30 minutes of video online a week, though the figure is 60 minutes for people between the ages of 25 and 34. And when it comes to soccer, that is the prime sweet spot for advertisers interested in a generally well-educated, co-ed fan base that has embraced the game locally and globally.

KickTV is a channel dedicated to presenting original programming and features with on-air talent that includes Conrad; the former Liverpool player and New England Revolution coach Steve Nicol; the former Houston and current Bolton midfielder Stuart Holden; and the English Olympian Jo Ankier.

“This has a much broader focus than the content on MLSsoccer.com,” said Chris Schlosser, the general manager of M.L.S. Digital. “Kick was created as a global channel that allows us to tell the key soccer stories of the day and to broaden our voice beyond the M.L.S. channel. All the content is original and exclusive to the channel and YouTube.”

The channel, which launched March 2, currently has more than 10,000 subscribers who have viewed nearly 2 million videos.

“We’re not trying to create ESPN,” Schlosser said. “This is something specific for an audience that wants a lighter voice than the official M.L.S. site. It’s intended to be fun and informative, with content you can’t get anywhere else. I see it as the home for soccer fans on YouTube; when they get up in the morning they can go to KickTV to see what’s up in the soccer world.”

The channel’s current offerings include: the Mixer (a daily wrapup of the game around the globe); the Whip (a weekly review of top stories from England’s Premier League); Champions League Whip (a review of top stories from the UEFA tournament); No Holden Back (featuring the stylings of Bolton’s Holden); Kick Academy (drills and exercises offered by professional coaches); Kick Classic (pop-up video style for great games in the site’s archive); and Kick Profiles (in-depth looks at the world’s best players).

“At some point there could be live games on Kick,” Bedol said. “But for now we want to provide the ultimate destination for fans to hang out between games and get smarter about teams and the game around the world.”

He added: “On cable, programming was only available to the number of homes the operators gave access to. It was never global. On this platform, anyone who’s interested in seeing it from anywhere in the world can get access. In cable, you’re in a gated community. On YouTube, your in a world of literally millions. It has the ability to be a game changer.”
