Tyrone Corbin made an off-balance jump shot with three seconds to play to give DePaul a 59-57 overtime victory over Creighton today.

It was the the second time in two seasons that Creighton (7-2) had lost a 2-point game to DePaul (9-0).

''This is what you call winning ugly,'' said the DePaul coach, Ray Meyer. ''I was afraid of this ball club, and we certainly didn't play well.''

DePaul trailed most of the first half, falling behind by 26-16 and 28-18 with 57 seconds remaining in the half.
