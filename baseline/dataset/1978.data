Governor Eliot Spitzer signed five executive orders in his first morning as governor of New York, including orders establishing a number of ethical guidelines for state workers and making the government more open to the public.

During a signing ceremony at about 8:45 a.m. at the executive mansion, Mr. Spitzer said he was fulfilling a promise “that one of the first acts I would take as governor, officially, was to put in place a series of ethics guidelines and strictures that would begin the process of restoring government to what it should be, which is responsive, open, transparent, available to the public and to the extent feasible, insulated from the influence of improper gifts and contributions.”

“I am hoping that others in other branches will join me in this,” he added.

He signed the orders on a desk once used by Theodore Roosevelt, in a room of the mansion known as “the History Room,” which also includes a wheelchair used by Franklin Roosevelt. After Mr. Spitzer finished signing the orders and had answered some questions, he strode out of the room, but he and his wife Silda were drawn back in after his dogs Jesse (Bichon Frisé) and James (Wheaten Terrier) bolted in and began barking at members of the news media.

Asked how much sleep he had gotten, Mr. Spitzer said “probably not enough.”

“I think I came upstairs, from downstairs, at about 12:30, probably went to sleep at about 1, but I will admit that about 4:30, combination of wondering what the weather was going to be this morning, I started getting up to peer out the window.”

Mr. Spitzer’s first executive order prohibited state workers at public agencies and authorities from accepting gifts or more than nominal value and prohibited the use of state property, including vehicles, computers and telephones, for non-official business. And in what seemed to be a reference to the scandal that led to the resignation of former Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, the order said that individuals authorized by their agency to use a vehicle for personal purposes “shall keep records of such use, and the value of such personal use shall be calculated and reported as personal income.”

The same order also prohibited nepotism in hiring and contracting and barred former state workers from lobbying their former agency for two years.

The second order prohibited state workers from donating money to the campaigns of the governor or lieutenant governor, or affiliated political action committees.

“I do not believe it looks proper for individuals who work for the governor, the lieutenant governor, to be making contributions,” he said, adding, “the appearance might be that they have been expected to do so, or it is a condition of employment. None of that should exist.”

The order also barred employment officials from asking job candidates about their party affiliation and barred state officials from appearing in advertisements paid for by state entities, a frequent practice of former Gov. George E. Pataki. The order also prohibited commissioners and executive directors of agencies and public authorities from running for public office without first resigning.

In a third order, the governor said all state agencies and authorities must come up with a plan to broadcast their meetings on the Internet, if they are subject to the state’s Open Meetings Law.

“It may be that nobody clicks through and watches, but at least the possibility of watching what these boards do and how they meet and how they discuss the issues is important,” Mr. Spitzer said.

A fourth order established judicial screening committees to evaluate and recommend judicial candidates for a range of judgeships across the state.

A fifth order, which Mr. Spitzer described as “ministerial,” continued a number of executive orders from the Cuomo and Pataki administrations.

As his dogs bounded around the room, the governor was asked if he would let them eat any of the new official paperwork.

“If it’s tasty,” he replied, “why not?”
