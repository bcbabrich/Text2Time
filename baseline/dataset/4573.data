Federal prosecutors plan to bolster their racketeering case against John Gotti by presenting evidence that he authorized six murders, besides the five murders charged in his trial, court documents disclosed yesterday.

In the documents, the prosecutors said they would use the additional six murders as evidence to support the racketeering charge against Mr. Gotti, who is charged with being the boss of the Gambino crime family.

Opening statements in the trial of Mr. Gotti and his co-defendant, Frank Locascio, are expected next week after jury selection is completed for the case in Federal District Court in Brooklyn.

The court documents, which involve a defense motion to exclude information about the six additional murders as prejudicial, did not indicate where the prosecution obtained the latest information. But it is believed to have come from Salvatore Gravano, originally a defendant regarded as Mr. Gotti's most trusted associate, who turned informer.
