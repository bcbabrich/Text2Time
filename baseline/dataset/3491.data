''I had no timing on my serve at all, almost throughout the whole match,'' Becker said. ''Every time I served it was a struggle, and for my part, it was very unfortunate that I wasn't able to give him and the crowd a better match for my last match.''

Still, his Wimbledon match record stands at 71-12 and his 116-25 record on grass remains the best of any active player, including the five-time Wimbledon champion Sampras. And a proprietary Becker has called Center Court his birthplace ever since he stormed unseeded to the 1985 championship at 17.

After saving one match point with a service winner but surrendering the second with a misguided backhand half-volley, Becker made his last bow in the direction of the Royal Box. Its occupants marked the 31-year-old's official retirement from the Grand Slam stage by joining in giving him a standing ovation.

''It's been an incredible ride,'' Becker said. ''I'm thankful I was able to have the chance to come back and play decent tennis and now it's time to go do something else.''

Becker had originally retired from Grand Slam strife at Wimbledon in 1997, when he fell to Sampras in the quarterfinals and told the stunned winner he was quitting during their netside handshake. Becker decided to play one last Wimbledon when he realized that, with a second child on the way in August, he would be quitting the tour altogether this summer to concentrate on his family.

The 61st-ranked Courier, now 28, briefly quit tennis last summer, but he was lured back by the prospect of playing in the Davis Cup, and his decision proved to be felicitous when he upset both Henman and Rusedski in the first round at Birmingham in April, a coup that enabled the United States to be host to Australia in the second round at Longwood Cricket Club next month.

But Courier's inspiring campaign here at Wimbledon, where he reached the Round of 16 for the first time since his run to the final in 1993, ended with the 4-6, 7-5, 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 9-7 defeat to Henman today. The match had been halted by rain Monday evening with Henman ahead by 4-3 in the third set and was further delayed by Tuesday's washout.
