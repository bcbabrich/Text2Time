What will certainly prove to be one of the most inspired birthday celebrations of the dance year occurred on Tuesday night when Jennifer Muller/The Works opened its 30th anniversary season at the Joyce Theater. The program, one of two to be presented during a weeklong engagement, included the obligatory world premiere and a suite of excerpts from dances choreographed by Ms. Muller between 1975 and 1988. Then came "Speeds," a signature Muller work created in 1974.

This group piece is a jazzy, boisterous romp through a score by Ms. Muller's longtime collaborator, Burt Alcantara. William Katz's white suits, tunics and hats have the trademark Muller chic. And the dance courses happily along, through tender, fleeting duets and carefully plotted free-for-alls for a stageful of dancers. Interspersed are cross-stage lineups of slithering dancers who look like the "Bayadere" Shades gone funky. There are periodic cries of "Change," which give the dance a quaint feel. Blessedly, the kinds of self-conscious stage directions dancers called out to one another in the 1970's are mostly a thing of the past.

Here, however, there was a special poignancy and pizazz to those commands. For change was represented not only in the quick shifts of speed and dynamics that give the dance its name but also in Ms. Muller's moment of stillness in memory of deceased company members and, more joyously, in 10 former Muller dancers who augmented the cast for this first-night performance.

Some looked as if they wanted never to leave. Others seemed a little nervous about their technique and endurance. Two in particular -- Young Soon Kim and Ed Burgess -- looked as if they should not have left. Mr. Burgess's lithe, all-out dancing and expression of happy triumph were the highlight of the evening.
