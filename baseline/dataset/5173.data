The chairman of Japan's biggest tire company, the Bridgestone Corporation, will come to the United States next year to supervise the affairs of the company's North American unit, Bridgestone/Firestone Inc.

Teiji Eguchi, 63 years old, will arrive in Akron, Ohio, early next year, the North American division said yesterday. He will not be employed by the North American unit or sit on its board, the unit said, but he will ''expedite decision-making'' and ''assure a smooth coordination of activities with top management in Tokyo.''

The company's announcement said that Bridgestone's board had determined that Mr. Eguchi's relocation would underscore the crucial importance of Bridgestone/Firestone, Bridgestone's largest subsidiary.

Mr. Eguchi, who has been with the company for 40 years, has helped to lead Bridgestone as it has grown into the world's third-largest tire maker.
