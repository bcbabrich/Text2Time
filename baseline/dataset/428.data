But these bits are scattered in an uneven series of sketches piled and paper-clipped together like the documents on the table. The show’s twin political preoccupations of colonialism and gender often split apart, and the successive segments, sometimes separating into just sound or just film, are widely spaced, as if Mr. Hafez didn’t trust his audience to process more than one idea or sensation at a time. Instead, for large swaths of the nearly two-hour duration, he seems determined to make viewers experience the terrible boredom of any political conference, even one that upends the world.

Boredom is also risked in “-55,” a solo that the Moroccan choreographer Raduoan Mriziga performed at New York Live Arts on Thursday. In street clothes, he executes a series of tasks, eventually creating an intricate design on the floor with chalk and tape. The title tells you how many minutes it takes.

Since 2008, Mr. Mriziga has lived and worked in Brussels, where he attended the influential school P.A.R.T.S. “-55,” his first work, seems to be in a familiar mode of Euro-American postmodernism. The initial motions — walking, arm swinging, lying on his back — are pedestrian, though lightly decorated with snaps, claps, curlicues and hand-to-foot suggestions of folk dance. Segments repeat, in different orientations.

In addition to the body percussion, sound comes from five cassette decks placed (as is the audience) on four sides surrounding Mr. Mriziga. The sound is highly fragmentary, as if mostly erased. When Mr. Mriziga lays out his floor geometry, he measures its proportions with his body: a line twice his height, a circle traced from the turning point of an elbow with the radius of a forearm.
