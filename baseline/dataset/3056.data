Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students will explore the effect of computers and word processing on traditional forms of communication and expression.



Author(s):

Rachel McClain, The New York Times Learning Network

Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Write about their preference for either handwriting or word processing.

2. Learn about the effect that word processing is having on the tradition of handwriting in China by reading and discussing the article “Where the Pen is Mightier Than the PC.”

3. Create and conduct a survey in class on the effect of computer usage on traditional forms of communication and expression

4. Conduct the class survey on a group within their community and create posters displaying the results.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-paper

-classroom board

-poster board

-markers

-copies of the article “Where the Pen is Mightier Than the PC” (one per student)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journals, students will respond to the following prompt (written on the board prior to class): If your teacher gave you the option of writing an essay by hand or typing it on a computer, which would you choose? What advantages does this method provide? What disadvantages might this method present? After allowing students to write for a few minutes, have some students share their answers with the class.



2. As a class, read the article “Where the Pen is Mightier Than the PC,” focusing on the following questions:

a. How much of his writing does Mr. Li do on a computer?

b. What does Mr. Li define as the trend of societal progress?

c. How has writing both united and divided the Chinese?

d. What Chinese phrase means the same thing as the English idiom “on the tip of my tongue”?

e. How does the transliteration system “pinyin” work?

f. How many characters can be associated with the typed word “ma”? What meanings do two of these characters have?

g. Why can’t Ehren Fairfield spell?

h. Why does Professor Xu think that the computer will prevail over the pen?



3. As a class, develop a list of ten questions that will be the basis of a survey about the role of computers in writing and the effect that computer usage has on traditional forms of communication and expression. Suggestions for the types of questions to include in the survey are: What percentage of your writing do you do on a computer? How many hours a day do you spend on the computer? Do you generally prefer to type something or handwrite it? After creating the survey, tally the class’ responses and record them on a poster board. Then, create a list of different groups of people with whom the class could conduct the survey (e.g., “people over 65,” “housewives,” “college students”) and how students think these responses might differ from those of the class.



4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: In pairs, students conduct the survey developed in class on one of the groups on the class list. Before conducting the survey, pairs should predict the outcome of each answer, based on what they know about the computer usage trends of this group of people. Students then conduct the survey and create a poster displaying their findings, and comparing them with their initial predictions. Pairs report their findings to the class.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–What percentage of your writing do you think you do on a computer? What percentage of your parents’ writing is done on a computer?

–What other cultural “traditions” can you think of that are threatened by increased computer usage?

–How have computers changed your classroom experience in the last few years? Do you think this change is for the better?

–What is the original quotation from which the author of the article derives her title, “Where the Pen is Mightier Than the PC”? What does the original quotation mean?

–Which do you value more: tradition or progress? Why?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated on completion of journal entries, participation in class discussion, and performance of surveys on computer usage in their community.

Vocabulary:

hazy, summons, anecdotal, undermine, pragmatic, intricate, neuropsycholinguist, phonetically, pinyin, inevitability, context

Extension Activities:

1. Write a short story in English, then translate it into Chinese characters. Transfer each version by hand to posters, then have your teacher show them to the class. Can the class figure out who wrote the story based only on the Chinese version? Can they figure it out based on the English version? What does this say about the significance of handwriting?



2. With a partner, write a set of e-mail correspondences between a “computer savvy” person and a more “traditional” and less computer literate person. The computer savvy person’s emails should include computer slang, abbreviations, and typos or other grammatical mistakes (or changes) that might be found in a quickly written email. The other person’s emails should adhere strictly to correct letter format and be free of typos and grammar mistakes. Throughout the course of the exchange the more traditional partner will become more and more frustrated and confused by the other’s “improper” English.



3. Learn about the role that computers play in other countries. Create a chart comparing such statistics as average number of computers per household, number of computer-related jobs, and average daily Internet traffic in your country, China, and two other countries that you researched.



4. Write a dialogue between a Chinese calligrapher and a young Chinese student who is learning to write Chinese on the computer. Using the article as a reference, have the characters discuss the roles of tradition and progress in Chinese society as they are impacted by the shift away from handwriting.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Research the history of note-taking in the American classroom. Create a timeline depicting the standard method through which students have taken notes in the last 200 years, and include a prediction of how note-taking might look in 2010.



Fine Arts- Learn the art of Chinese calligraphy and create a Chinese character in calligraphy, accompanied by a picture of what the character represents, to be displayed in your classroom.



Health- With increased computer usage for writing and research come increased health hazards. Research the dangers of overexposure to computers and create a pamphlet informing people of the dangers of overexposure to computers and the precautions they can take.



Mathematics- Write a short paragraph. Have a sample of people of different ages write the paragraph by hand, then type it on a computer. Record the time it takes for each person to complete the paragraph and create a graph of the average times for people of different ages. As an extra variable, conduct the same test, but give the original paragraph to half of the subjects in handwritten form, and to the other half in typed form. Were the results different based on the format of the original paragraph?



Science- Read a book on handwriting analysis, then conduct your own handwriting analysis of a friend. Have a third party obtain a sample from someone you know, and not tell you whose handwriting you are looking at, so that you will not be biased by your prior knowledge of the person’s traits. Analyze the sample. When you are done, have the person tell you whose writing it is. Did you accurately describe this person? Did you learn something new about this person through their handwriting?
