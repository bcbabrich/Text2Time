The terror attacks in Mumbai have led to the cancellation of the annual Sangat Chamber Music Festival, but the three concerts will go on, in Sweden. Alan Gilbert, the music director-in-waiting of the New York Philharmonic, arranged to have the festival moved to Stockholm, where he lives because of his stint as music director of the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra. Mr. Gilbert had planned to attend the festival this December, because his wife, the cellist Kajsa William-Olsson, is a performer. Sponsors, including the Stockholm Philharmonic’s concert hall, have stepped forward to pay for travel and accommodations for the musicians, who are donating their fees. The festival is run by the Mehli Mehta Foundation, a major promoter of classical music in Mumbai. One of Mehli Mehta’s sons is Zubin Mehta, the conductor, and another is Zarin Mehta, the president of the New York Philharmonic. The concerts take place Dec. 15, 17 and 18.
