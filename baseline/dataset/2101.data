Victoria Azarenka, a 41st-ranked Belarussian, might have just sent Martina Hingis back into retirement, rallying for a 3-6, 6-1, 6-0 victory this afternoon. Azarenka, an 18-year-old who has lived in Scottsdale, Ariz., for two years, shrieked in joy after Hingis, the 1997 champion here, had netted a volley to complete her loss.

The 26-year-old Hingis, who was in semi-retirement from 2002 until 2006, knew before going on Armstrong that No. 2 Maria Sharapova and No. 7 Nadia Petrova, both on her side of the draw, had already lost. She had a chance to at least reach to the quarters, if not the final.

Instead, kids like Azarenka, Agnieszka Radwanska, who defeated Sharpova, and now Tamira Paszek are moving on.

No. 11 Patty Schnyder fell to Paszek of Austria, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (1). Paszek is only 16 but is already ranked No. 43 despite playing a limited schedule.

What is it with these kids? They just donâ€™t respect elders like Schnyder, who is 28. When Schnyder started playing at the Open, Paszek was only 5.
