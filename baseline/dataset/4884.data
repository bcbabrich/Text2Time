HURRYING through the tunnel at Veterans Stadium, the Los Angeles Rams' left guard, Tom Newberry, yelled, ''Warm-weather California sissies, huh?'' With a grin he disappeared into the locker room to calmly celebrate a 21-7 wild-card victory over the Philadelphia Eagles in a cold raw rain, which qualified the Rams to go against the Giants next Sunday at Giants Stadium in the Super Bowl XXIV tournament.

But until yesterday, the Rams had always played like warm-weather California sissies in cold-weather playoff games. Until yesterday, the Rams were 0-9 in cold-weather playoff games since the franchise moved to Los Angeles from Cleveland more than four decades ago. In that time, Ram teams lost three outdoor playoff games in Minnesota (plus one in the warmth of the Metrodome a year ago), two in Washington, and one each in Cleveland, Detroit, Green Bay and Chicago.

''I'm tired of being a weatherman; if I get fired, I'm going right to the news,'' John Robinson, the Rams' coach, joked. ''But this wasn't a very nice day to play football.''

It wasn't a very nice day unless your team won, as Robinson's did, somewhat tediously but decisively. And these Rams enjoyed having accomplished in a cold-weather playoff what all those Ram teams with Bob Waterfield and Deacon Jones and Eric Dickerson never did. But the Eagles' strong safety, Andre Waters, may have inspired them.
