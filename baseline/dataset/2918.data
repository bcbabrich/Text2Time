Other questions have been raised, perhaps most significantly in an investigative series titled ''Digging Deeper'' in The Oregonian, the state's largest newspaper.

The newspaper reported that federal studies had erred in concluding that the project would be a net gain for taxpayers. Proponents vigorously dispute the newspaper's finding.

The Army Corps of Engineers issued a study in 1999 estimating that the project would produce about $2.10 in economic benefits for every $1 it cost. But the newspaper said its analysis suggested it would return only about 88 cents on the dollar.

The corps says it has been updating its analysis. The results have not been released, but Col. Randall J. Butler, the Portland district engineer for the agency, said the benefits of deepening still outweighed the costs.

The plan has the support of legislatures in Oregon and Washington, the states along the parts of the river that would be affected. Each has agreed to contribute $27.7 million to the project, while the federal government would pay the rest. Some smaller port cities along the river also favor the deepening.

The river is routinely dredged to maintain its depth, and the navigation channel, which runs a little more than 100 miles from Portland to the Pacific, has been deepened several times in the last century -- to 25 feet, then 30, then 35, and finally to the current depth of 40 feet.

Each time the argument was that deepening would allow bigger ships to come to port, and shipping did increase. The same reasoning is being used today, though with a twist: in many cases, the issue is not so much the size of the cargo ships. It is that those ships cannot be fully loaded because their draft -- how much of a ship falls below the water line -- would be too deep for the channel.
