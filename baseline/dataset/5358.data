The 3.7 million square feet of offices and 4,000 residences that have been built along with shopping, parking and marina slips have brought color to the drab gray of the Hudson from the George Washington Bridge to the Statue of Liberty. In all, 37 projects have been proposed for the eight old towns along the Hudson River.

Some deals continue to be made. This week the Bank of Tokyo announced it would build a computer data center in a converted warehouse in Jersey City. Last June another Japanese company, Recruit U.S.A., agreed to lease 455,000 square feet of office space about a mile away, also for a computer operation. Fingers Are Crossed

But waterfront developers have been crossing their fingers for another ''big deal'' like those made by Paine Webber in 1986 to lease nearly 1 million square feet of space in Weehawken, and by Melvin Simon Associates to build a 1.2 million-square-foot mall at the Newport project in Jersey City.

In the last year waterfront developers have wooed, but lost, cost-conscious corporate giants. N.B.C., Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers and the American Insurance Group all were enticed by New Jersey's lower taxes and operating costs but remained in New York. One of the biggest disappointments came in November, when Chase Manhattan Bank rejected the Jersey waterfront and decided to move 5,000 of its employees to Brooklyn.

Developers and New Jersey officials believe that the balance was shifted from New Jersey back across the East River to Brooklyn and in some cases Queens by New York City's aggressive moves to retain the companies by offering extraordinary tax incentives and other breaks. Not New Businesses

''Why someone in Flushing has not sued the city yet is beyond me,'' said Morton J. Goldfein, vice president for law and public affairs for Hartz Mountain Industries, one of New Jersey's most active developers. ''These were not incentives to attract new businesses from Fargo or Sault Ste. Marie. These were taxes paid by businesses already in place that won't be paid in the future.''

Governor Kean has been criticized by Representative Frank J. Guarini of Jersey City for not offering special incentives to lure businesses across the river. Mr. Kean defends his hands-off stance and says some companies use the threat of moving to New Jersey just to wrest concessions from New York.
