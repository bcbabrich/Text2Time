Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Identify different American music genres.

2. Learn about the winners in this year’s Grammy Awards by reading and discussing the article “Big Winners at the Grammys: Alicia Keys, U2 and ‘O Brother’.”

3. Research the history, instruments, key musicians, composition and themese of different American music genres.

4. “Produce” radio shows representing their genres.

Resources / Materials:

-recording of 20-30 second selections of six different songs representing the following American music styles: rhythm and blues, jazz, bluegrass, rock, hip-hop and country

-tape recorder or CD player to play the recording

-pens/pencils

-paper

-classroom board

-copies of the article “Big Winners at the Grammys: Alicia Keys, U2 and ‘O Brother'” (one per student)

-resources with information about the history of different American music genres (encyclopedias, library resources, computers with Internet access)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Prior to class, prepare a recording of 20-30 second selections of six different songs representing the following American music styles: rhythm and blues, jazz, bluegrass, rock, hip-hop and country. Write the names of these styles on the board. At the beginning of class, have students number a sheet of paper one to six. Explain that you will be playing six short music selections for the class. As each selection plays, students should write the style of music they think the selection represents. Play the recording twice so that students can confirm their answers. Then, go over the answers as a class, discussing the different elements of each of these different styles of music, such as rhythms, common instruments and melodies. Why are these genres considered to be American? Who are some current popular performers in each genre?

2. As a class, read and discuss the article “Big Winners at the Grammys: Alicia Keys, U2 and ‘O Brother,'” focusing on the following questions:

a. What CD won album of the year in this year’s Grammys?

b. How does the author of the article describe the film “O Brother, Where Art Thou?”

c. Who won best country vocal collaboration?

d. According to the article, what was “one of the night’s most poignant moments”?

e. What awards did Alicia Keys win?

f. What awards did U2 win?

g. How does Bono feel about the effect of September 11 on his music?

h. What were some of the answers to the question about why bluegrass and roots music dominated the Grammys?

i. What “message to the industry” came from the classical field?

3. Explain to students that they will be working in groups to investigate different American music genres and then create mock radio shows representing their findings. Divide class into six groups, and assign each one of the styles from the initial class activity. Using all available materials, each group researches their assigned type of music to discover the answers to the following questions (written on the board for easier student access):

–When and where did this style develop?

–Who have been the major figures (songwriters, performers, bands, etc.) in this style since its birth?

–What instruments are associated with this style of music, and what roles do they play?

–What are the standard rhythms, melodies, chords, and other musical features of this style?

–What are some common topics or themes addressed in the lyrics that accompany this style of music?

–How has this style of music evolved since its inception to today?

Then, each group begins planning a mock radio show exploring the history of their assigned style of music. Each group should include ten recordings from the earliest years of the music’s “recorded” existence through today. Over the course of the show, music selections should be prefaced with spoken introductions addressing the information from the research questions and explaining how the key figures and standard musical features of the genre have changed over the years. Before the end of class, groups should divide responsibilities for finding and bringing in the recordings.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Groups compile and “produce” their radio shows, tape recording them to play in a later class classes as part of an “American Music Festival.”

Further Questions for Discussion:

–How would you define “American music”?

–What is your favorite genre of music? Is there a genre you really dislike? Why?

–What is “popular music”? What genres fit into this larger category?

–What do you think the outcome of the Grammys says about people’s musical tastes?

–Do you think that the Grammy Awards are a measure of talent, popularity, or both? Why?

–Do you think that most artists consider a Grammy Award to be a sign that they have “made it”? Do you think there are artists who do not place importance on the Grammy Awards? What might be the reason for these different points of view?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on participation in initial class activity and class discussion, group research, and accurate and thoughtful American music genre radio shows.

Vocabulary:

contention, climax, wreaked, vengeance, poignant, elliptical, fervent, paeans, predicament, turmoil, consolidation, underdogs

Extension Activities:

1. Compose and perform your own song (music and lyrics) in one of the music styles explored in the class activity. Keep in mind the defining features of this style when creating your song.

2. Create your own “After Mozart” recording (or live performance) modeled after Gidon Kremer and Kremerata Baltica’s album. Choose a classical music piece that lends itself to modern electronic “sound effects” and perform your rendition for the class.

3. Create a “fun facts playbill” to accompany this year’s Grammy Awards. Include information on this year’s nominees and artists who performed in the show. Provide general information about the artists as well as little-known facts, such as childhood nicknames, pet peeves, and favorite foods. (Browse Internet fan sites for this obscure information.)

4. Film a rockumentary about a current musician who you think has contributed the most to American music. Combine real and “fake” (staged between you and a friend playing the role of this musician) interview footage that highlights this artist’s achievements. Also include performance footage and interviews with people in your community commenting on this musician’s contribution to American music.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Civics- Research the controversy behind the unauthorized use of copyrighted music, such as Vanilla Ice’s use of “Under Pressure” in “Ice Ice Baby” or Lauren Hill’s cover of “Killing Me Softly.” Find an instance where the case went to court, review the judge’s decision, and write your own decision about what you think should have been the outcome of this conflict.

Economics- Learn about cases in which music groups (such as TLC) or artists (such as Elton John) with top-selling albums are forced to declare bankruptcy. Then write a “Financial Guide for New Recording Artists” that includes tips about how to enter into fair contracts, manage their money, and deal with financial hardship.

Geography- Research “home-grown” music genres from around the world. Choose a music genre from another country to present to your class. Dress up in costumes that reflect the culture that the music you chose represents, and bring in instruments unique to this genre. Perform excerpts from songs that exemplify the genre’s unique features.

Mathematics- Poll students in your school to find out about their music listening and purchasing habits. Compile your results in an article for your school’s newspaper.

Media Studies- Watch “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” Review the soundtrack of the film in terms of the following questions: How does the soundtrack enhance the film? Does the music ever detract from the plot of the film? Does the film rely too heavily on the soundtrack, too little, or is there just the right balance?
