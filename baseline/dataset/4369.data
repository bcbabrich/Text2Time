George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, does not have time before the election break to pass legislation on health care, welfare or campaign finance. But apparently he has plenty of time to push through an odious bill that would reward a few dairy farmers in his home state of Maine and five other northeastern states by jacking up milk prices for the urban poor and everyone else.

Under the proposed dairy bill, which is ready for a floor vote, Maine, Rhode Island, Vermont, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Connecticut would form a compact to drive milk prices higher in their states than Federal regulations require. Milk dealers located outside New England would be prohibited from selling milk in the region at a lower price. The bill would, in effect, impose a protective tariff on milk from other states.

The proposed dairy compact would amount to an assault on the living standards of poor families. By one estimate, the compact could raise retail milk prices by almost 30 percent. The compact also intrudes on interstate commerce and might well be found unconstitutional. It would encourage other states to erect similar protective walls -- to block, say, imports of low-cost manufactured goods from the South or wine from California.

By raising dairy prices in the Northeast, the dairy bill would encourage the region's dairy farmers to produce more milk, thereby adding to excess production that the Government is required to buy. And higher milk prices would raise the cost or reduce the benefits of Federal nutrition programs. The compact would subsidize northeastern milk dealers so that they would be able to sell their otherwise high-price milk outside the region -- a subsidy that would be tricky to implement in a way that is fair to dairy farmers outside the compact. Proponents say they can solve these problems, but proposed amendments are too loose to provide reassurance.
