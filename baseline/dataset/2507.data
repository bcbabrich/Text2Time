Shortly after Dr. Dawber became director of the project, the newly established National Heart Institute took over the study from the Public Health Service. With the goals of finding causes of heart disease and preventing it, the project "had kind of a confused dual mission, really without much direction and scientific purpose," Dr. Levy said.

Dr. Dawber and others realized that so little was known about heart disease that it would be much too early to look for prevention strategies. Instead, he focused on the more reachable goal, finding the causes.

Born in Duncan, British Columbia, in 1913, Thomas Royle Dawber graduated from Haverford College in Pennsylvania in 1933. He attended Harvard Medical School, completing his medical degree in 1937. He served in the Public Health Service before taking over the Framingham project.

He left it in 1966, in part because of budget cuts, and moved to Boston University, where he became chairman of preventive medicine. The heart institute, which had become the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, decided that the study had achieved its goals and that it could be shut down.

At Boston University, Dr. Dawber raised enough private money to keep the study going. As a steady stream of scientific papers from the study continued, the institute reversed its decision a few years later. The study now continues to follow not just the original participants, but also many of their children and grandchildren.

The research has generated more than 1,000 scientific papers, and many of the significant findings, like the connection between high blood pressure and strokes and the benefits of good cholesterol (H.D.L. or high density lipoprotein) were produced after the restoration of federal financing.

In addition to his daughter Nancy, of Naples, Fla., a son, John, of Needham, Mass., and two grandchildren survive.
