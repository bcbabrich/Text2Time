Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students share opinions about nutrition. They then compare the nutritional values of a snack product claiming health benefits with a candy product. Learning is synthesized by reflecting on the responsibility of companies, individuals and the government in determining whether a product lives up to its claims.



Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Share opinions about nutrition and discuss the foods they eat.

2. Learn about a new chocolate bar that purports to have significant health benefits by reading and discussing the article “An Apple a Day for Health? Mars Recommends Two Bars of Chocolate.”

3. Compare a product that purports to have health benefits with a traditional chocolate bar.

4. Write a reflection paper that addresses the issue of corporate, individual and government responsibility in determining what foods are truly healthy.

Resources / Materials:

-pens/pencils

-classroom board

-four large pieces of paper, each with one of the following statements written in large letters: “Strongly Agree,” “Agree Somewhat,” “Disagree Somewhat,” “Strongly Disagree”

-copies of the article “An Apple a Day for Health? Mars Recommends Two Bars of Chocolate,” found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20051101tuesday.html (one per student)

-resources for researching nutritional facts including textbooks, health journals, cookbooks and computers with internet access

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Before class, post the four statement posters (“Strongly Agree,” “Agree Somewhat,” “Disagree Somewhat,” and “Strongly Disagree”) in the corners of the classroom. Since students will be moving around to stand beneath the statements with which they most agree for different questions, be sure they have easy access to each corner. Read each of the statements below aloud and ask students to move to the corners of the room that best express their views on that subject. As students take their places, write the statement on the board. Then, ask at least one student in each group to share his or her opinion.

-Foods that taste good can’t be good for you.

-Food companies can be trusted to provide accurate information about the health benefits of their products.

-Foods that benefit one aspect of health may be detrimental to other aspects.

-Eating a well-balanced diet provides for all of your nutritional needs.

Ask students to what degree, if at all, nutritional value determines how they choose snack foods (chocolate, candy, chips, drinks, etc.)?

2. As a class, read and discuss the article “An Apple a Day for Health? Mars Recommends Two Bars of Chocolate” //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20051101tuesday.html, focusing on the following questions:

a. What product is Mars Inc. beginning to market?

b. What health claim does the company state about the product?

c. Why did they decide to add plant sterols to the product?

d. How many daily servings of the product does the company recommend?

e. Why do they believe that their product will be successful?

f. Why are some nutritionists skeptical about the product’s health claims?

g. How have the company’s competitors responded to the release of the product?

h. Who is Harold Schmitz and why does he say that he is troubled by the competitors’ claims?

i. How might the competitors’ claims affect the sales of CocoaVia?

j. Who funded the scientific research on the benefits of flavanol in dark chocolate?

k. What does Bonnie Liebman mean by her statement that the “marketing is getting ahead of the science?”

l. Why are flavanols typically stripped from chocolate?

m. How did Mars Inc. resolve that issue?

n. Why did the company’s advisory board set a calorie limit for the product, and what was the result?

o. In what other products can plant sterols be found, and why might they be considered healthier than CocoaVia?

3. Explain to the class that they will compare the nutritional value of a snack product on the market today that purports to have significant health benefits with a chocolate bar to determine the relative health benefits of each. To begin, divide the class into pairs and have each pair choose a product from the Health Bar and Chocolate Bar categories (some suggestions are listed below). To aid them in their research, provide students with the current daily nutritional guidelines (provided by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration at //www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/flg-7a.html). Students will work together to gather information and answer the questions for consideration (listed below and provided as a handout for easier student access):

HEALTH BARS

CocoaVia

Balance

Odwalla

Luna

Kudos

Nature Valley granola bar

PowerBar

SlimFast

CHOCOLATE BARS

Hershey’s milk chocolate bar

M&Ms

Nestle’s Crunch

Ghiradelli dark chocolate bar

Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup

Baby Ruth

Snickers

Three Musketeers

QUESTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION -What are the nutritional facts for each product (provided on the nutritional facts label)?

-What are the purported health benefits for each (if stated on the packaging)?

-How are the two products different and similar in terms of their nutritional content, calorie content, sugar content, etc.?

-How does each product measure up when judged against the current nutritional recommendations set by the Food and Drug Administration.

-According to the food label and nutritional recommendations, does the health bar seem to achieve its health claim?

-Are there other means of acquiring the health benefits promoted in the health product? If so, what are they?

-Based on the relative nutritional facts, the health claims and any other facts about the products, would you prefer to eat the health bar, the chocolate bar or a natural health product?

If possible, have students conduct a taste test of the two products and ask them to compare the taste as an additional factor to consider.

Toward the end of class, have students present their findings. For further discussion, ask them the following questions:

-Would you eat a product that claimed to be healthy even if it did not taste good?

-Is it reasonable for companies to claim that a product is healthy even if it includes ingredients that may not be beneficial to one’s health?

-What products do you currently consume that claim to have significant health benefits? Do you choose the product because of the health claim? If so, do you believe that you are acquiring the purported health benefits?

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: In the article, Bonnie Liebman states “the marketing is getting ahead of the science.” Write a reflection paper (1-2 pages) that responds to this statement and considers the following questions (written on the board before the end of class):

-What is the responsibility of a company in making a claim about health products based on sound scientific research?

-What is the responsibility of the consumer in investigating health claims made by health products and the companies that market them?

-What is the responsibility of the government in regulating what companies can claim in terms of health benefits to consumers?

Further Questions for Discussion:

-Why might candy and soft drink companies invest in products with purported health benefits?

-How might current trends in health and nutrition affect a company’s decision about the products they produce, and how they market them?

-What information do you look for when determining what foods to eat?

-To what degree do you consider the nutritional value of the foods you eat?

-To what degree might cost determine whether you choose a healthier but more expensive food product versus a less expensive but also less healthful one? Would you buy a healthier food if it cost more? At what point, if at all, might the cost outweigh the relative health benefits?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on participation in the opening exercise, thorough investigation of their products in the group work and thoughtful preparation of their reflection papers.

Vocabulary:

confections, quest, indulgence, wafts, antioxidant, additive, tribulations, siege, macro, skeptical, conferring, vascular, exploiting, prototype, engineering

Extension Activities:

1. Create a “How It Works” poster on the health benefits of flavanol. Where in nature is it found? What foods contain it naturally? Identify and compare a natural and a manufactured food that contain flavanol. How much of each would you need to eat daily in order to gain significant health benefits?

2. The article claims that heart disease is the number one killer in the world. What is heart disease? What genetic factors or behaviors contribute to heart disease? How is it diagnosed and treated? Does the disease affect a particular segment of the population (men, women, young, old, etc.) more than others? What dietary guidelines are recommended for the prevention of heart disease? What activities or behavior modifications are recommended for the prevention and treatment of the disease? Write a report of your findings.

3. Investigate health fads over the last century. To what degree did scientific reports affect the design, production and/or marketing of food products? Identify one health fad and write a critical analysis of its scientific basis, and the impact on the food industry and consumers. Do current reports on health support or debunk the health fad you investigated?

4. Compare the nutritional value of white chocolate, milk chocolate and dark chocolate based on the current nutritional recommendations. Create a chart of your findings.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Choose a U.S.-based chocolate company (Ghiradelli, Nestle, Hershey’s, Mars, etc.) to investigate. What products has it sold in its history? How, if at all, have the products changed or adapted to food trends? Do you have an idea for a new chocolate bar that might be a hit among your peer group and that reflects current thinking in nutrition? Write a letter to a chocolate company proposing your new product and how it might be marketed to today’s youth.

Civics- Why does the Federal Drug Administration require food products to list their nutritional contents? How does the agency determine daily nutritional values? How, if at all, does the agency regulate claims made by food companies? Are food companies required to consult with the FDA before claiming that a product is “healthy?” Write a research report of your findings.

Economics- The health food industry is a multi-billion dollar industry. What companies produce and market health products? What other products do they produce or market? Identify one health food product and investigate its parent company. What else does the parent company produce and/or market? When did the parent company start selling the product? Is any rationale given for why it began to produce and/or market the product at that time? What was the annual revenue for the product for the first year in the market? What are its current revenues? Produce a market analysis of the product’s success in the market relative to the company’s other products.

Media Studies- Imagine that an ingredient in your favorite snack food was just reported to have significant health benefits. Like CocoaVia, the product might also include some ingredients that are not necessarily “healthy.” How would you market this product? How, if at all, would you balance promoting the health benefits and providing information (or warnings) about the possible negative effects of the product? In creating your campaign, identify your target audience. Develop a campaign designed to reach the target group in terms of both the information you provide and the way in which you communicate your message.

Teaching with The Times – Read the Health section of The Times every week for one month and clip articles that report on nutrition. Do the reports offer recommendations designed to alter current dietary habits or that support existing recommendations? Do the reports reflect your own dietary habits? If not, how, if at all, does the information provided in the reports reflect and/or impact your own dietary habits? At the end of the month, write a reflection that summarizes how your diet compares with the findings and/or recommendations in the articles, and whether any of the reports have changed the foods you buy or the way you eat.
