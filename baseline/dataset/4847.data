NBC executives yesterday denied charges that they had caved into advertiser fear of homosexual themes in deciding to withhold backing for a proposed episode of the drama series "Quantum Leap" that was to deal with a gay teen-ager contemplating suicide.

Perry Simon, the executive vice president of prime-time programs for NBC, said the network had considered the issue of possible advertiser resistance to the episode, but was mainly reluctant to commit to paying for the program out of legimate concerns about its content and the way it had been presented to the network.

Mr. Simon said NBC was never consulted about the episode's story line before it was put into production. Such consultation is the normal process for every episode of a television series and especially one likely to be controversial, he said.

The executive producer of "Quantum Leap," Donald P. Bellisario, said that NBC had known for months the story line of his project. He blamed the advertising industry for the conflict, saying NBC feared the show would not be sponsored and would lose up to $1 million. He said that NBC suggested at a meeting last week that the show's production company, Universal Television, would have to make up for some of the financial shortfall if the show did not attract enough advertising.
