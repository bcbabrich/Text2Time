PUEBLO, Colo. – Senator Barack Obama ridiculed the endorsement that Vice President Dick Cheney extended to Senator John McCain on Saturday, asking voters here whether they believed that was a sign that Mr. McCain would take the nation in a new direction.

“Do you think Dick Cheney is delighted to support John McCain because he thinks John McCain’s going to bring change?” Mr. Obama said. “Do you think John McCain and Dick Cheney have been talking about how to shake things up, put Halliburton and get rid of the lobbyists and the old boys club in Washington?”

Mr. Obama seized upon remarks that the vice president delivered at a Republican campaign event on Saturday in Wyoming, where Mr. Cheney offered a forceful argument for Mr. McCain’s candidacy, saying: “John is a man who understands the danger facing America, he’s a man who has looked into the face of evil and not flinched.”

For months, Mr. Obama has been seeking to link Mr. McCain to the Bush administration. The comments from Mr. Cheney offered a fresh rationale for Mr. Obama, which he pitched to Colorado voters in the second stop on a three-state that began in Nevada and ended in Missouri.

“I’d like to congratulate Senator McCain on this endorsement because he really earned it. That endorsement didn’t come easy. Senator McCain had to vote 90 percent of the time with George Bush and Dick Cheney to get it,” Mr. Obama said. “He served as Washington’s biggest cheerleader for going to war in Iraq, and supports economic policies that are no different from the last eight years.”

For Mr. McCain, who has been working to distance himself from the administration, the endorsement presented an awkward moment.

A spokesman for the McCain campaign issued a statement responding to Mr. Obama’s remarks, reminding voters that it was Mr. McCain who had opposed the Bush administration’s energy policy. Mr. Obama supported it.

“Barack Obama and Dick Cheney aren’t just cousins, they’ve shared support for the Bush energy policy and the out-of-control spending that John McCain has fought to oppose,” said Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for the McCain campaign.
