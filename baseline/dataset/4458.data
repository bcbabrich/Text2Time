As expected, two executives at Doremus & Company in New York have formed their own agency with a creative focus. In a surprise, however, a third partner in the new shop, which will be part of the Omnicom Group, is coming from outside the agency.

Parry Merkley, president, and Stephen Harty, executive vice president and director of client services at Doremus, have teamed with Jane D. Newman, vice chairman worldwide and head of account planning at Chiat/Day in New York, to open the latest Omnicom unit, Merkley Newman Harty, effective Monday.

The new shop, with 40 employees, will open with billings estimated at $40 million from a base of Doremus's traditional financial corporate and consumer clients, including Forbes, Casio, Bankers Trust and Word Perfect.

"We are not pining for the glory days of advertising that will never return," Mr. Merkley said in a telephone interview yesterday. "It is a different world now, and it is essential to us that we are completely involved in the clients' business goals, not just the advertising goals."
