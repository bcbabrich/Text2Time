WASHINGTON, July 1—Milton Toyebo, a 70‐year‐old Kiowa Indian from southwestem Oklahoma, sat on a wooden chair under a canopy of leafy branches this morning not far from the Washington Monument and whittled an arrow shaft with an old pocket knife.

Mr. Toyebo was one of more than 250 persons from Arkansas, Oklahoma and other areas where pockets of American folk culture survive who gathered today for the opening of the Smithsonian Institution's five‐day Festival of American Folk Life.

The Smithsonian, which paid the transportation and room costs for the participants, staged its fourth annual festival on the mall near the Museum of Natural History.

Thousands of visitors jammed the shady mall this morning in 90‐degree temperatures to see handicrafts and hints of life styles that they may have learned about previously only in films or books.
