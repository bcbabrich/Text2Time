Massachusetts, which like so many states has overcrowded jails, plans to issue $70 million in taxable municipal bonds to construct a prison in Plymouth County, near Boston. Dillon, Read & Company, the underwriter for the negotiated deal, expects the issue to be marketed sometime in September or October.

Richard A. Skerry, general counsel for the Massachusetts Industrial Finance Authority, said yesterday that the plans at first called for a 440-bed unit to be privately operated. There has been a trend around the nation for states to ask private organizations to build and operate jails, with the state paying a daily rate for each prisoner.

"Then it was decided to expand the size to 1,140 beds and to have the Sheriff of Plymouth County operate it," Mr. Skerry said, explaining that the new jail would be used by Federal marshals, by state law-enforcement authorities and by Plymouth County in an unusual triple arrangement.
