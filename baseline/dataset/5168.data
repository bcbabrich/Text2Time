Clearly, most citizens and their political leaders continue to impute powers to nuclear weapons well beyond their vast destructive potential. American and Soviet officials now visit once-secret military installations, but nuclear weapons continue to be treated with special deference, as if these state secrets were among the most sacred held by powerful societies. More than any other observer, Robert Jervis, a professor of political science at Columbia University, has explored the symbolic and psychological aspects of nuclear strategy. ''The Meaning of the Nuclear Revolution,'' a collection of new and revised essays, demonstrates the utility of connecting nuclear theology to social psychology and history.

Mr. Jervis's thesis is that nuclear weapons have unalterably changed the way people think and the way nations behave. Given these weapons of mass destruction, he argues, victory is no longer possible in superpower confrontations, and large-scale violence is no longer a useful tool of statecraft: ''It is the prospect of fighting the war rather than the possibility of losing it that induces restraint.'' In Mr. Jervis's view, this basic psychological condition, rather than highly diversified nuclear options, constitutes the essence of deterrence.

Because of the horrendous consequences of any nuclear confrontation, Mr. Jervis believes these weapons have not only made war less likely, they have also made major crises between great powers an infrequent occurrence. Aside from the nerve-racking period between 1958 and 1962, when the superpowers engaged in high-stakes confrontations over Berlin and Cuba, American and Russian leaders have acted with considerable restraint. Significantly, the last such confrontation happened 16 years ago, during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. An intriguing question Mr. Jervis does not address here is the degree to which the personalities of American and Soviet leaders have contributed to nuclear crises.

Since nuclear weapons promote caution, Mr. Jervis contends, they have served to reinforce the status quo, especially in terms of alliance relations. Recent controversies within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization over nuclear modernization seem to argue otherwise, but Mr. Jervis argues convincingly that superpower nuclear arsenals have provided more glue than solvent to alliance relationships. Historically, major shifts in territory and spheres of influence usually occur through conflict or through threats of war, and nuclear weapons have reduced both. These weapons also place a heavy onus on the superpower that wishes to change the status quo. When full-blown crises have erupted or when the superpowers have jockeyed for advantage over lesser stakes, Mr. Jervis concludes, political outcomes have been unrelated to the nuclear balance or perceptions of it.

This book is a testament to changing nuclear fashions. The ''victory is possible'' school of strategic analysis, which appears to have prompted several of these essays, has been quieted by the surprising developments of the past three years. Now that Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev have jointly declared that a nuclear war must never be fought and can never be won, most of Mr. Jervis's conclusions will not provoke a spirited argument. Instead, a new set of questions has risen to the fore that the author does not address. What are the psychological and strategic implications when one of the superpowers systematically attempts to devalue nuclear weapons, as the Kremlin is now doing? How does ''the absence of peaceful change on issues of most concern to the superpowers'' - one hallmark of Mr. Jervis's nuclear revolution - square with events now unfolding in the Warsaw Pact nations? And how do Mr. Jervis's findings relate to states that are not superpowers?
