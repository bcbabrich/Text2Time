The Devils are off to the best start in the 13-year history of the franchise, and their success is underlined by the performance of their main line: Kirk Muller as center for Aaron Broten on the left and Pat Verbeek on the right.

Ten games into the National Hockey League season, the line has been as balanced as it is effective. Each player has 17 points, with Verbeek leading the way in goals with 10 and Broten in assists with 13. Muller has eight goals and nine assists.

Coach Doug Carpenter has experimented with his lines this season in looking for the right combinations, but he has left this line intact from the preseason.

The three formed the line with success in the late stages of last season, and Carpenter made sacrifices to keep them together for this season. It has paid off well for the Devils because all three are off to the best starts of their careers.
