But it wasn't the Smith failures that give the Yankees pause. It is the littany of their own near-misses and blown opportunities. So even while fretting about the starting pitching, they continued to search for alternatives to their bullpen woes. Last night, a 6 foot 6 inch, 270-pound one landed in their lap.

So Big Lee Smith -- that's his unofficial monicker -- comes to the home of Rich Gossage and Sparky Lyle. Complete with 98-mile-an-hour fastball and the ability to strike someone, anyone out.

Showalter also hopes for something more intangible. For he is a manager who looks to the force within players. And he what he knows of Smith is this. The right-hander is as physically imposing as Gossage, but he's also known to be as bulldoggish as Jeff Reardon, as durable as Rollie Fingers.

Smith has never shirked an assignment, even on days when his ailing knees made it almost impossible to climb the dugout steps at Wrigley Field during his days with the Cubs. And he has never alibied after a failure. Not even when he yielded that now-famous home run to Steve Garvey in the 1984 National League playoffs, a shot that allowed the San Diego Padres to eventually crush the World Series dreams held by long-suffering Cubs fans.

It is the combination of the man and the pitcher, the reputation and the record, which intrigue Showalter. The manager, who counts on head and heart and belly as much as New York's other manager, said as much before last night's 11-3 loss. Personality, presence counts, said the manager. Besides, joked Showalter, the Yankees might have to mix it up with a couple teams down the stretch in a physical strength. "I'd like to have a guy like Lee Smith out there in front," he laughed.

That physical presence wasn't there every time out for St. Louis this season. Cardinals Manager Joe Torre probably wished he could keep the heart but jettison a couple years; those 12 blown saves made such a big difference for the now-fading Cardinals. But what wound up a mixed bag of disappointment and success in St. Louis looks overwhelmingly good to the Yankees. It couldn't help but, considering where the Yankees have been.

To date, the entire Yankees' bullpen saved only 35, eight shy of Smith's totals. The best the Yankees had to offer, Steve Farr, has been more of a question than an answer, saving 25 but blowing six.
