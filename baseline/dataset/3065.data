Re ''Planning Lincoln Center Anew'' (editorial, Jan. 29):

Why does a complex of beautiful buildings have to be ''reborn'' because it is about 50 years old?

As a frequent visitor to all of the artistic venues that form Lincoln Center, I am thrilled every time that I walk by the grand plaza with its fountain and every time I enjoy the high artistic level of the performances.

The buildings may have their shortcomings, but these are dwarfed by the aesthetics and culture enjoyed by tourists and New Yorkers alike.

Couldn't the $1.5 billion be used for many more deserving causes?
