Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes- 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Discuss their opinions about issues related to the education of girls.

2. Learn about the divide created in Afghan society over the education of girls by reading and discussing the article “Attacks on Schools for Girls Hint at Lingering Split in Afghanistan.”

3. In groups, prepare speeches about girls’ education in Afghanistan; hold a class forum on the subject.

4. Write an analysis and proposal about girls’ education in Afghanistan.

Resources / Materials:

-newspapers (one per group)

-pens/pencils

-paper

-classroom board

-copies of the article “Attacks on Schools for Girls Hint at Lingering Split in Afghanistan” (one per student)

-four large pieces of paper, each with one of the following statements written in large letters: “Strongly Agree,” “Agree Somewhat,” “Disagree Somewhat,” “Strongly Disagree”

Activities / Procedures:

NOTE TO TEACHERS: Before class, hang the four “statement” posters in different corners of the room. Because students will be moving around to stand beneath the statements with which they most agree for different questions related to the education of women, be sure that students have clear paths in the room to reach all four corners.

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Explain to students that they will be expressing their views on different statements that you will be reading to them regarding the education of women. Point out that each corner of the room has a sign that states to what degree students agree or disagree with a statement. For each of the statements below, read the statement aloud and allow students to move to the corners of the room that best express their views on the statement. As students take their places, write the statement on the board. Then, ask at least one student in each group to share his or her choice.

–Women should have access to the public education system.

–Males and females should attend the same schools.

–The United States should implement a system for the education of females in countries where there is none.

–Such a system should be implemented even in the face of opposition from natives of that country. After each statement, ask students to explain why they chose to stand where they did.

2. As a class, read the article “Attacks on Schools for Girls Hint at Lingering Split in Afghanistan” focusing on the following questions:

a. What was discovered in Karim Dad? What does it say?

b. What events coincided with the discovery of this object?

c. What other hints to the opposition of female education have taken place?

d. How are the students of these schools responding?

e. What act, according to the letter, stripped Afghan women of their dignity?

f. According to Muhammad Aslam Amiri, why are schools for girls important?

3. Divide the class into groups, with each group representing one of the following: United States foreign policy makers in charge of implementing the new Afghan schools, students attending the new schools, a conservative group of ethnic Pashtuns, representatives of an Islamic fundamentalist group, and representatives of the new Afghan government. In groups, students discuss their position on the new girls’ schools. Each group prepares a two minute speech outlining its position. The speech should focus on the following issues related to the education of Afghan women:

–What are the benefits and/or drawbacks of Afghanistan’s new girl’s schools on the students? On the country as a whole?

–What is your position on the subjects being taught at the new girls’ schools (if you oppose, might you consider a different type of school with alternative subject matter)?

–How do you feel about United States involvement in deciding if and how girls should be educated in Afghanistan? Do you think that this change (or a similar one) would happen naturally if the United States was not involved?

–What does your religion or culture say about the education of women? If you are against the new Afghan education system, would there be a preferable one that would satisfy your religious or cultural agenda?

After groups prepare their speeches, stage a class forum on the issue of girls’ education in Afghanistan. Each group presents its speech in turn, allowing for a question and answer period after each speech. The goal of the forum is to establish common ground and attempt to provide compromises that might meet each group’s needs better (as opposed to a debate in which one side attempts to “win.”) Groups should be encouraged to ask questions for clarification and to make suggestions based on other groups’ comments.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: At home, students write a critical analysis of the issues involved in the current situation (based on the class discussion) and a proposal for an alternative structure for girls’ education in Afghanistan that represents a compromise between the different interest groups involved in the issue. Students should explain how this structure would benefit the parties involved.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–Do you think that the people responsible for the attacks felt they were doing the right thing? How can both sides think that they are right?

–Would you attend school if you were a girl living in Afghanistan now? Why or why not?

–What do you think is the purpose of education, or are there many possible purposes?

–Do you think that everyone has the right to education (consider various groups to whom education is sometimes denied, including minorities, women, prisoners, or the mentally ill)?

–Do you think that progressivism should always win out over conservatism? In practice, which of these viewpoints do you think usually prevails?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated on participation in Warm-up activity, participation in class discussion, participation in group preparation, participation in class forum, and completion of analysis and proposal.

Vocabulary:

remnants, anonymous, infidel, doctrinaire, detonated, perpetrators, waiflike, dictatorial

Extension Activities:

1. Learn about the education of women throughout the world. Create a poster illustrating the different types of female education that are common in countries with different types of governments, religious affiliations, and cultures, such as Cuba, China, and Canada. Also consider and report on statistics related to education, such as literacy rates, average length of education, and average income.

2. Learn about the historical development of the Bais Yaakov system of schools for Jewish girls. Write an essay that answers the following questions: How and why did these schools develop? What type of education was available for orthodox Jewish girls before Bais Yaakov? What affect did these schools have on the lives of orthodox Jewish women? How do these schools function today?

3. Write a letter in response to those left at the sites of the school attacks. The letter should express the students’ opinions about the schools themselves and the action taken by “Mujahadeen of Afghanistan.”

4. Go to (//www.oprah.com/) to learn about the case of Amina Lawal, a 30-year-old Nigerian woman sentenced to stoning for committing adultery. Then write your own letter, modeled after the Amnesty International form letter on the site, explaining your feelings and suggesting what you think should be done about this case.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Create a timeline tracing the way that education has changed in the United States over the last two centuries. Focus on the development of education specifically as it pertains to minorities and women. Include legislation and monumental events (protests, establishment of new schools, firsts, etc) on your timeline. Some key terms to address include: separate but equal, school vouchers, coeducational schools, and women’s colleges.

Current Events- Learn about the debate in New York City over the creation of all boys’ public schools. Interview people who have gone to single sex schools as well as teachers and administrators of such schools to learn about how they are run, the philosophy behind them, and how people feel about them. Also consider the philosophy behind public education (especially the controversial concept of separate but equal). Then write an opinion paper expressing your views on whether they should create single sex public schools.

Health- Learn about the different developmental stages of boys and girls from birth to age 18. Create a chart comparing these stages. Then, next to each stage, suggest possible educational models and techniques that would be best suited to each stage for both sexes. Then write a short analysis addressing the following questions: Does it seem that boys and girls can benefit from different types of education? When do the models or techniques overlap? How can the best interest of both sexes be met in a coeducational setting?

Media Studies- Watch a movie that focuses on a woman’s struggle between traditional and progressive cultures, such as “Yentel,” “Mississippi Masala,” or “Gone With the Wind.” After watching the movie, write a series of diary entries, imagining that you are one of these characters. Reflect on how the clash between these cultures effects your life and your choices. First, write two entries that take place during the events of the film, and then write two that take place afterward (imagining the events that might have followed from those in the film).
