Sebastian Coe has endured trying moments in the job of leading London's bid for the 2012 Olympics, with its public relations tempests and punishing travel schedule, but none quite so trying as the day of his mother's funeral. As hard as it was to mourn her death, he immediately bade his family goodbye and left for a 23-hour plane trip to Australia to help pitch London's bid to a gathering of International Olympic Committee members in early April.

Exhausted emotionally and physically, Coe walked into the lobby of his hotel in Brisbane, and the first person he saw was the NYC2012 founder, Daniel L. Doctoroff. They sat together for 15 minutes, stealing a break in their frenzied schedules simply to empathize.

"He was very understanding; he had lost a parent recently, too," Coe said in a telephone interview from London last week. "It was a great display of humanity."

The five men leading the bids for the 2012 Olympic finalist cities are an unusual peer group, sharing what has become a grueling job, only one of which will end happily when the I.O.C. picks the 2012 city on July 6. The task of selling 117 I.O.C. members on their city falls largely on these five men.
