No one took responsibility.

Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said the blast had been caused by a bomb containing about five ounces of TNT.

''The first thing that comes to mind is the situation in Dagestan,'' Mr. Luzhkov said. ''But a more serious examination is needed to make an accusation. Tonight we shall find out what kind of bomb it was.''

Near the Kremlin and Red Square, the Manezh is a favorite hangout for young Muscovites, who go there to socialize, window-shop and eat at its fast-food restaurants.

The blast took place at 7:59 P.M., ripping apart a video arcade. Blood was smeared across the floor of a McDonald's.

Of the 30 people who were wounded, five are in grave condition.

The blast came during a new wave of fighting in Dagestan. Today the Russian military attacked two villages close to the capital, Makhachkala. The attacks took place barely a week after Moscow declared that it had triumphed over Islamic militants who had crossed into Dagestan from Chechnya.
