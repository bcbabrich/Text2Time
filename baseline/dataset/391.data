Francis Alÿs: A Story of Negotiation

MALBA

Through Feb. 15.

The Mexico-based artist Alÿs’s multimedia artworks blend social commentary with a sense of the absurd. In his film “Reel-Unreel,” a child rolls a reel of film through the streets of Kabul, Afghanistan.

A Centennial Exhibition: INOUE Yuichi

21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art

Jan. 2-March 21.

In the years after World War II, the artist Inoue Yuichi (1916-1985) made a name for himself in Japan by pioneering a new style of calligraphy that blended the principles of European abstraction with the traditions of the Japanese handwriting technique. This exhibition surveys the artist’s works, some completely abstract, others that depicted subjects like animals, and still others that tackled topics like the violence inflicted on Tokyo during the war.

The Mark of Malevich: Graphics from the State Tretyakov Gallery’s Collection

Tretyakov Gallery on Krymsky Val

Through Feb. 14.

Almost exactly 100 years ago, Kazimir Malevich unveiled his “Black Suprematist Square,” an all-black painting that became the hallmark of the Russian avant garde. This exhibition marks the centenary of the painting and the Suprematist art movement, which it helped spawn. Late last year, the museum announced that researchers had discovered an inscription under the paint on Malevich’s black square — a satirical reference, they believe, to a painting by a 19th century French artist.

Carlo Portelli: Pittore eccentrico tra Rosso Fiorentino e Vasari

Galleria dell’Accademia

Through April 30.

The 16th century Florentine artist’s work features in some prominent collections — including the Galleria, where one of his altarpieces is on display alongside Michelangelo’s David. His name remains somewhat obscure. This exhibition brings together a wide swath of his artwork, which combines Christian and pagan themes. Some of the artist’s work harks back to early Renaissance styles, while others have the stylized look of his contemporary, Michelangelo.

Pelléas et Mélisande

Barbican Center

Jan. 9 and 10.

The conductor Simon Rattle, who will take up the mantle of music director of the orchestra in 2017, will take the podium on Jan. 9 and 10 to lead a semistaged version of Debussy’s opera “Pelléas et Mélisande,” directed by the iconoclastic theater director Peter Sellars. The show kicks off a new collaboration between the duo, who plan to stage a work together each year.

Jean-Etienne Liotard

Royal Academy

Through Jan. 31.

The star of the Swiss painter Liotard (1702-89) rose quickly in Europe in the 18th century. He had prominent commissions from many of the Continent’s royals, including Marie Antoinette. He also had a strong interest in the east, and traveled to Istanbul, training his eye on unusual subjects for an artist of his era, like dwarves and Ottoman musicians. This exhibition showcases his portraits, still lifes and sketches.

Lurid Beauty: Australian Surrealism and its Echoes

NGV Australia

Through Jan. 31.

In the 1930s, the Surrealist art movement, which emerged in Europe just after World War I, began to gain steam in Australia. This exhibition showcases the young Australian artists involved in the movement, like Albert Tucker and Max Dupain. It also shows work by some of their later heirs, like Sidney Nolan, who made paintings in the vein of Salvador Dalí; and Leigh Bowery, whose work included video pieces, photographs and interviews in which he dressed as an androgynous clown.
