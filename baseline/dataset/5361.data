Texaco Inc. today agreed to plead guilty to Federal felony charges and pay a $750,000 fine in a case stemming from a failure to test safety equipment on an offshore oil rig.

The company's Texaco USA subsidiary was charged, along with a former oil rig supervisor and a drilling contractor, with delaying for two days a required weekly test of a device that prevents blowouts of pressurized natural gas during drilling.

It is the first criminal prosecution under provisions of the offshore drilling act that took effect in 1978, said Janet Goldstein, an Assistant United States Attorney who is a member of the Justice Department's environmental crime section and who is prosecuting the case.

No accident or other damage took place because of the testing delays at the company's Platform Harvest off the California coast in December 1986, Texaco said.
