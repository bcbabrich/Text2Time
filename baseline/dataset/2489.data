An 85-year-old man was found dead in his apartment in Parkchester, the Bronx, yesterday morning in what the authorities said might have been a case of carbon monoxide poisoning.

The man, identified as James A. Atkinson, was found dead at 10:49 a.m. in his sixth-floor apartment at 2051 St. Raymond Avenue, where he may have died as many as two days earlier, the Fire Department said. Two residents on the floor above him were taken to Bronx Municipal Hospital for carbon monoxide inhalation, the Fire Department said. Their conditions were not released yesterday.

The medical examiner's office will determine the cause of Mr. Atkinson's death, the police said.

Mr. Atkinson was a retired postal worker who had worked in Harlem. Neighbors said Mr. Atkinson was a kind man who ate pancakes and sausage at a nearby Burger King every morning, and was known for being impeccably dressed, but that he frequently complained of being cold in his apartment, and was known to boil water to try to make it warmer.

The Fire Department said the carbon monoxide levels in the apartment were far above safe levels. A sign on the building, posted by the management, Parkchester South Condominiums, said it was exempt from a law ordering carbon monoxide detectors because the heat was piped in from another building. Carol Abrams, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said the case was under investigation. Officials and neighbors said a gas stove might have been the source of the fumes.
