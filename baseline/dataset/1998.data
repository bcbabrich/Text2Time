Just when the pressure is building on both sides, or all sides, over resolutions in the Senate that generally oppose President Bush’s plan to increase troop levels in Iraq by 21,500, the White House invokes Osama bin Laden.

The White House press secretary, Tony Snow, was asked today about Senator John Warner’s compromise resolution, and deputy press secretary Dana Perino’s comments on Wednesday that these things send mixed messages to the troops and to the “enemy.’’ Here’s what he had to say:

As you know, and I’ve said many times, Osama bin Laden thought the lack of American resolve was a key reason why he could inspire people to come after us on September 11th. I am not accusing members of the Senate of inviting carnage on the United States of America. I’m simply saying, you think about what impact it may have. But we also — look, they’re a separate and co-equal branch of government. And they will do what they think is appropriate. …

Well, it’s a busy day in the Senate. Our chief congressional correspondent, Carl Hulse, just filed this update, as some senators sign on in support of Senator Warner’s revised resolution, while some staunch opponents of the war in Iraq, call it endorsing the “status quo.’’



It’s still unclear how many Republican senators will join Mr. Warner, or whether the opposition is stiffening among G.O.P lawmakers to any effort to oppose the president.

This morning, Senator John McCain adopted a scathing tone toward Gen. George W. Casey Jr., who had recommended that only two brigades, not five, were needed to quell the violence in Iraq. Despite that, General Casey said he generally supported Mr. Bush’s plan for more troops. The comments were made at the hearing on General Casey’s nomination as the Army’s chief of staff.

There’s a lot of political maneuvering in the Senate over Mr. Warner’s revised resolution, as we said. And there will be attempts to filibuster, it seems, to head this debate off until at least Monday. Sixty votes are needed to block a filibuster — meaning 10 or 11 Republicans supporting Mr. Warner.

Until then, outside groups on all sides are weighing in. MoveOn.org has called this a virtual action day, and claims it has inundated senators’ offices with calls to oppose what it and other opponents of the war term an “escalation’’ of the war. Conservative columnist Hugh Hewitt, meanwhile, continues to collect pledge signatures, as we told you last week, from thousands of readers who promise to deny campaign contributions to any senator joining with Democrats in any resolution that opposes the troop increase.

Now, President Bush, while saying he understood that Americans are worried about the current situation in Iraq, has always insisted that he doesn’t pay attention to polls, which of course these days show a very low rating of approval for how he’s managing the war and concern for his latest strategy.

But you wouldn’t know that polls aren’t taken into account in the minds of the Bush administration by Mr. Snow’s comments today.

Here’s another bit of q&A:

Q: But there’s still a realization that if his request was for patience and allow this to work, the answer, at least where public opinion is today and where congressional opinion is — if we get this resolution, is, we don’t trust you to carry it out. Mr. Snow: I’m not sure that’s right. I’d take a look — well, well, based – Q: You can make an argument, but I mean based on what? What would you — Mr. Snow: Based on — for instance, if you take a look at when people got a chance to listen to him at the State of the Union address. You’ve seen the flash polls, and they indicated the people did think, okay, we get it. I think that there is still a basis for the public wanting to see success in Iraq. I think to the extent that the public doesn’t like what’s going on, we agree with them. And as I would suggest again, facts on the ground are going to shape opinion. We know that. The President has an obligation as Commander-in-Chief to do what he thinks is necessary to keep this country safe. Q: Just one final one on this. You make assertions about the public gets it, the public wants this based on I don’t know what — Mr. Snow: No, I mean, we’ve done — Q And what I’m — the question is, do you think the American people and Congress trust the President to fix what’s wrong in Iraq? Mr. Snow: I think the American people want to see results. I think — I don’t know how you say — let me explain why I think trust is a little loaded. The President is a man of his word, and he’s a man of honor. And trust is often associated with that. Do Americans have absolute confidence that what we have laid out is going to have 100 percent chance of success? No, they want to see results. So I think the reason I’m reluctant to answer the trust question is that that bears on character. And I think people do, in fact, trust the President’s character.

Mr. Bush meets with Republicans on Friday and with Democrats on Saturday. Topic A will surely be defense of his plan.

Who rules on the way forward right now is anyone’s guess. The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, supports the president’s plan, but posits a timeline of six to eight months, or nine, to gauge whether it can be successful.

Where will bin Laden be then?
