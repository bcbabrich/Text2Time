The Supreme Court settled one of the country's longer-running boundary disputes today by ruling unanimously that a seven-mile stretch of river frontage on the Mississippi River's Louisiana bank actually belongs to Mississippi.

In awarding the uninhabited property known as Stack Island, near Lake Providence, La., to the state across the river, the Court acted within its "original jurisdiction," its authority under the Constitution to sit as a trial court and resolve disputes between states. The Court applied principles of boundary adjudication it has developed over years of hearing such cases.

The land, which is under water part of the year, is used mainly for hunting by a Mississippi family that claims ownership based on a Federal deed from 1888. Louisiana, which filed suit in the Supreme Court in 1993, told the Court the land had "great value" for hunting, fishing, timber and recreation, as well as "the potential for the production of oil, gas and other minerals."

As it nearly always does in these disputes, the Court had referred the case of Louisiana v. Mississippi to a special master for factual findings and recommendations. The master, Vincent L. McKusick, a former Chief Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine, visited the site twice last year -- by boat in May, when the area was largely submerged during the river's seasonal high level and by car in September.
