Re "Russia Unchains a Ghost: Stalin, the Wartime Hero" (Week in Review, April 23):

It is astonishing to read of the efforts being made in Russia to rehabilitate Stalin as Soviet leader in World War II, in view of the extent to which his cynical, bungling policies contributed to the wartime suffering of the Soviet people.

Britain and France went to war in defense of Poland in 1939, when the Soviet Union was allied with Nazi Germany. Stalin was scrupulously loyal to his Nazi ally, shipping large quantities of raw materials and foodstuffs to Germany and even going so far as to deliver up scores of German Communist exiles to certain death at the hands of the Nazis.

American Communists were instructed to oppose aid to Britain, and Communists in the French Army during the "Phony War" of 1939-40 did everything possible to undermine morale.

Assuming that Hitler's good faith would match his own, Stalin was caught completely by surprise when the Germans attacked in June 1941. The Red Army simply collapsed along the entire front, suffering millions of casualties. Stalin dropped from sight for several weeks and is generally believed to have had a nervous collapse.
