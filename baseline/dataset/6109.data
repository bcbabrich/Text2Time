WASLIINGTON, Oct. 1 (AP) —; The senate has passed a bill that could mean prison terms of up to five years for doctors and nursing home operators who were convicted of fraud in dealing with Medicare or Medicaid patients.

The bill, passed by voice vote and sent to a Senate‐House conference committee, follows months of hearings and investigations by a Senate Finance subcommittee into abuse of the two big Government medical programs.

Medicare is the Federal program of aid to the elderly. The state‐Federal Medicaid program aids the needy.

The subcommittee found that current penalties of up to six months in jail for medical service providers who cheat “have not proved adequate deterrents.” As a result, the Senate‐passed bill would classify most such violations as felonies and raise the maximum penalty to five years in prison and $25,000 fine.
