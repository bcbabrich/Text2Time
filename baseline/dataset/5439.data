The specialties of Pizzeria Las Americas, 40-05 Junction Boulevard (Roosevelt Avenue), Corona, Queens, are neither the typical kinds of pizza nor the latest designer styles. They are pizzas with a Hispanic flavor.

The sausage pizza is made with chorizo, for example. Another is made with ham and pimento, and the spicy eggplant pizza comes with a layer of ham. The only variety not made with either ham or chorizo is the onion pizza, which does not contain tomato either. A two-crust pizza gallega, great to take on a picnic, is filled with onions, peppers and chorizo.

The simple storefront, with tables in the rear, also sells empanadas of chicken, meat or tuna.

Pizza prices range from $7.90 to $11.80 for whole pies, or $1 to $1.50 a slice. Empanadas are $1 and $1.10 each. Pizzeria Las Americas is open daily from 11:30 A.M. to 11 P.M.; 718-478-5040. Adult Peanut Butter

Adults - among them William F. Buckley Jr., Malcolm Forbes and Julia Child - are often caught with their fingers in the peanut butter jar. For such people the Peanut Advisory Board has published the ''Adults Only Peanut Butter Lovers Official Cooking Handbook.''

The booklet has nine recipes for cookies and one for ice cream, and can be obtained by sending a stamped, self-addressed business-size envelope to Peanut Butter Cookies, Peanut Advisory Board, P.O. Box 7528, Tifton, Ga. 31793.

Here is the recipe for peanut butter shortbread, to try while waiting for the booklet:

Combine half a cup of softened unsalted butter, half a cup of granulated sugar, a quarter of a cup of creamy peanut butter and two cups of all-purpose flour in a bowl, mixing the ingredients with your fingertips until they become crumbly, like coarse meal. Press the mixture into an ungreased eight- or nine-inch round cake pan and with a fork prick lines in the dough to mark wedges.

Bake at 300 degrees about an hour, until very lightly browned. Cut into wedges when still warm, but allow to cool completely before removing from the pan. Once cool, the wedges can be embellished by glazing the tops with a melted three-ounce bar of semisweet chocolate. Painless Caramel
