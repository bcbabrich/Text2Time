All right, the eulogies for Richard M. Nixon are over and a great American is buried. But let's not misrepresent the true Nixon gestalt, which encompassed not only the grand mastery and malpractice of politics but also some excursions into absurdity. Here was a President of many paradoxes, not least of which was his ability (shared by his staff) to seem at once rigidly on top of things and woefully out of touch.

The classic example may be Mr. Nixon's brief meeting at the White House with Elvis Presley on Dec. 21, 1970, three and a half years before the President's resignation over Watergate and six and a half years before the singer's death amid prescription-drug abuse and self-indulgence. The famous photograph of that encounter -- two men destined for different types of self-destruction -- has become an icon of both the President and the King. More illuminating is the record of the meeting, which has been in the public domain since 1986 (unlike many White House records whose release Mr. Nixon successfully fought in court) and is now housed at the Nixon Presidential Materials Project of the National Archives in College Park, Md. Here are excerpts. TOM KUNTZ Mailing It Special 'D'

Elvis personally delivered a letter seeking a meeting with the President to a White House guard on the morning of the encounter. In Presley's hand, it was written on his flight to Washington, to judge from the airline stationery used. His intention was to add to his collection of law-enforcement paraphernalia by obtaining the credentials of a Federal agent in the war on drugs (and he was rebuffed in this quest on a visit to the Narcotics Bureau, the columnist Jack Anderson later reported): Dear Mr. President:

First, I would like to introduce myself. I am Elvis Presley and admire you and have Great Respect for your office. I talked to Vice President Agnew in Palm Springs three weeks ago and expressed my concern for our country. The Drug Culture, the Hippie Elements, the S.D.S. [ Students for a Democratic Society ] , Black Panthers, etc. do not consider me as their enemy or as they call it the Establishment. I call it America and I love it. . . . I have no concerns or motives other than helping the country out. So I wish not to be given a title or an appointed position. I can and will do more good if I were made a Federal Agent at Large and I will help out by doing it my through my communications with people of all ages. . . . I am on this plane with Sen. George Murphy [ of California ] and we have been discussing the problems that our country is faced with.

Sir, I am staying at the Washington Hotel, Room 505-506-507 -- I have 2 men who work with me by the name of Jerry Schilling and Sonny West. I am registered under the name of Jon Burrows. I will be here for as long as it takes to get the credentials of a Federal Agent. I have done an in-depth study of drug abuse and Communist brainwashing techniques and I am right in the middle of the whole thing where I can and will do the most good.
