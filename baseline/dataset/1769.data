For Wes Anderson, the idea of a "Fantastic Mr. Fox" movie, developed from Roald Dahl's classic children's novel, has always been inseparable from stop motion, the painstaking method that requires miniature figures to be moved in increments and photographed one frame at a time.



The main characters on "Mr. Fox" were produced in at least three sizes, ranging from about an inch (for wide shots, usually in the more involved action sequences) to more than a foot tall (for closeups).
