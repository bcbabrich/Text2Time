To the Editor:

Last weekend, my family and I traveled to Washington to welcome and walk with the Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament, several hundred brave, conscious and caring people, who have walked from California to Washington since last March (Washington Talk page, Nov. 15).

Their message has been one of peace. All have left their former lives to help spread word of the insanity of the arms race. There were doctors, lawyers, grandmothers and grandchildren, students, white-collar and blue-collar workers - just real people who have the same gut feeling. They love life and don't want it to end. We were 10,000 strong on Saturday, first at Meridian Park, then at Lafayette Park, just across from the White House, and finally, at the Lincoln Memorial. We heard the scientist and scholar Carl Sagan address the insanity of ''Star Wars,'' describing a world without peace as a world in pieces, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who spoke of the marchers as ''morally right,'' trying to save the world from total destruction.

There were two other notable people not far off this weekend, Ronald Reagan and Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Standing just across the street from the White House brought visions of President Reagan congratulating baseball teams and football teams after great victories, welcoming our astronauts and great artists and musicians as they stood outside on the White House lawn. I could hear his recent and repeated wishes for a world at peace and an end to nuclear weapons. Yet, Ronald Reagan was not there to welcome the peace marchers.

My wife's 8-year-old boy, a marcher (he was with his father for six months of the march), could not understand why. There was not a word of recognition, and Mr. Reagan should feel ashamed for his silence. I wish he could understand that peace is patriotic. ROBERT CHRUST Key West, Fla., Nov. 18, 1986
