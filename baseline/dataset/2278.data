Eliot Spitzer’s attack yesterday on a key Pataki ally, Charles Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, was not well received in Pataki-land.

The attorney general had criticized development upstate and told a Buffalo area crowd on Thursday that the ESDC should be run by someone who was “not just hanging out in Manhattan, going to cocktail parties with celebrities.”

Yesterday, a spokesman for the development corporation, Mark Weinberg, said, “we were surprised by such a mean-spirited, personal and undeserved attack.”

“It seems disingenuous, considering that Mr. Spitzer attends social and cultural events himself, and surely he must recognize their role in developing relationships that are useful in advancing the public agenda,” he added.
