Mark Bittman on food and all things related.

My father — who turned 89 this past Sunday, bless him — grew up what’s now called “food insecure.” Like many immigrants, the Bittman family ate whatever they could get their hands on. This served them well when dinner was a boiled potato with sour cream.

It served them less well after World War II, when every male in the family was making $60 a week or more, which wasn’t bad when $60 paid the rent. Soon thereafter, my paternal grandparents and their sons — my father had three brothers — were way overweight, even obese. All developed diabetes and heart disease.[1]

My father is the only survivor. Both those grandparents and two of my three uncles were dead by the time they were the (tender) age I am now.

Of the two edges of the sword of America’s malnutrition — hunger and obesity — the latter is by far the more prevalent and deadly. In New York City perhaps 2 percent of children have “very low food security,” which might mean vitamin deficiencies, a day without food, a loss of weight, a month of being hungry[2]. Meanwhile, 40 percent of New York’s public school students are overweight or obese, and 2,000 New Yorkers die each year from obesity or overweight-related conditions. All of those deaths are preventable.



No one should belittle even a little hunger, but this why-do-we-even-have-to-talk-about-it comparison of it and obesity is germane because the city’s Health Department recently suspended expansion of the Breakfast in the Classroom (BIC) program, which serves free breakfast in the classrooms of 381 of 1,750 public schools. The program is ostensibly meant to ensure that hungry kids start the day with something to eat.

But the school system already offers every kid, all 1.1 million of them, regardless of income, the opportunity to have free breakfast in the school cafeteria. BIC simply puts that breakfast on every kid’s desk.

The Health Department reined in BIC after finding that roughly 20 percent of all kids might be eating two breakfasts: one before arriving at school and another at their desks, adding on average about 90 unneeded calories to their daily intake. Linda Gibbs, deputy mayor for Health and Human Services, explained that the city wants to make “sure that that no child goes hungry and that every child has access to a healthy breakfast,” but at the same time “wants to be cautious that our good intentions don’t inadvertently exacerbate the obesity issue,” noting the 40 percent figure cited above.

The move’s critics, including some anti-hunger groups, believe that measures to prevent obesity cannot be taken at the expense of addressing hunger and that it’s unconscionable not to act to prevent kids from going hungry.[3] (Ironically enough, some research suggests that hunger may lead to obesity. That was my family’s story.)

But at this point our moral aversion to hunger must be matched by our distress about kids eating themselves sick. Not only does obesity lead to increased rates of Type 2 diabetes, but a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine also found that the heaviest kids were nearly twice as likely as the thinnest to die before age 55.

Still: instead of arguing who needs help more — hungry kids or obese ones — we should help both, starting by recognizing that combating poverty and fighting the dominance of the food “system” that promotes junk at the expense of real food are the ways to conquer both obesity and hunger.

The ostensible rationale for BIC is not to provide free school breakfasts to food-insecure kids, since such a program already exists, but to reduce the stigma of going to claim breakfast in the cafeteria. There are indeed issues of making it to the cafeteria before the bell rings (what if the bus is late?), but if my memory serves me, the stigma of being an overweight 8-year-old is at least as bad as having skipped breakfast at home and having to get it at school. [4]

A serious program for healthy kids might offer occasional snacks of apples, carrots and celery instead of boxed cereal or a cheese stick, both common BIC options. Part of why that doesn’t happen is because perversely named “specialty crops” (you call them “fruits and vegetables”) aren’t supported by the Department of Agriculture in the same way as commodity crops like corn. [5]

Fruits and vegetables should and could be overflowing in classrooms, but that would benefit only kids. The people who really benefit from BIC are, as usual, the companies that market that food and that stand to increase their sales by billions of dollars if BIC were to become a national mandate.

And though the work of anti-hunger organizations like Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) is essential, some of their financing comes from the likes of ConAgra, Kraft, Tyson and the National Dairy Council. And it doesn’t take a cynic to imagine why Kraft or the Dairy Council might like to see kids starting the day with cereal or cheese. Nor is it difficult to imagine them influencing FRAC, in the same way that Big Food’s lobbying and campaign contributions[6] might affect the farm bill. Similarly, when the C.E.O. of Weight Watchers International is a co-author of an op-ed criticizing the city’s Health Department for making obesity a greater priority than hunger, I can’t help thinking about just how much Weight Watchers would profit if yet another generation of Americans got fat. Shame on me, I know.

This is complicated, and many of the critics of the Health Department’s actions are allies on other issues. But the vast majority of kids do not need more calories (simply put, more calories to more kids means more obesity), and the real battles should be to subsidize healthy food, discourage junk, eradicate junk food advertising to children, preserve and expand beneficial food assistance programs, and have food policy determined by experts and citizens rather than by corporations and the elected officials who are in their pockets. At the same time, let’s all — parents, teachers, administrators and concerned citizens — encourage those kids who need a free breakfast to make their way to the cafeteria, where it awaits them.
