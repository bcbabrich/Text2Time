The proposals, however, have met Pentagon reluctance. In addition, some senior officials have insisted that the intelligence agencies come up with convincing evidence of a state tie to terrorism that could be made public.

The composition of the group claiming to have kidnapped Colonel Higgins, the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, illustrates the difficulties the Bush Administration is likely to face if it concludes that the Marine officer has been killed.

American officials believe the Oppressed on Earth is a faction in the Party of God, a loosely organized group of about 600 Shiite militants dispersed throughout Lebanon who receive guidance and support from Iran. The Oppressed on Earth operates in southern Lebanon, and American officials believe its leaders are separate from the various Party of God adherents who hold the other 16 Western hostages in Beirut.

The officials said their first priority would be to determine whether Colonel Higgins had been killed by his kidnappers from the Party of God. One official said the Central Intelligence Agency suspects he may have been killed earlier, but other officials said this was as yet unproved. Military Options

Present and former officials said most of the options likely to be presented to President Bush in the next few days would be military, not diplomatic. There is no viable government in Lebanon, and Iran, which has no diplomatic relations with the United States, has proved itself largely impervious to American overtures delivered through third countries.
