James naturally wants more rings and surely believes that the Lakers will keep making moves to build the sort of squad that can actually help him win his fourth — presumably by continuing their efforts to trade for Kawhi Leonard. But he’s also not going to force himself to go to Philadelphia in the name of an easier playoff path if he and his family would rather live in Southern California. I’ve consistently said that I wouldn’t dare leave the ever-forgiving Eastern Conference if I were him, but it should be pretty clear by now that he has little interest in external opinions. I’m not sure he even hears the debate-show shouters anymore.

LeBron will readily leave the legacy debates to everyone else and, if my instinct is right, enjoy how much chaos his choice has caused on a zillion basketball fronts. The Western Conference is now home to all seven active M.V.P.s in the league: James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Dirk Nowitzki and Derrick Rose. That list doesn’t even include Anthony Davis, Jimmy Butler, Donovan Mitchell and two more Golden State All-Stars: Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. The gulf between the conferences, which seemingly dates to Jordan’s second retirement with the Chicago Bulls in 1998, has never looked wider.

Things might be even more grim for Clevelanders and their Cavaliers, who have now lost the game’s best player twice and have to live with the knowledge that the Cavs’ ill-fated acquisitions of Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr. in February that were designed to try to save their season helped the Lakers create the salary-cap space needed to pilfer James from them.

Another uncomfortable truth: The Lakers might have already won the summer by dominating the James sweepstakes, but the Warriors can’t really lose it if the other 29 teams out there haven’t legitimately closed the gap by the time training camps open in late September.

The Lakers themselves, frankly, still have a few questions to answer, after following up the James coup by immediately coming to terms with the world’s foremost LeBron irritant: Lance Stephenson. How James and Lonzo Ball’s infamously vocal father LaVar coexist in the same ZIP code is another source of considerable curiosity, which explains why a number of rival teams already expect the Lakers to try to ship Lonzo Ball out at the first opportunity.

So, yes, there is much to unpack here.

But we have time to get into all that. The Summer of LeBron doesn’t usually move this quickly. Let the magnitude of the moment sink in for at least a few more days before the fretting begins in earnest.

James didn’t win a championship in his first season with Miami, nor did he win it all in his first season after going back to Cleveland for his second stint with the Cavaliers. If he’s easing into another new arrangement, as signing a four-year deal with the Lakers would suggest, we don’t have to have all the answers right away, either.
