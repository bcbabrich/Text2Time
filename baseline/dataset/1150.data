The nominations for the new president of the World Bank are closed. For the next several weeks the board of directors will be considering three candidates:

· Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a Nigerian, has a doctorate in regional economics and development from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She was the managing director of the World Bank from 2007 to 2011 and is currently the finance minister of Nigeria. Many think she’s the natural choice for the next president. Her appointment would mean that a woman would lead the World Bank at the same time that a woman heads the International Monetary Fund

· José Antonio Ocampo, a Colombian, has been the United Nations under-secretary general for Economics & Social Affairs and the finance minister of Colombia. He has a doctorate in economics from Yale University and is currently a professor at Columbia University’s School of International & Public Affairs in New York. He is known for leading Colombia through Latin America’s financial crisis.

· Jim Yong Kim, a Korean-American, is a medical doctor and also has a Ph.D. in anthropology from Harvard University. He was a founder of Partners in Health, a nonprofit agency that developed a successful, replicable model to provide health care to the poor. He is president of Dartmouth College and is President Barack Obama’s choice for president of the World Bank.

Normally that would be enough. Since the World Bank’s inception in 1944, the president has always been an American because the United States is the largest stakeholder in the bank. However, the World Bank Group consists of 187 countries, and its main objective now is to loan money to poor countries. With the waning of the American economy and the waxing of developing countries, people have begun to wonder if the next president should come from outside the United States, perhaps from the developing world.

Jeffrey Sachs wrote an op-ed arguing for a non-American president: “For too long, the bank’s leadership has imposed U.S. concepts that are often utterly inappropriate for the poorest countries and their poorest people.”

Others have suggested the most qualified person be selected, regardless of nationality. An op-ed by three former World Bank executives (Francois Bourguignon, Nicholas Stern and Joseph Stiglitz) said: “Let the competition be open; let the U.S. and Europe live up to their words and let them behave as if it really is a World Bank.”

Last week, the leaders of the BRICS countries mooted the idea of starting a separate development bank.

In such a climate and in these egalitarian times where we all can put in our 2 cents (or 1 rupee) via the Internet, who would you choose for the president of the World Bank? And what is the basis for your choice? Would you choose based on nationality or merit? Would you choose an academic, a politician, a financier, a development expert or someone with a variety of experience? Would you decide based on whether they came from a developed country or a rising economy?

Here are some of the names being discussed: Hillary Rodham Clinton (U.S. secretary of state), Indra Nooyi (C.E.O. of PepsiCo), Timothy F. Geithner (U.S. secretary of the treasury), Muhammad Yunus (Bangladeshi economist, a.k.a. “Banker to the Poor”), and Mr. Sachs (American economist, U.N. adviser and founder of Millennium Promise Alliance). Or you may choose from among the official nominees.

Who would be your choice for the next president of the World Bank, and why?
