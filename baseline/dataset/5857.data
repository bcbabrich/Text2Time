The Consolidated Foods Corporation said today that shareholders of Nicholas Kiwi Ltd. had approved a Consolidated Foods offer to buy a major share of Kiwi for $330 million.

Since its first offer of $250 million for 75 percent of Kiwi on Oct. 2, Consolidated Foods had been locked in a bidding war for Kiwi with Reckitt & Colman P.L.C., a major British household products company.

Kiwi is an Australian maker of household, shoe and personal-care products.

John H. Bryan Jr., chairman and chief executive of Consolidated Foods, which is based in Chicago, said in a telephone interview from Melbourne, Australia, that shareholders apparently were swayed by the offer of cash, plus stock in ''the new Nicholas Kiwi Australia.''

Under the agreement, Consolidated would acquire all of Kiwi's non-Australian operations, which account for about 80 percent of the company's sales. It would also own 15 percent of Kiwi's Australian operations. Mr. Bryan said that Kiwi's current management would continue to supervise its worldwide operations.
