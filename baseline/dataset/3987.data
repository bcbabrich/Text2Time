Reggie Lewis's widow yesterday sued the team of cardiologists that said the Boston Celtics star could eventually return to basketball after he collapsed during a playoff game.

DONNA HARRIS-LEWIS claimed in a suit filed in Suffolk Superior Court in Boston that Dr. GILBERT MUDGE JR. of Brigham and Women's Hospital and three associates were negligent in telling Lewis he could play again.

Lewis collapsed during an April 29, 1993, playoff game in Boston Garden. He died three months later, after being stricken a second time while shooting baskets with friends.

Harris-Lewis's suit, which seeks unspecified damages, claims Mudge failed to treat Lewis with the "standard care and skill." Brigham and Women's defended Mudge and his associates yesterday, Drs. MARK CREAGER and PETER FRIEDMAN of Brigham and Women's, and Dr. JOHN RUTHERFORD of Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.
