Overview of Lesson Plan: Students will examine and discuss examples of Native American art. They will speculate about when and where the works were created and by whom, and discuss the distinctive features and styles of the works. Students will then read the article ‘Fading Indian Rock Art Saved, at least in Database’ and discuss its contents. After viewing and discussing in class examples of works of art from a variety of periods and places, students will choose a particular time and place on which to conduct research about the relationship between art and society. After students have conducted their research (as homework or during subsequent class periods), they will make presentations to the class.



Suggested Time Allowance: One 1-hour class period

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Examine and discuss examples of American Indian art.

2. Read and discuss pertinent facts from the article, “Fading Indian Rock Art Saved, at Least in Database.”

3. Examine and discuss examples of art from different times and places.

4. Homework: Research a particular period and place with respect to art and its relationship to society, and present their research to the class.

Resources / Materials:

pens and pencils

student journals

slides, photographs, or other reproductions of several Native American works of art, as well as works of art from other cultures and periods

copies of “Fading Indian Rock Art Saved, at Least in Database” (one for each student)

optional: slide projector

optional: CD-ROMs (art history, collections of art)

optional: computer with Internet access for accessing the web sites of museums to view their collections

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Show students several photographs or reproductions of Native American art. (Use slides and a slide projector if possible.) Choose examples of art that appear to tell a story and that represent different, distinctive styles. Do not label or otherwise identify them. Allow time for students to examine the works carefully. Ask them to briefly respond to the following questions in their journals, or have a whole-class discussion. Encourage students to speculate even if they aren’t sure about the answers.

a. Who do you think created these works of art, and when do you think they were created?

b. How would you describe the styles in these works? What materials were used to create them?

c. What information or “story” do you see in these works of art? What do they tell you about the people and culture that produced them?

d. What types of art do you like? Describe one of your favorite pieces of art. When was it made? Who was the artist?

2. Students read the article, “Fading Indian Rock Art Saved, at Least in Database.” Use the following questions to review the content of the article:

a. What type of art is Evelyn Billo of Rupestrian Cyber Services trying to create permanent records of?

b. What type of technology tools are being used in this project? How (in what medium) will the information be saved? Who will have access to it?

c. How does Dr. Mark use technology to show the changes in a rock face through the years? Describe the process. Why is this important?

d. What can archeologists learn from preserving these petroglyphs?

3. Display representative works of art from a variety of periods and places and showing a variety of styles. Use these to elicit students’ views and ideas about the value of art, the role it plays in reflecting the period and place in which it was created, and particular artistic styles and media. Get the discussion going with these questions:

a. Do you think it’s important to preserve the petroglyphs described in the article? Why or why not?

b. Why are the petroglyphs important to Native Americans today? Are they important to other Americans? What about people from other countries? Explain your ideas.

c. Can you name some modern artists? Describe their work. Can you name some artists from the past? What do you know about them and their work?

d. In what ways does art give us information about the time and place in which it was created?

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Have students, individually or in small groups, choose a specific period and place–e.g., the 1960s in the United States; the 5th century in what is now the American West; the 18th century in France; the 12th century in the Yucatan Peninsula; etc.). Students may make their choices based on historical events or periods (e.g., the Colonial period in the U.S.) or personal interest. Once they have chosen the period and the place, students conduct research to learn about the art of that time and place and relate it to culture and history. Ask students to prepare presentations (multimedia if possible) in which they address these questions:

a. Is there a particular artistic style that is identified with this period and place?

b. Who were the most prominent artists of this period and place?

c. What are the key features of this period and place in relation to culture, society, politics, economics, science, and technology?

d. What literary works are associated with this time and place?

Set aside class time for students to make presentations of their work to the class..

Further Questions for Discussion:

–If you were an artist, how would you ensure that your work was accessible to people living 100 years from now and beyond?

–In what other ways is technology being used to preserve art, information, and other “products” of today for the future? Give several examples.

–If you were going to paint a picture that told an important story or conveyed an important idea about the world in which you live, what would be in that painting?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated on their responses to the questions on American Indian Art, participation in class discussion on the article, “Fading Indian Rock Art Saved, at Least in Database,” group research project on a specific art movement that took place in the United States within the last 500 years.

Vocabulary:

erosion, petroglyphs, methodically, archeologists, preservationists, aerial, topographical, accumulated, sandstone, vandalism, morphing, lichen

Extension Activities:

1. Visit a real life or online museum (there are many web sites that contain collections of artwork by specific artists). View a collection that appeals to you and report on it. Who is the artist? What is your favorite piece from this collection? What have you observed about this artist’s style of art?

2. Compare the art created by different ancient Native American peoples in terms of style, subject/content, and media.

3. Learn about petroglyphs and cave/rock paintings found in other parts of the world. When were they created and by whom? How are they similar to and how are they different from those found in North America?

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Graphic Design:

Using a computer graphics application, design a layout for a database. The database may contain any type of information that pertains to your personal life that you would like to pass on to your children.

Science:

Research and report on an archeological dig. Where did this archeological dig take place? What was found? What did scientists learn from this dig? Where and how are these objects being stored?
