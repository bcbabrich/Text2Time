All across the country, people are answering their cellphones to the strains of ''The Star Spangled Banner.''

Since Sept. 11, a synthesized version of the national anthem has been the favorite option downloaded by subscribers of AT&T Wireless, which gives customers hundreds of tune options to replace the standard ring tone of a cellphone.

Sonera Zed, the company that provides the downloads from http:// ringtoneselect.mobile.att.net, a Web site accessible only to AT&T Wireless customers, said ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' had leaped more than 400 slots to the top of its popularity charts by Sept. 13. The song has remained at No. 1 since then, followed by ''America the Beautiful'' at No. 2 and ''God Bless America'' at No. 4.

Falling to third place was the tune of the song ''Follow Me'' by the Uncle Kracker, which had occupied the top slot for four weeks until it was bumped by the national anthem.
