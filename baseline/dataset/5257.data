Lawrence A. Smiley will be the first Manhattan developer to renovate city-owned shells for low- and moderate-income families as part of a new 421-a tax abatement program. Except he has not yet been shown the buildings. As Mr. Smiley completes work on Lexington Parc, whose 73 market-rate condominiums will benefit from the 10-year tax reduction, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development is still choosing two suitable buildings for the 22 apartments he is required to renovate. The $15 million building at 127 East 30th Street will be completed in October, and Mr. Smiley said he would begin the $800,000 renovation of the city buildings as soon they materialize. ''It's bouncing around from commissioner to commissioner,'' he said. The new condominium is being built next to the century-old Pratt Institute, a New York City landmark. Mr. Smiley purchased an air-rights easement from the United Jewish Appeal, which owns the Pratt building, and transferred air rights from three brownstones he owns on the block to build 18 floors at the site. The brick, granite and limestone tower, designed by Peter Clamon, will have one- and two-bedroom units starting at $200,000 and $300,000, respectively.
