The athletes seem to be making the most of their second chance.

According to Mr. Burnham, players entering the N.F.L. without a degree had a mean grade point average of 1.9 in college, but those who resume their studies achieve a 3.2.

For players, motivations vary. Donnie Edwards, a linebacker with the Kansas City Chiefs who recently polished off his master's in education administration at the University of California at Los Angeles, cites a boyhood visit to the home of a well-to-do family where he was told that a college degree was the way to a big house and a white picket fence. Others see it as key to their stature as role models, or as a fallback for their life after football -- no small consideration, given that the average duration of a pro football career is three and a half years, to say nothing of the hazards of a profession where one injury can lead to abrupt career displacement.

''Football is a small window in your life,'' said the Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy, who encourages bench warmers and high-profile athletes alike to finish college. A few Buccaneers have even taken classes in-season, which is fine with Mr. Dungy. ''As long as it didn't jeopardize what he had to do on the field, I wouldn't be against it.''

Here are five players who went the whole nine yards.

KEN NORTON JR.

Between them, Ken Norton Jr. and his father have won three Super Bowls and boxing's heavyweight championship of the world. But no man in the Norton family could call himself a college graduate until this past June, when the younger Norton, 12 years removed from his starring days at U.C.L.A., returned to the university and received his diploma as his father, wife and three children watched.

Mr. Norton, 32, a gifted linebacker for the San Francisco 49ers who holds the team record for the most tackles in a single season (165), said a feeling gnawed at him as he raised his children.
