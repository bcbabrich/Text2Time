To create their new collection of hyper-masculine curiosities, the glass-blowing studio Esque and the art and design firm No. 1 Son (both based in Portland, Ore.) pilfered ideas from millennia past. Aptly named (Bar)barian, the collaboration was inspired by what Andi Kovel and Justin Parker of Esque call the ‘‘noble savage’’: objects that were once made from horn, wood and stone are reimagined in glass and leather. Why serve drinks from an ordinary decanter when you could present (Bar)barian’s Flagon, a swirling glass vessel that resembles the horn of some mythical beast? Or why not go all out with the Travel Bar: two hornlike glasses, a bone-shaped stirrer and a leather studded case in which to lug them? Just don’t go hunting for dinner with the OB-J slingshot. Rendered in wood-colored glass with an inelastic leather strap and fragile handle, it’s entirely nonfunctional. But that’s entirely the point: by allowing utility and convenience to go the way of the woolly mammoth, (Bar)barian has transformed objects from the past into up-to-the-minute pieces of pure decadence.
