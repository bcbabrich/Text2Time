Dear Diary:

A recent trip to Seattle -- where recycling is second nature and environmental transgressions of all sorts weigh heavily on the scales of political incorrectness -- prompted me to return to New York with some new habits. One doesn't have to be a fanatic, I reasoned on the flight back, to cut down on waste. Shopping bags for example. Why not carry a reusable one and save the 10 or so bags a week that accumulate under my sink?

That day I bought a sensible canvas tote and hung it on my apartment door. Of course I forgot to bring it on my first trip to the fruit stand on the corner, but, determined to change my ways (and spread the example), I piped out virtuously, "No bag, please!"

The woman behind the counter watched with some impatience as I tucked a can and a jar under my right arm, balanced two grapefruits between them, then pinned the celery and eggplant to my chest with my free hand. Awkward, to be sure, but I would be less likely to forget the bag in the future.

As I made my exit, I heard the man who'd been behind me on line as he stepped up to the register: "Double bag, please!"

This may take a while. -- JOHN BERLIND . . .

Dear Diary:

As part of my fitness program, I have started walking around Washington Square Park three or four times every day. Early on in this routine I made a discovery that stopped me in my tracks: a large plaque on 79 Washington Square East with "Paulette Goddard" emblazoned on it. I knew Miss Goddard had left the bulk of her $20 million estate to New York University, but I had not known that a residence hall had been named for the actress, who had always been a great favorite of mine.
