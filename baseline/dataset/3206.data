Interbrew, the Belgian maker of Stella Artois and Labatt beer, said documents circulated anonymously to the press about a bid it was preparing for South African Breweries contained falsified information. Corneel Maes, a spokesman, said Interbrew had instructed its bankers to draw up an analysis of S.A.B. as part of a routine assessment of the industry. But that analysis never contained a timetable for starting a bid, he said, adding, ''We never held any merger discussions with S.A.B.'' Interbrew is investigating the matter and has contacted stock market regulators in Belgium and Britain. Mr. Maes said it was too soon to say how the problem would affect Interbrew's relationship with its financial advisers.
