To the Editor:

Jesse Zel Lurie (letter, Sept. 23), contends that Israel should surrender the strategic Golan Heights to Syria because "it's either peace now or war later."

Israel's top military experts seem to disagree. The Israeli Army chief of staff, Gen. Ehud Barak, remarked in Washington recently that "from a professional military standpoint, as long as there is no peace we need every meter of the Golan Heights, and also at a time of peace we had better stay on the Golan Heights."

Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, head of Israel's northern command, called the Golan "a quiet volcano" because Syria has "the power to change the situation from one of peace and quiet in a fairly short time . . . In such circumstances, the Golan is an important strategic asset and security region for the country's north."
