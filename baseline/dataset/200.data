Just as the Duplex opened its doors at 4 in the afternoon, Harry Arkell, 34, a tourist from the United Kingdom, took a seat at the bar and ordered a glass of red wine. The former marketing executive had recently quit his job, ended a relationship and completed a weeklong meditation camp upstate. He would soon be headed for Panama, but not before making a pit stop in New York.

“I was told by a friend the Duplex is an institution,” he said. “I came to see what it was about.”

In 1951 the Duplex opened in a makeshift space above a restaurant on Grove Street. It served as a cabaret theater for Broadway hopefuls and amateur comedians, including a young Joan Rivers — said Thomas Honeck, the theater’s general manager. “It was said Rivers was so bad at the time, they would only let her go last,” he said.

After going through a discothèque phase in the ’70s, the Duplex returned to its cabaret roots, moving to 61 Christopher Street in 1989. On the ground floor, there is a simple piano bar with black vinyl seating that was purchased from a former diner. The wall behind the bar is covered in posters for shows that have long passed. Many of the bartenders have vocal chops, so it is not unusual to find some of them singing musical numbers from “Kinky Boots” or pop songs by Elton John or Ariana Grande.

From the Seventh Avenue and Christopher Street intersection, passers-by can glimpse an often rowdy and enthusiastic crowd singing through its many French doors.
