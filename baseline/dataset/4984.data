Judge Souter's personal - not his professional - resume raises troublesome questions. We do not see in his past a body of experience with people other than white middle-class males. He resides in a tiny New Hampshire town (population about 2,000), lives in the same small farmhouse in which he was born, has never married and apparently has almost no social life. The Senate may well be looking at a nominee whose major experience with blacks comes from watching the ''Cosby Show'' and whose deepest understanding of the concerns of women comes from books and perhaps films.

Our society has expended effort to create social institutions in which people of all kinds and both sexes can mingle. We have done this because we have more than an intuitive sense of the value of social integration and the peril of social isolation.

Social inclusion can produce a truly intelligent American: one who can relate to our national life in all its facets, who knows the wellspring -the aspirations and fears, the affections and indifferences - from which particular kinds of thought and behavior flow. Social and geographical seclusion, however, may very well yield an intellectual who may be smart on technical matters but lacking ''intelligence of the heart'' when it comes to human affairs.

From all accounts, our society will become even more diverse as we enter the next century. Whites will be outnumbered by blacks, Hispanics, Asians and other people of color. As our least democratic governmental institution, the Supreme Court can least afford to be managed by those from elites who have little feel for their social environment.

If the news reports about Judge Souter are correct, it is fair to say that no other male nominee to the Supreme Court in recent memory has so distanced himself from minorities, women, the disabled, the downtrodden and the powerless as Judge Souter has.

Justice Marshall was as correct in apparently questioning the judge's ability to relate to life as the President was remiss in focusing only on the judge's ability to handle technical legal questions. The Senate Judiciary Committee must now assure the American people that Judge Souter is qualified on both counts.
