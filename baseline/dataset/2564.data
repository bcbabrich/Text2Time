MILLIONS know her as the ice queen of Thursday night: each week on ''The Apprentice,'' NBC's hit reality show, Carolyn Kepcher crosses her thin arms, as if to restrain herself from throwing up her hands, her blue gaze brittle as she scrutinizes the diminishing group of candidates competing for a $250,000 job with her boss, Donald Trump.

An executive vice president with a blond bouffant and exquisitely proper business attire, she is merciless and mirthless, especially in the boardroom scenes, as she eviscerates performances, helping to determine who is not worthy to toil for Himself.

''Carolyn is beautiful and she has a great look,'' Mr. Trump says of the businesswoman who oversees 250 Trump Organization employees and has worked for him almost as long as she's been married (a decade, to George, a project manager for another developer). ''But she is all business and not a lot of monkey business.''

Maybe so -- she did allow herself just three weeks' maternity leave after the births of Connor, 31/2, and Cassidy, 19 months -- but this tall, pretty woman, laughing and smiling as she dashes into her office at the Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., looks younger and more approachable than she does on TV. (She's 35.) Dressed with hip, vivid warmth in a black leather jacket, black pants, heels and a fire-engine-red turtleneck, with a softer, flattering haircut, Ms. Kepcher has a contagious energy as she whirls around, taking just one call. It's Himself.
