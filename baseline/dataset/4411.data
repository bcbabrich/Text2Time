A Village Bistro Reopens

Upon walking into the recently reopened La Gauloise in Greenwich Village, you would never guess that it had been closed for a year. The dining room still has a languid, Gallic atmosphere, with its handsome Belle Epoque bar and cozy dining room with polished wood trim, mirrored panels and soft lighting.

The restaurant, on the Avenue of the Americas near 13th Street, has been revived by Steve Tzolis. the principal owner of Il Cantinori, Periyali and Aureole, all in Manhattan.

Mr. Tzolis also owns the defunct Harvey's Chelsea House on West 18th Street, which he said he plans to renovate and reopen as an American restaurant.

At La Gauloise, the new chef is Jean-Robert de Clavel, who was the chef at Le Regence in the Hotel Plaza Athenee in Manhattan.
