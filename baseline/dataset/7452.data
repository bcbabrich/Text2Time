It's a woman's world when it comes to shopping, and an executive appointment by S. H. Kress & Co., announced over the weekend, gives full recognition to this fact of life.

The variety store chain, a division of Genesco, Inc., has appointed Jimmi York to the new post of vice president for development of merchandise specifically for women.

Miss York will endeavor to come up with, a Kress spokesman says, “more imaginative, more colorful, more female‐ishtype merchandise.” Among her responsibilities will be the development of “impulse” items and color‐coordinated merchandise in such fields as fashions and home furnishings for sale to the predominantly feminine Kress shoppers.

Working with both old and new suppliers, Miss York will attempt to develop a wide range of private‐label merchandise in key areas. Kress already has an extensive private brand program with many outlets.
