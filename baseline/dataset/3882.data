Governor Whitman, like the incumbent before her, was endorsed yesterday by the State Policemen's Benevolent Association, an umbrella group of 350 local police unions with 32,000 members.

The association's president, Michael Madonna, praised her for signing laws allowing retired officers to carry guns, ''Megan's Law'' to identify sex offenders to the communities where they live, and a law authorizing life sentences for a defendant with three felony convictions.

Richard McGrath, a spokesman for Senator McGreevey, the Democratic challenger, said the endorsement was no surprise considering that the group traditionally backed incumbents. The police union backed Gov. Jim Florio in 1993, before he lost to Mrs. Whitman.
