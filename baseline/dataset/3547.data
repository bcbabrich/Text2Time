The Egyptair Boeing 767 that crashed this morning was a relatively new model with a good safety record, operated by an airline with extensive international experience and relatively few operational problems, although some horrible security failures.

The plane was delivered new to Egyptair almost exactly 10 years ago, on Sept. 26, 1989, and had completed about 6,900 flights, covering about 30,000 flight hours since then -- about normal for a long-range plane of that age.

Egyptair operated five 767's, including the plane that crashed. It was one of its two extended-range 767-300's, the newest version produced by Boeing; it could fly 7,080 miles nonstop, putting Cairo well within range of New York.

Egyptair is one of the world's oldest airlines, tracing its operations to 1933. It is owned by the government and a candidate for privatization under a new policy of economic liberalization.
