Some Congressional Republicans are seriously undermining the 2000 census by suggesting that the national head count, which officially takes place today, is an invasion of privacy. That bizarre complaint could discourage the public from participating in a project that is crucial to the functioning of state and federal government.

The questions on this year's long census form -- including questions on household income, plumbing facilities and physical disabilities -- have been part of the census for decades. The only new question asks for information on grandparents who are caregivers for children. In fact, this year's long form is the shortest one in 60 years. All answers on census forms are kept confidential.

Yet Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska has suggested in recent days that people can simply ignore questions on the long form -- which goes to one out of six American households -- that they find intrusive. A spokesman for Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, has made similarly inappropriate suggestions. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has said that people should fill out the forms, but that if he received a long form, he was not sure he would want to fill it out either.

These comments are irresponsible. Completing the census form fully and accurately is not optional; it is a civic duty that is required by law. Senator Hagel now says that he does not want to encourage people to break the law, but will introduce legislation to make most of the questions on the long form voluntary.
