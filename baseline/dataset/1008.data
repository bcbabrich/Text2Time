LONG--Joan. On Thursday, June 20th, 2013 Joan D. Long relaxed her hold on the world she fiercely loved. A graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design, Columbia University, and Fordham University, Joan was a painter, ceramist, and dedicated recreational therapist. Joan was tender, elusive, practical, wildly inventive, and gave aesthetic consideration to all of her endeavors. She gently but relentlessly pushed for clarity in her work, in art, and in matters of the heart. Like Charlotte A. Cavatica, the noble spider of children's literature, Joan leaves a generation of descendants born of her encouragement and wise counsel. Dear friend, sister, cousin, and aunt, you are irreplaceable. A memorial service for Joan will be announced at a later date
