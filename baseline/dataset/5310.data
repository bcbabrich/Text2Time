Already, spies have gone to Morris Stewart's workshop in Brooklyn to see what is new among the mounds of brightly colored plumes, metallic baubles and bolts of shimmering red, gold and silver fabric.

Mr. Stewart is making what could well be the winning costumes for the West Indian-American Carnival in Brooklyn, and competing designers would like an advance look. Like other designers, he keeps his creations hidden until the carnival, which begins tonight.

''I'm the person they want to beat,'' said Mr. Stewart, a barrel-chested weight lifter and former appliance repairer whose costumes for carnival king and queen have won more prizes than those of other designers.

''They think my king will be a dragon, but it will be much, much more, a space monster,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''It will be 17 feet high and 20 feet long. I use my colors as a weapon, and they are very sharp this time.''
