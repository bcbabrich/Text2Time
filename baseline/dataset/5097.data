The Fireman's Fund Insurance Company said that William M. McCormick would resign as chairman, president and chief executive by the end of the year. Jack Byrne, chairman of the Fireman's Fund Corporation, the holding company, will assume Mr. McCormick's duties in an acting capacity.

''I've decided my work here is coming to completion, and it's time to move on to new challenges,'' Mr. McCormick wrote in a letter to Fireman's board. He said he had no firm plans but was eager to return to the Northeast to be closer to his children. He will remain on Fireman's board. A spokeswoman said that

Mr. Byrne, who is 56 years old, is expected to take on Mr. McCormick's positions permanently after the board meets next month. Mr. McCormick, who is 48, joined Fireman's in December 1983.

As an employee of the American Express Company when it owned Fireman's Fund, Mr. McCormick was sent to deal with the insurance company's problems and stayed on after it was spun off as a public company. American Express still holds nine million shares, or about 18 percent of Fireman's.
