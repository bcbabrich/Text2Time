The New York Stock Exchange plans to re-examine its rules for coordinated halts in trading in the market, known as circuit breakers, John J. Phelan Jr., its chairman, said yesterday.

The exchange board meets tomorrow, when it is expected to announce a series of rule revisions to deal with market volatility. ''We have to revisit the circuit breaker to see if we have adequate ones,'' Mr. Phelan said yesterday, adding that the re-examination is likely to focus on cross-market circuit breakers, which would affect the futures markets in Chicago and the Big Board.

''We will probably come out with some short-term things that will speak to the concerns that people have,'' Mr. Phelan said of the Thursday meeting. There has been a rising tide of complaints about index arbitrage, a form of program trading that is based on differing prices in the stock market and the stock index futures market. But Mr. Phelan declined to be more specific about what changes might be adopted.

The exchange has been holding a series of meetings with major participants in the markets in recent days. Yesterday, officials met with executives at the top trading desks of Wall Street's largest firms.
