After taking a tongue lashing from President Obama, Chrysler’s holdout lenders got a show of support from The Financial Times’s John Gapper.

“Unlike Barack Obama and others, I have sympathy for the hedge funds and other investment funds that rejected the Chrysler restructuring offer and forced it into Chapter 11 bankruptcy,” Mr. Gapper wrote in a column titled “In defence of the Chrysler hedge funds.”

On Thursday, Mr. Obama railed against the holdout lenders, now effectively a hostile group of business partners, whom he called “speculators.”

“They were hoping that everybody else would make sacrifices, and they would have to make none,” Mr. Obama said of the creditors, among them several hedge funds and boutique investment funds. “I don’t stand with them.”

Most of the major debtholders, led by JPMorgan Chase, agreed to write down the debt owed to them by more than two-thirds. That put the onus on the remaining holdouts — including units of OppenheimerFunds, Xerion Capital Fund of Perella Weinberg Partners and Stairway Capital — which argued they were falling victim to the willingness of their big banking partners in Chrysler to play nice with a government that had helped bail them out as well. Perella Weinberg decided late Thursday that it would accept the government’s terms.

Administration officials said the holdouts’ position left them no option but to force Chrysler into bankruptcy.

“Well, yes,” Mr. Gapper wrote, “except that some of these ‘speculators’ inconveniently manage money on behalf of pension plans and endowments, rather than rapacious rich people. They have a fiduciary duty to get the best deal they can on behalf of their investors.”

“I also take seriously their point that, although they are higher up in the ranks of creditors than Chrysler’s unions, notably the UAW, they were offered less for their investments,” Mr. Gapper added.

The secured lenders, contending that they are being unfairly blamed for sending the automaker into bankruptcy protection, say that the Obama administration is skirting bankruptcy law by forcing them to take a larger loss on their debt than other Chrysler stakeholders.

The group, which is calling itself the Committee of Non-TARP Lenders, said Thursday that it had been compelled to negotiate through a group of big banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, that have accepted government bailout money and so are reluctant to push back against the Treasury Department’s proposal. They claim the government has ignored their proposals to restructure Chrysler.

Mr. Gapper agreed with that assessment, writing: “President Obama is trying to use the bully pulpit of the presidency to shove these investors into taking a worse deal than they could ordinarily expect under Chapter 11. The Tarp-funded banks that voted for the deal were no doubt aware of how they might be pilloried if they did not do so.”

However, not all industry watchers were feeling the love for the holdout lenders. The Washington Post’s Steven Pearlstein took them to task in a broad swipe at the hedge fund industry.

“There may be nothing more pathetic than a hedge-fund manager worked up in a moral lather, complaining that he hasn’t been treated fairly. Since when did any of these guys ever worry about fairness?” Mr. Pearlstein wrote.

The columnist said he didn’t “recall receiving even a single e-mail from a hedge-fund manager complaining about how unfair it was that the government stepped in to bail out creditors and counterparties of Citigroup, Bear Stearns and AIG.”

In an editorial on the Chrysler bankruptcy, The New York Times said that by pushing the matter into bankruptcy court, the administration was assuming that the judge would also reject the holdouts’ demands.

“There are reasons to hope it will work out that way. In particular, a judge may be unwilling to favor the dissident bondholders when other significant stakeholders have been able to come to agreement outside of court,” The New York Times said.

Bankruptcy always contains some element of unpredictability, and the minority of debtholders who oppose the new arrangement could argue in court that the company is worth more to them in liquidation. Mr. Gapper argued that the holdout creditors may even “have a better chance of getting improved terms from the bankruptcy court than the US administration would have us believe.”
