Four men were charged with beating two off-duty New York City police officers with baseball bats outside a Long Island bar early this morning, the police said.

The officers, Philip Paradiso and Matthew Lidsey, were with their girlfriends outside McQuade's Tavern in Rockville Centre when an argument broke out with four other men about 3:50 A.M., Detective Sgt. Lawrence Gorman said.

Officer Paradiso apparently identified himself as a police officer and his off-duty gun discharged during the argument, Detective Gorman said.

After the gun went off, Paul Ruggerio, 23, attacked Officer Paradiso with a baseball bat.

At some point, Officer Lidsey was also hit with a bat, the police said.
