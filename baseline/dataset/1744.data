Good news for Muslims in Malaysia, at least those who are fans of the Black Eyed Peas: concert organizers said that they could attend a coming performance by the band, after previously stating that the show was open only to non-Muslims, Agence France-Presse reported. A Web site for the concert, which is being held on Sept. 25 near Kuala Lumpur to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Guinness brewery in Dublin, had said that “the party is only open to non-Muslims aged 18 years and above,” and Malaysia’s Ministry of Information, Communication and Culture had said that Muslims could not attend. Of Malaysia’s 25 million people, 60 percent are Muslims; Islamic law forbids the consumption of alcohol. But the concert’s promoters, Artists World Entertainment, said in a statement that the event was now “open to all individuals aged 18 and above,” according to Agence France-Presse. No immediate reason for the change was given, though the original plan to bar Muslims from the show drew widespread attention and criticism.
