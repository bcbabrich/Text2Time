GROWTH IN BUSINESS TRAVEL SEEN -- Business travel continues to rebound, and increased globalization is driving demand for long-haul air travel and international hotel space, American Express Business Travel said last week in its annual forecast. One highlight was that domestic published coach air fares should rise 5 to 8 percent next year over this year's average. That is partly because airlines, including those in bankruptcy protection, have cut domestic schedules and capacity, said Prashanth Kuchibhotla, the senior manager for air procurement for eClipse Advisers, an American Express subsidiary. Another trend, he said, is that business travelers are seeing some changes in policy as corporate travel departments -- reacting to a simplification in fare structures begun by Delta Air Lines and matched by major rivals early this year -- are allowing more use of unrestricted, fully refundable tickets.

MORE BUSINESS JETS -- The business-jet market continues to surge. Shipments of business jets were up 30 percent, to 510 planes, for the first nine months, compared with the period last year, according to the General Aviation Manufacturers Association. Total billings through September were $10.4 billion. At the top of the scale, Airbus shipped six A320-family Airbus Corporate Jets ($300 million total) and Boeing shipped three of its 737-family Boeing Business Jets ($133.5 million).

HOTEL CHAIN RANKINGS Increasingly, global hotel chains and their various brands dominate the hospitality market. The top five international hotel chains, by number of rooms, according to the latest MKG Consulting survey, are InterContinental, 532,701 rooms, up 49 percent since 1995; Cendant, 520,860 rooms, up 26 percent; Marriott, 469,218 rooms, up 154 percent; Accor, 463,427 rooms, up 81 percent; and Choice, 403,806 rooms, up 37 percent. Hilton, which operates the domestic Hilton Corporation and Hilton International separately, had the biggest overall growth, nearly tripling its number of domestic rooms to 354,312. Hilton International had 99,257 rooms, up 80 percent.
