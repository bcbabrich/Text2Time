Mr. Krajcberg is the only exhibitor here to refer to man's abuse of nature. He does this through wooden sculptures of blackened trunks of trees resting on a bed of charcoal. Some of the trunks carry colors as if to remind the viewer that the burning of the Amazon continues. Another sculpture seen here shows the thick roots of a tree springing from its blackened trunk almost likes the legs of a giant tarantula.

Giuseppe Penone, an Italian sculptor, is also interested in trunks and boughs of trees, but these he reproduces in glass and, in this case, has placed them amid the vegetation of Mr. Baumgarten's ''anti-garden.'' The work of Tunga, a Brazilian artist who frequently gives strange forms to everyday objects, is represented here by a large viper made of braided black electric wire.

Two artists have brought art and nature together in a way guaranteed to appeal to visitors. In a work called ''Le Pont'' (1993-1995), which resembles a small glass-covered footbridge, the Paris-based Chinese artist Huang Yong Ping has juxtaposed 18th- and 19th-century Japanese bronzes of animals, snakes and dragons with live tortoises and snakes. (An obligatory notice records that the live animals are being treated according to official regulations.) As it happens, the real snakes and tortoises are usually as immobile as the bronzes, but on one recent afternoon a sleeping snake was at least wrapped around an even more exotic bronze serpent.

Still more fascinating is the work done by a French artist, Hubert Duprat, with the larvae of the caddis fly. These small wormlike life forms are aquatic and live in slender cocoons that they build out of threads, tiny twigs and sand. Since 1983, Mr. Duprat has been giving them flecks of gold, pearl and precious stone with which to make their cocoons. In the exhibition, a continuous film shows one worm busily at work in massive close-up. A few feet away, the sight of several of them in a pool of running water building their temporary jewel-like homes -- they later become moths -- brings the surprise that they are only one inch long.

Like any group show, ''Etre Nature'' can offer no single conclusion beyond the commonplace that, in face of the vastness of nature, artists can be little more than anecdotal. Yet, the inclusion of the Kerchache collection of tropical insects does at least propose that there is no line between art and nature. It is a view that the great French anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss would endorse. ''A bird, a beetle, a butterfly,'' he once said, ''call for the same rapt contemplation that we reserve for a Tintoretto or a Rembrandt.''
