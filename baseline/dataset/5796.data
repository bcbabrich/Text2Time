Brock Adams, who became Secretary of Transportation after six terms in the House of Representatives, is planning to run for the Senate next year from his home state of Washington. A Democrat, he intends to challenge the re-election bid of Senator Slade Gorton, a Republican who won 54 percent of the vote in 1980 on a ticket headed by Ronald Reagan, thereby retiring the Democratic veteran Warren G. Magnuson.

Friends of Mr. Adams predict he would have ''an uphill race'' against the incumbent if he is nominated. As for winning the Democratic nomination, party leaders say Representative Mike Lowry of Seattle is consid-ering entering the primary but otherwise appears to be the only other aspirant. The other four Democrats in the Washington House delegation are reportedly backing the former Cabinet officer, and national party officials have promised him financial and organizational assistance in the general election.

Mr. Adams served in the House from 1965 through 1976 and was the first chairman of the House Budget Committee. President Carter named him Secretary of Transportation in late 1976, and he served until mid-1979. Since then he has practiced law in the Washington office of Garvey, Schubert, Adams & Barer, a Seattle firm. He has made no secret of Senate ambitions, but he was effectively blocked for many years by the formidable Democratic team of Senators Magnuson and Henry M. Jackson.
