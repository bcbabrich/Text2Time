Dear Diary:

This Passover, I ran into the Prophet Elijah on the Amtrak platform in New Rochelle.

I am old, and I had already dragged my luggage through the caverns of Union Station in Washington only to miss my train home to New York. Back to the counter to buy another ticket, this one for a slower train.

When we finally got into the tunnel under Pennsylvania Station, I fell fast asleep. I awoke as we were leaving the station heading north. By the time I got off at the next stop, I had no energy left to drag my luggage up onto the bridge and over the tracks to catch a southbound train.

But there, sitting on a bundle of his stuff, sat Elijah. We had, of course, opened the door for him at the Seder. The littlest children were sure he had sipped wine from his special cup.

No one actually saw him, but I recognized him by his actions. He said: “Let me take your luggage. I know many of the cabdrivers here. I’ll get you a good price.”
