To the Editor:

Contrary to a Sept. 16 letter, there was a Henry IX of Great Britain: This was the style and title assumed by the Cardinal-Duke of York, ''last of the Stuarts,'' when he succeeded to the Stuart claims in 1788, on the death of his elder brother Prince Charles Edward (''Bonnie Prince Charlie,'' or Charles III of Great Britain). He had medals struck in this style and pronunciamentos issued, and he kept right royal state at his seat at Frascati until his death in 1809. That no one recognized his claims, not even the two popes he served loyally as a prominent member of the Roman Curia, should not becloud their absolute validity by ancient English law and usage.
