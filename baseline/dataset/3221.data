WELL, I'm just back from Tiffany's big bash. It's been 25 years since we finished high school and Tiffany says, ''Let's forget the reunion and just have a party and hang.'' And her big idea was: do the whole 90's theme. So 'stalg!

It was my first trip back to Terra in 10 years, and Tiffany had all kinds of neat stuff I hadn't seen. The induction table, of course, that heats up the food on the plates. And you can look down and see different scenes. Sky. Forest. Brook. I go, Neat, but spare me the underwater Caribbean view if you serve sushi.

When we sat down, there was this cute little Pikachu scooting around that I find out is the saltshaker, and Jigglypuff is the pepper. And every time I dribbled something, a little Tasmanian Devil crumbot zipped by and there was this whishy sound. And then who arrives but that Tracy, who I still hate, and the first thing she says, like she was still the snotty head cheerleader, was, ''So where have you been? I thought you'd left the planet?'' Not even knowing, you know? And I'm like, Well, du-uh, exactly.

Snapped her righteously!

I have to admit she had a point. We really are out of it on the Big Can. But living here is all right. I know they make fun of us, but we laugh at them, too. We call them Aussies, 'cause they're down under. Actually it's more 90's on the Can -- or Oneilia, as absolutely nobody calls it, after the nutty professor who first scoped out the Lagrange points here as the neatest spot for the big space station -- than anywhere on Terra. They had to give it that cute look to get people here. Hired the same team that did that old theme park or whatever it was, Celebration, to make it as Terran as possible.
