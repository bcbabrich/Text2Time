But victory on Rugby Road came at a price. While recognizing the clear gain of a modest heroin bust, many there say that the aggressive tactics used against Mr. Sierra -- and others -- have too often swept up innocent bystanders, too often increased tensions in the neighborhood, too often left them feeling as if police officers had no sense of proportion.

The major sentiment on this two-block stretch of Rugby Road near Midwood, expressed by two dozen people who were interviewed, is that the New York Police Department has in some fundamental way misunderstood what they expect from law enforcement. They describe a police precinct that mindlessly imposes the mores of Mayberry on what is a classic rough-and-tumble Brooklyn neighborhood -- working class, Democratic, ethnically dazzling, full of swaggering, striving characters who are not greatly shocked by a little human vice.

They describe officers swooping into the neighborhood like urban warriors, watching residents from rooftops, circling in unmarked cars and surveillance vans, seemingly oblivious to the rhythms of the neighborhood: who just moved in, who is home from college, who has a bad temper. Residents say the police never seem to know. Yet at the same time, sometimes comically, every scarf is a gang color, every neighborhood scuffle a prelude to gang warfare, every neighborhood nickname a menacing gang moniker. ''Wear a little bit of gold, they ask you questions,'' said Royale Gibbs, 21, who lives on Rugby Road.

Almost every black or Hispanic teenager on the street has a story of being stopped and frisked One teenager, asked how many times he had been stopped in the last year, started counting with the fingers on one hand, then moved on to his other hand, then went back for round two on the first hand before giving up altogether because his friends were laughing so hard at his misfortune.

They howl in laughter as they recite, in perfect unison, the phrase they hear all too often from police officers -- ''You fit the description'' -- and they tell stories of being ticketed for spitting, for riding bicycles on the sidewalk.
