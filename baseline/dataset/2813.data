Vivendi's American entertainment assets include film and television studios, the USA and Sci-Fi cable channels, and an interest in the Universal theme park business. Those assets, known as Vivendi Universal Entertainment, include the Universal Music business, though the music company is not for sale.

NBC has long been Vivendi's favored bidder, despite the fact that its offer includes little in the way of cash, because of General Electric's strong management reputation. NBC is offering Vivendi a partnership in a combined NBC-Universal entertainment conglomerate, in which it could sell its stake over a period of time or possibly through an initial offering of the unit. By agreeing on a deal without any cash now, Vivendi would be betting that NBC's management will help raise the value of the combined unit so much that it is worth waiting to cash out later.

Mr. Bronfman's group, on the other hand, would buy a majority stake in Vivendi's entertainment assets -- with at least $8 billion in cash -- valuing the entire company at a little more than $12 billion, but less than the $14 billion V9ivendi is said to be seeking.

Mr. Bronfman spent the day yesterday in conference calls with Vivendi board members and executives, hoping to leverage his old relationships with them in a way to induce the company to reconsider his proposal. Among others, Mr. Bronfman is said to have a longstanding relationship with Paul Fribourg, chief executive of an agribusiness company, the ContiGroup Companies, who was named to the Vivendi Universal board last year. Mr. Fribourg is also close to Jean-Ren√© Fourtou, Vivendi's chairman, and sometimes advises him on dealings in the United States.

But Mr. Bronfman's hard-charging negotiating tactics may have backfired. According to the executives, recent comments of his quoted in press accounts that were critical of NBC's offer enraged many members of Vivendi's board and especially provoked the ire of Mr. Fourtou.

On Thursday, Mr. Bronfman, who remains a large shareholder in Vivendi, told The Financial Times that a deal between Vivendi and NBC would be ''exactly the wrong outcome,'' adding that NBC executives ''have never run a studio, an entertainment cable network or a theme park.''

If the decision goes NBC's way, tomorrow's board meeting may end an almost yearlong competition for the Vivendi Universal assets. Beyond NBC and Mr. Bronfman's group, as well as Liberty Media, Viacom and MGM, expressions of interest have come from the Comcast Corporation and from a group headed by the investor Marvin Davis.

But if talks with NBC drag on, the uncertainty could affect Vivendi's underlying business. Just last week, Ron Meyer, the president of Universal Studios, acknowledged that the auction process was taking something of a toll within Universal.
