SUNDAY PUZZLE — A very literal puzzle today from Matt Ginsberg, where the circled squares do exactly what the entire phrase describes. I do love an obedient crossword puzzle.

In the 11 theme entries, Mr. Ginsberg CALLs BACK(ward), SPLITs a SECOND, tears TO SHREDS (inside the base phrase TORN TO SHREDS) to shreds, MINCEs MEAT, takes the word DRIFT APART, SCRAMBLEs EGGS by anagramming them, and so on. I won’t spoil all the fun for you. Just remember to do what the base phrase tells you to do, and you will be just fine.

Clue of the Day for me was “Something to pay through?” which totally made the partial THE NOSE better.

Let’s hear from Mr. Ginsberg:

Constructor’s Notes:

It’s always interesting to see what happens to my puzzles between submission and appearance. On this puzzle, I clued all the horizontal words with circles as — SMALL SPOILER ALERT — simply [See circled letters]. But Will decided to make it a bit easier. I’m not sure who was right; my clue was used in a similar “Kangaroo words” puzzle in the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament one year, although that puzzle was somewhat more straightforward, cluing, for example, “israELi AirLine” as [See circled letters]. So this would have been a bit trickier. I thought of the theme itself while sitting in church one Sunday. I spent the rest of the service trying to think of examples to use. This was good because I stayed awake but bad because I didn’t pay attention to the sermon. There was no test afterward, so it all worked out O.K.. Meanwhile, I seem to be losing my touch a bit on the cluing side, as many of the clues that I thought were clever or topical didn’t make the editorial cut. I used [Seahawks’ star Marshawn] for 21-Down and [Berry, repeatedly] for 44-Down. I used [Disney actor] for 67-Down in light of the (fairly) recent film. Perhaps I am simply too old to recognize topical when I see it. (I must confess that I transitioned from one A.C.P.T. age division to another a couple of weeks ago.) Not that I will ever compete, of course. And Dr.Fill remains comfortably in the “Juniors” bracket. If you want to see Dr.Fill solving today’s puzzle, here it is. I apologize for all the video flashing and whatnot; it’s courtesy of my Mac’s upgrade to Yosemite. I’ll try and track it down before the next tournament. Not surprisingly, Dr.Fill does pretty well on this puzzle, since all of the fill consists of actual words or phrases. It makes a few mistakes early on, but it has no trouble correcting them. The solution is found in well under a minute, but it then spends bit of time checking its work and looking for a theme or rebus possibility before announcing that it is done. Correctly solved in a bit under two minutes. I hope everyone enjoyed the puzzle!

Let’s say THANK U to Mr. Ginsberg and move on to the Monday puzzle.
