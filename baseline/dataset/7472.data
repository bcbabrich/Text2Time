WASHINGTON, July 31 —Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy would like to be Secretary of State now that the VicePresidency has been foreclosed to him.

This is the consensus of several close friends and associates of Mr. Kennedy after President Johnson's statement yesterday that the Attorney General and others of Cabinet rank had been eliminated from consideration for the second spot on the Democratic ticket.

Mr. Kennedy, his friends say, is exerting no pressure to obtain the State Department post. But they say he has let it be known at the White House and to a small circle of intimates that if he is to remain in Government, he would prefer to serve in a high capacity in foreign affairs.

There have been conflicting reports that Secretary of State Dean Rusk would resign at the end of the year and that he would continue to serve another Johnson Administration, “as long as the President wants me.”
