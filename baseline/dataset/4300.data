Two weeks ago, when Sunset Park residents heard that the new captain of the 72d Precinct, Thomas Palazzo, was slated to be transferred, they immediately began planning a way to keep him.

In his first three months, community leaders say, the captain had begun improving the previously strained communications between the residents and the police.

"The community wants the relationship to be a partnership," said Councilwoman Joan Griffin McCabe, whose district includes Sunset Park. "I think people feel that kind of confidence in Palazzo."

Residents flooded police officials with telephone calls and wrote a letter to the Police Commissioner, William J. Bratton, in support of the captain. They also planned a demonstration in front of the precinct house. The precinct also includes Windsor Terrace.
