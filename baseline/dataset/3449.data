As an adult, Ms. Lord has kept Golf Cottage, a small, 19th-century house across a road from the nine-hole golf course on the Winterthur property. She asked her father to leave it to her instead of the large house he built to move into when the mansion became a nonprofit museum in 1951.

On a low butler's table in the tiny living room was a florist's arrangement of flowers that Winterthur's publicity agent had had sent for the interview. ''I didn't get around to tearing that up,'' she said.

''I like everything plain,'' she said, asked about a handful of fresh daffodils in a teacup on the windowsill. ''The furniture? It's nothing. Most of it came from Lord & Taylor.''

If objects tell stories, for all of the magnificence of Winterthur, Mr. du Pont's relationship with his daughter was thinly furnished -- a man with 58 sets of china who recorded in detail his table settings for lunch and dinner for 50 years but found it hard to choose words for his children.

''He almost never spoke,'' said Ms. Lord, who worked with archives at Winterthur and cases of correspondence to construct her parents' half of her childhood. ''He was a very sort of kindly person, but he was not intimate.''

As is clear to a visitor, Mr. du Pont saved much of his affection for things.

''After my father died, there was an Oriental rug that wound up in Connecticut, in my house, which I thought was very pretty,'' Ms. Lord said. ''One day I noticed that sewn into one of the corners, which said 'Albany' -- that was my room -- was, 'When Miss R. E. is in residence.' That was me. Ruth Ellen.'' Her father had what he considered ''an inferior rug,'' Ms. Lord said, put down when she was expected home. ''Obviously my father had a terrific distrust of children, and he thought I was going to ruin everything, so the good stuff was apparently moved out when I was there.''

Golf Cottage was empty when Ms. Lord was a child at Winterthur. She went there, with her nurse, to row on the pond and catch tadpoles. As a girl, she sat inside to smoke cigarettes ''with pals,'' as she put it.
