New York City this week prepared for the first return of its native-son president since he entered the White House, and the many disruptions sure to appear in his wake, even as the visit earned an asterisk on Tuesday with the disclosure that he would not be staying at Trump Tower, or in the city at all.

Earlier in the week, flight restrictions announced by the Federal Aviation Administration indicated that President Trump would spend Thursday night in the city after a dinner reception aboard the Intrepid aircraft carrier on the West Side of Manhattan. He would then travel the next day to his country house in New Jersey, at the Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster.

But new restrictions announced Tuesday showed Mr. Trump heading straight to Bedminster from the Intrepid.
