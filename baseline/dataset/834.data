GUETTEL--Mary Rodgers. The Dramatists Guild mourns the passing of our friend and colleague, Mary Rodgers. A Guild Council member for nearly fifty years and the daughter of one of the Guild's past presidents, Richard Rodgers, Mary had a lifetime of involvement with our organization, and her intelligence, generosity and fierce support of her fellow writers will always be remembered and appreciated. As a writer who had the pleasure of working with her (on Working), I can attest to her talent, creativity and good humor as a collaborator. Our deepest sympathies to her son, Guild member Adam Guettel, and to all her family, friends and loved ones at this time. Stephen Schwartz, President The Dramatists Guild of America
