FROM far below, from the field of dreams, came the cadence of summer, the pop of ball smacking catcher's mitt, the crack of wood against horsehide.

It was one of those rare New York events, a day game at Yankee Stadium, and the charm was divine. There was the pungent smell of hot dogs, the bark of a peanut salesman, the sea-lion roar of fans letting loose all the emotion they have struggled to hold in elsewhere.

Leroy Abraham, known as R.J., watched and enjoyed, but saw little. The 9-year-old boy could see neither ball nor players. He didn't know the field was green, much less what the color green looks like. His eyes could only discern that the sun popped through the clouds. It hurt.

Ed Roach, an adult who can see, sat next to R.J. to field questions that often came with trick hops and a giggle. Mr. Roach first explained to the boy where he was sitting, "about four or five stories high," he guessed.
