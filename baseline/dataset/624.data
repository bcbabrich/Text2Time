A longtime leading operative for Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton will join Priorities USA Action, the dominant “super PAC” that will seek big-ticket donations to finance what is expected to be the long and expensive presidential campaign of Mrs. Clinton.

The move by the operative, Guy Cecil, was described by three people familiar with the discussions as a brushback to Jim Messina, President Obama’s campaign manager in 2012 and now the co-chairman of Priorities’s board.

Mr. Cecil, who had been a top contender to run Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, had long been expected to sign on to the PAC, which will rev up its fund-raising efforts as Jeb Bush’s super PAC has already kicked into overdrive.

It is not yet clear exactly what role Mr. Cecil, whose move was first reported by The Washington Post, will play at the PAC. Priorities was dormant during the 2014 mid-term elections and starts out behind in the money race to several super PACs supporting Republican candidates.

But officials involved with the group are aware that they need to begin fund-raising aggressively, as Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, and other Republicans rake in major contributions to their own super PACs.

Mr. Cecil, a favorite of Bill Clinton’s, is a Clinton loyalist coming into a role that initially was supposed to be played by John D. Podesta. But Mr. Podesta went to the White House to work for Mr. Obama, and then became Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman.

At the same time, Mr. Messina, who has been viewed with suspicion for years by many of Mrs. Clinton’s advisers, had become more representative of the super PAC than some of her allies were comfortable with.

In recent months, Mr. Messina and David Brock, Mrs. Clinton’s staunchest defender and the founder of Media Matters, had a public fight that prompted Mr. Brock’s resignation from the Priorities USA board. (He has since reopened discussions with the board.)

Lately, the Clinton campaign has started to signal to donors that Priorities is, as one person briefed on the pitch put it, “the preferred super PAC” to help support her bid for the White House. But there has been little specificity beyond that.

At the same time, Mrs. Clinton has held a series of fund-raisers in New York and Washington this week as she builds the “Hillstarters” program that requests that donors raise $27,000 for the campaign (or the maximum of $2,700 allowed in a nominating contest from 10 supporters).

Next week, Mrs. Clinton will host a discussion in Nevada and will attend fund-raisers in Los Angeles, where Democrats who were split between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama in 2008 have expressed early support for her 2016 bid. Meanwhile, senior campaign staff members have been on a road show across the country to explain the campaign’s strategy and approach to prospective donors.

In February, tensions between Clinton loyalists and former Obama aides erupted, and Mr. Messina’s allies worried that a strategist who was closer to Bill and Hillary Clinton would replace him.

Mr. Cecil, who was previously the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, had been widely expected to be that strategist. It is unclear what his role will mean for Mr. Messina and the existing leadership at the super PAC, including Buffy Wicks, who serves as executive director. A spokesman for the group declined to comment. Mr. Cecil did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

One Democrat close to the talks to bring Mr. Cecil into Priorities called him as “loyal to the Clintons as they are to him — he is a Clinton person, and funders need that.” The Democrat was quick to describe Mr. Cecil and Ms. Wicks as a “team.”

Another Clinton loyalist, Harold Ickes, who was an original adviser to Priorities in 2012, has stepped up his role recently, according to people involved with the group. Mr. Cecil is also a former employee of the Dewey Square Group, and a founding partner of the group, Charlie Baker, was just named Mrs. Clinton’s chief administrative officer.

Mrs. Clinton has made campaign finance reform one of the “four fights” of her presidential campaign, vowing to get unaccountable money out of politics. When stopped on the campaign trail in Iowa last month and asked by Post reporters about the role of Priorities, Mrs. Clinton shrugged.

“I don’t know,” she said.
