WHEN I was a young boy in Japan, I used to watch American cowboy movies starring John Wayne, Gary Cooper and Richard Widmark. At that time, the United States was a kind of dream. There was a romance to Western movies like ''Shane,'' ''High Noon'' and ''My Darling Clementine.'' It was very clear that the good guys always win. That seemed similar to an idea in Japan -- the importance of discipline and duty -- but in a more modern way.

Some kids fantasize about another country. In Japan, you drink green tea, but in ''Rawhide,'' the guy drank coffee in a tin cup. That's when I started drinking coffee.

And I made that cup! I used a milk can and I attached a handle to it and I had instant coffee. So my love for coffee started as a dream, but brewing and collecting it has become my traveling habit. I've been to Indonesia, Brazil, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Puerto Rico -- all places where they have extremely good coffee.

Another passion of my youth was photography. My father was a shutterbug and had all kinds of cameras when he was young. As a soldier in China during World War II, he took many pictures -- not wartime pictures but pictures of people and temples and the Great Wall. He printed the pictures without electricity, using the light of the moon.
