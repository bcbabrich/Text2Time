LOS ANGELES, Feb. 28 - An hour after the last of the golden statuettes had been handed out at the 77th Academy Awards, transforming the lives of several honorees for the better, a similar shift was taking place at Morton's, where Vanity Fair has given its Oscar night party for 12 years.

During the televised ceremony, this restaurant was tame by Hollywood standards: Kirk Douglas stared up at the ceiling as if contemplating a bon mot from one of his dinner companions, the novelist Jackie Collins.

But moments later, when the awards ended, tables were whisked away, and a swarm of people suddenly filled the cavernous restaurant and a tent pitched behind it. It was as if the rich and famous were all given the secret Vanity Fair alert and gathered together, like silvery salmon swimming upstream -- in their feathers and jewels, with sweeping trains and cropped furs -- sharing celebrity secrets in the murky post-Oscar night.

"The Vanity Fair party is as if they let the animals out of their cages, at least for a couple of hours," said the photographer Todd Eberle. He was correct in the sense that major stars like Tom Cruise, who showed up in a Ducati motorcycle jacket, and Cate Blanchett, carrying her statue for best supporting actress, gadded about without the aid of the customary band of handlers. And he was also correct metaphorically, since when it came to dishing about red-carpet fashion, the proximity to such raw meat meant that the claws came out.
