IN "Baseball Without Me," an essay that appeared in last Sunday's New York Times, Fay Vincent made a case for the need for a baseball commissioner, a position that has not been filled since he was deposed in a bloodless coup by the owners one year ago.

The fact is, the commissioner of baseball had become like the Queen of England, but without a handbag. And except for the pomp and ceremony, he hasn't been missed.

This isn't meant from a personal standpoint, because Vincent is a decent and charming and delightful man -- the last of the romantics -- but in his role of commissioner he was a figurehead, whether he realized it or not. Just as were his predecessors, every single one of them, except for the first, Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, the one and only hardball czar.

And the moment, or moments, that each commissioner tried to assert some independence that might impact negatively on one or more of the owners -- that is, doing something that might cost them money -- each one eventually experienced a similar fate, except for Bart Giamatti, who died after nine months in office. Each served at the whim of the owners, though they strutted and displayed their all-powerful mythology before the fans and news media.
