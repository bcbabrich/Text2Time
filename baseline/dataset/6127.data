Ailey and Ellington could start any party off at a high level and with “Night Creature” they opened the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater season last night in a shower of good feelings. The City Center 551.11 Street Theater had a festive .atmosphere that permeated the whole program. There were lots of things to celebrate and the company showed its best performing manners.

It took Alvin Ailey 20 years to decide to choreograph ‘Night Creature,” which was composed in 1955. But the result was the product of care and concern. It was one of the important steps that paved the way for the Duke Ellington Festival that celebrated the composer's talent during the bicentenial year. Mr. Ailey has selected several of Ellington's scores to work with over the years but showed a marked rapport with this one.

The voluptuous woman who led the company on the serpentine chase was Sarita Allen, twisting and turning from one admirer to another. Sociability became a predatory exercise as she first linked herself with Dudley Williams and passed him by for a dalliance with Melvin Jones. The switch back to Mr. Williams was carried out as easily as flicking off a switch. There was heartlessness in the dance but the energy covered up its casual toying with human affections. Everyone knew that it wasn't a kid's game, though seemed like one at times.

Sara Yarborough made it clear that she was home and happy in her first appearance with the company since her return. The occasion was the edgy duet with the logical but convoluted name, “The Time Before The Time After (Arter The Time Before).” Prizes should be awarded for being able to say it correctly three times in succession or even just once.
