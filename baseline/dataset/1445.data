American actors have often profited from doing television commercials abroad, but one such spot promoting tourism in the coastal Marche region of Italy, scheduled to begin broadcasting in early January, has thrust Dustin Hoffman into an unexpected controversy. The two-time Oscar winner is being criticized for “butchering” the Italian language in his recitation of “L’Infinito,” a poem by the 19th-century Italian writer Giacomo Leopardi, a native of Marche, which lies on the Adriatic between Rome and Bologna.

A critic in the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera praised Mr. Hoffman for his “commitment,” but also complained of “the astronomical distance” between his pronunciation and “the Italian ear,” adding that “he stumbles on the eternal words” of one of Italy’s most revered lyrical poets. A preliminary version of the advertisement has been put up on YouTube, and there the criticisms have been even more severe. “Dustin Hoffman and the Marche go together like the Dalai Lama doing a spot for Las Vegas,” one viewer wrote.

The harsh comments have also targeted the governor of the region, Gian Maria Spacca, who has responded by saying that the version of the commercial available on YouTube is only preliminary and may yet be revised before it goes on television. “The difficulty that Hoffman finds in the recitation could symbolize the more universal one of coming closer to an unknown culture,” he told Corriere della Sera. Mr. Hoffman was not immediately available for comment.

Correction: January 2, 2010

An earlier version of this blog post misspelled the first name of the poet Leopardi. It is Giacomo, not Giacamo. It also misspelled the name of the Milan newspaper whose critic praised Mr. Hoffman. It is Corriere della Sera, not Corriere della Serra.
