New York State's highest court yesterday upheld the State Constitution's requirement that judges retire at the end of the year they turn 70 years old.

In a unanimous decision, the Court of Appeals ruled that laws differentiating on the basis of age, rather than such factors as race or religion, need only serve a legitimate state interest to be sustained. And mandatory retirement laws for judges, the court held, ''manifestly have a rational basis.''

As a result of the decision, at least 22 judges who turned 70 in 1984, including four Civil Court judges in New York City who filed the court challenge, retired last night. In some cases, their successors had already been elected, and the Appeals Court's rapid disposition of the case was designed to prevent confusion.

Supreme Court Ruling Voided

The court heard arguments in the case in a rare Saturday session last weekend, less than two weeks after a justice of State Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled that the provision violated Federal constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection of the laws.
