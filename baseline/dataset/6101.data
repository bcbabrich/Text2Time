WASHINGTON, Sept. 30—President Carter ordered Assistant Agriculture Secretary Robert H. Meyer today to stop seeking preferential treatment for farmers in California's Imperial Valley, where Mr. Meyer owns or leases more than 2,500 acres of valuable irrigated land.

“I really don't feel that anyone in Government, including myself, should use his official position to pursue a goal that would result in financial advantage or other advantage for a public official,” Mr. Carter told a group of farm writers and editors in the White House Cabinet Room.

The President said that he had no information that Mr. Meyer's actions were illegal. “But I just don't want to have the accusation of impropriety there,” he added.

Mr. Meyer, who was appointed by the Carter’ Administration. conceded earlier this week that he had been talking with the White House, with the Interior Department and with area Congressmen urging them to seek an exemption for the Imperial Valley from a 1902 law limitIng ownership of land using federally supplied irrigation water to 320 acres for a farmer and his wife.
