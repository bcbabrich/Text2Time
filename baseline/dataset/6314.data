??el Myers. ??e ski‐minded meteorologist at Penn State University, predicted yesterday that a sizable snowstorm would hit the metropolitan New York area starting at dawn tomorrow. He said the chances of it materializing were about 90 per cent.

“If it arrives,” he continued, “it should provide more than enough snow to keep ski operators within a 90‐mile radius of the big city digging out. The snowfall could amount to more than 12 inches.”

Myers is in the business of forecasting snow and cold weather. Several dozen ski area operators from Maine to Georgia pay him to provide advance warning of snow, and he Is particularly adept at predicting Impending subfreezing temperatures.

“Ski resorts with artificial snow machines are the ones that find my services most valuable,” he, explained yesterday. “If operators know the temperature is not going to drop below 32 degrees on any given night, they don't have to keep their snow‐making crews around and pay them overtime — sometimes time and a half.”
