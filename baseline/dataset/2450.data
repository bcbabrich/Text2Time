GRAND BLANC, Mich., July 31 - Vijay Singh arrived on the sun-splashed first tee at Warwick Hills Golf & Country Club with a five-stroke lead in his back pocket, a margin that golfers love and loathe just the same.

There is pressure from playing ahead on the PGA Tour, where collapses become instant legend, stories told as both cautionary tales and punch lines.

But on a golf course comfortable to his eye, and with an agreeable putter in his bag, Singh kept his golf ball out of danger Sunday to win the Buick Open for the third time, defeating Tiger Woods and Zach Johnson by four strokes.

Singh, who also won here in 1997 and 2004, shot a two-under-par 70 to finish at 24-under 264 for the tournament, a sprinter's pace that no competitor could match.
