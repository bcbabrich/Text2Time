TWO hotels are already operating adjacent to the PNC Bank site and three more are nearing completion nearby, part of an 80-acre site dubbed Airport Interplex. Extended Stay America is adding 140 rooms and will be joined by a 140-room Hampton Inn and a Studio Plus property with 85 rooms, said Jerry Segal, senior vice president of Korman Commercial Properties Inc. Other off-airport lodging includes Embassy Suites, Marriott, Westin and Days Inn.

''These are replacing lots of rooms that were very old, said Mr. Segal. ''They can support the convention center because they're so close to downtown with the Eastwick rail station.''

Michael G. French, a principal with Coopers & Lybrand LLP in Philadelphia, said aging hotels near the airport and the nearby sports complex have been renovated thanks to capital programs by hotel chains like Promus Corp. and HFS, which recently purchased properties, or chains that own hotels there.

''The airport market in Philadelphia even in the worst of times always operated at healthier occupancy levels than Center City or other surrounding markets, largely because for a long time it was under-supplied compared to other airport markets,'' said Mr. French.

''In 1991-92, the hotels were being operated by asset managers on behalf of banks or going through restructurings, but even then the airport markets did well. The average occupancy is close to 80 percent, and for that market it's at capacity because things are always soft on Sunday nights. Commercial travelers are increasingly inclined to come in, have a meeting and get out.''

In 1996, the Airport Council International reported Philadelphia had 1.6 million inbound and outbound international travelers, a 27 percent gain over the year before. And US Airways, the dominant airline serving Philadelphia, intends to improve both its service and facilities here. Nevertheless, many Philadelphia-area travelers depart from Newark or New York airports because of a limited number of international departures.

Construction is under way in two of the airport's five terminals to add moving sidewalks and a 45,000-square-foot retail mall. In addition, the airport has announced a $300 million expansion of its international terminal. And US Airways has disclosed plans for a new commuter-flight facility, the addition of flights to Amsterdam and increased service to Frankfurt, Rome, London and Paris, among other destinations.
