With NATO holding major exercises in this country, alliance commanders seem reasonably confident that their forces have the capacity to engage and halt an initial conventional attack on Western Europe. The immediate problem, they suggest, would be holding off the subsequent waves of attackers. The commanders, who spoke in separate interviews in mid- September, said that if there should be a Soviet attack on Western Europe, the second wave of attacking divisions would be supported by surface-to-surface missiles and would have ample air support from bases in East Germany and Poland.

New surveillance systems, the officers said, would enable the Western alliance's air forces to strike the missiles, air bases and the second attacking wave, referred to as ''follow-on'' forces. The problem, as it is seen by ground commanders, is the availability of air resources.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's military priority in the event of aggression will be air superiority over the Soviet Air Force. Although the air forces work closely with ground units, commanders said they would be insistent that before anything else, such as bombing enemy missile sites, they must attain superiority in the air. Reinforcements Are Key Factor

The key factor is the arrival in time and in strength of reinforcing squadrons from the United States and their deployment on NATO airfields. Once there, with air superiority won, they can start to deal with the follow-up forces and their missile and air support.
