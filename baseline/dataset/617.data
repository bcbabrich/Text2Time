SATURDAY PUZZLE — Rules are made to be broken. If this puzzle by Barry C. Silk had a theme, that’s pretty much what it would be.

Broadly speaking, it’s considered poor form to repeat a word, or come close to repeating a word, in the construction of a crossword puzzle, but in this case it’s a credit to both Mr. Silk and Will Shortz that they throw both GOOGLEPLEX and GOOGOLPLEX into a grid in a devil-may-care way and say, “Look! We’re bending the rules and seeing where it takes us.” Both entries are crunchy, they are spelled differently, they each mean totally different things, and personally, I think it makes the grid more interesting this way. In other words, it’s meant to be a design feature, not a flaw. I’m not sure I would want a large dose of this sort of thing in my puzzles, but once in a while there is nothing wrong with it. And it certainly makes the solving experience memorable. Six months from now, you might not remember a Saturday with all different entries, but I am willing to bet that you might say, “Hey, remember that time Barry Silk said GOOGLEPLEX twice?”

What is even more interesting to me is that Mr. Silk was able to fill his grid around this feature fairly well. There is some less-than-desirable stuff, like SDS and some of the abbreviations but, on balance, this worked for me. My gimmes were ORANGEMEN (Syracuse University is my alma mater), ROY ORBISON, ANDIE and GOOGLEPLEX, which gave me a tremendous toehold in the puzzle, especially when you consider that the clues were fairly difficult.

And when I say difficult, what I really mean is beautifully misdirected. I loved “Acronym associated with retirement?” for REM, “Blade handle?” for the otherwise boring entry ATRA, “Series of unknown challenges?” for algebra exam, and even “Place for a decorative clip,” sitting there so quietly, waiting for us to try to cram in BROOCH instead of EAR.

So when you see what looks like a duplicate entry in your puzzle, don’t run for the NEAREST EXIT. Stop and consider whether it’s one of those puzzles that encourages us all to stretch our boundaries, and whether you had fun doing it.

Let’s check in with Mr. Silk:

Constructor’s Notes:

GOOGOLPLEX and GOOGLEPLEX were the seeds for this puzzle. My first attempt at pairing these seeds symmetrically in a puzzle used a different grid pattern with the seeds at 1-Across and the last Across. That puzzle’s submission resulted in a rejection from Will Shortz, but with feedback saying he liked the the pairing of these seeds. So, I decided to try again using a different grid pattern, which was subsequently accepted. I constructed this particular puzzle in December 2013 and, at that time, neither seed had appeared in a New York Times puzzle. This puzzle was accepted in April 2014.

In John Hughes’s 1986 movie, “Pretty in Pink,” Molly Ringwald portrayed the heroine ANDIE, but it was Jon Cryer’s performance as the lovelorn Duckie that stood out — particularly in this scene — and made him a star:
