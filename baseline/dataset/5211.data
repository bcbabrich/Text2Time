John Waters, a self-proclaimed champion of bad taste, has been offending some people and amusing others over the years with such films as ''Pink Flamingos'' (1972), about a contest for the title of ''The Filthiest People Alive,'' and ''Polyester'' (1981), about a middle-class housewife and her awful family. Now he says he is shocked himself at the initial reception for his 11th and latest work, ''Hairspray.''

''We got a PG rating,'' he reported. ''I was expecting a PG-13 or R.'' The New Line Cinema film, scheduled for release on Feb. 26, is ''a satire of two dreaded genres,'' he said: ''the teen flick and the message movie.''

Set in 1962 Baltimore, it's about teen-agers hoping for celebrity on a local television dance show. Among them is the heroine, a fat girl who's always in trouble at school for ''hairdo violations.'' It's also about integration, which, Mr. Waters noted, is not a usual topic of merriment.

''Almost anything can be funny,'' he asserted. ''Hairspray,'' he said, is based on exaggeration, as were his early underground films and his first sort of mainstream one, ''Polyester.'' That movie featured a Waters regular, the hefty female impersonator Divine, as the housewife, who is rescued by Tab Hunter. In ''Hairspray,'' Divine plays two parts: ''a hillbilly mom and a segregation leader,'' Mr. Waters said.

In writing the script, the 41-year-old film maker was inspired, he said, by his favorite 1960's recordings; also by 60's dances that mimed nutty actions. ''There really was the roach, where you squash something and spray your partner,'' he recalled. ''And the bug,' where you jump into a circle and scratch, then throw 'it' to another person and they scratch. I actually did those dances for startled executives at 10 A.M. in their office to make a pitch for the film. They realized I was serious about the project.''

By Waters standards, this is an expensive film - more than $2 million, considerably more than the $300,000 ''Polyester'' and the $12,000 ''Pink Flamingos.'' Also, he says, ''It's not threatening. You're not too afraid to sit near the screen, that you'll catch something.'' Sexism and 'Patti'
