Under pressure at home and abroad, Chancellor Helmut Kohl took a tentative step today toward meeting Poland's demands for a guarantee of its western border once Germany is reunited, but he again declined Warsaw's call for a provisional treaty.

The Bonn Government spokesman, Dieter Vogel, said Mr. Kohl expressed ''full understanding'' at a Cabinet meeting if the West German Parliament and the parliament to be elected in East Germany next month adopted resolutions reassuring Poland that the Germans would make no territorial demands on it now or in the future.

But Mr. Kohl also said the resolution should be like one passed by the West German Parliament last November, which included the proviso that only a unified Germany had the authority to make a final settlement of the borders.

That condition, though legally accurate, has been the main source of the current dispute. While Mr. Kohl has repeatedly insisted that Poland has no reason to fear for its borders, he has added that the question can be settled only by a reunited Germany.
