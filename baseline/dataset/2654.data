Pavel Zoubok Gallery 533 West 23rd Street, Chelsea Through Oct. 9

Adroitly working the vocabulary of contemporary collage, Dodi Wexler cuts, stitches, burns, pastes and punctures old stamps, photographs, maps, handmade Japanese papers, string, wire and miscellaneous snippets to produce a group of intricate creations that seem at times to be almost living organisms.

In fact, many of them relate to living organisms, like "Tiny Crevice Dwellers," a topographical close-up, covered in glass, of a rocky, earthy, pond-y field that serves as turf for miniature butterflies, frogs, snakes and other creatures, all of them handmade. "On the Dri Goat Go," a large, eccentric version of Manhattan, replete with street grid, Central Park, buildings, traffic, people and a string of yellow footprints leading from the Battery to Harlem, presents the borough as a vibrant creature in a universe of its own.

But Ms. Wexler takes less earthy approaches, too, as in "Love Combustion," a wildly exuberant explosion of cut and multicolored papers on a brilliant orange-red cloth, and the wonderfully suave "Sage Firmament," a profusion of sparkling white and gray jewel-like shapes scattered on a black ground and interconnected by an intricate painted web of colored beads. Her varied and venturesome ways with her materials add spice to this improvisational medium. GRACE GLUECK
