For nearly 20 years, Debrah Lee Charatan has tried to stay outside the media spotlight trained on her husband, Robert A. Durst, who is facing trial in Los Angeles in the killing of Susan Berman, his confidante.

But that may be ending.

In a $100 million lawsuit filed Monday in State Supreme Court in Mineola, N.Y., by Carol Bamonte, Mary Hughes and Virginia McKeon, the three sisters of Mr. Durst’s first wife, Kathleen Durst, Ms. Charatan is described as a “coldblooded opportunist” who in cooperation with Mr. Durst “conspired and agreed to conceal the whereabouts” of Kathleen Durst’s body from her family. Ms. Durst disappeared in 1982. Her body has never been found.

Ms. Charatan, a real estate executive in New York, controls her husband’s financial affairs, pays his team of lawyers and is the chief beneficiary of Mr. Durst’s 2003 will and an estate worth an estimated $100 million.

Among the many twists and turns of Mr. Durst’s 35-year tale is the fact that Ms. Charatan, 60, lives with Steven Holm, a real estate lawyer who has worked for Mr. Durst, 74.
