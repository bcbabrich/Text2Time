To the Editor:

Re ''The Lullaby of Broadway,'' by Maury Yeston (Op-Ed, Feb. 28):

I borrow from President Bush's book of logic: musicians are good; producers are evil.

Using computers to replace or supplement tasks that are meant to be performed by artists is truly a sad and pathetic turn of events.

Enough already with the computers. Do they have to be shoehorned into every facet of our lives?

Reducing the number of orchestra pit musicians would be like the National Football League's justifying a seven-on-seven format by proclaiming that ''nobody really needs to see big linemen push each other around.''
