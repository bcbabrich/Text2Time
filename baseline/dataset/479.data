When Peter Pennoyer and Katie Ridder opened their newspaper on Sunday, Feb. 26, 1989, they were surprised by a photograph that appeared on Page 50. It was of them.

Mr. Pennoyer, 31 at the time, and Ms. Ridder, 27, were newlyweds who had attended a benefit for the New York Public Library’s dance collection, held at Lincoln Center. The picture was taken by Bill Cunningham, then 59. It was published in what was very likely Mr. Cunningham’s first official Evening Hours column for The New York Times.

“We heard from so many people, it was ridiculous,” said Mr. Pennoyer, an architect and writer who is now 59. “People from all over seemed to see it. This was before email, and people would actually pick up the phone.”

Ms. Ridder, now 54 and an interior designer, was wearing a dress she had worn to her wedding rehearsal dinner. It was adorned with wire netting and sequins and was designed by Arnold Scaasi.
