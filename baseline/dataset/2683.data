A small plane missing since Saturday and carrying three American soldiers and three civilian crew members, also Americans, crashed into the mountains southeast of Bamiyan, killing all aboard, a police official said. The Associated Press reported later that bodies and wreckage had been found. The plane had been contracted by the United States Air Force to fly supplies to military units around the country.
