His committee spent far too much time early in the hearings proving points that were not in dispute.

Senator Thompson and his staff also proved to be inept at stage management. Before the public sessions started, he told every interviewer that one of his main tasks was to put on a good show so that people would pay attention, but he never did so.

The committee's lawyers questioned witnesses endlessly on minor points. The committee's senators spent day after day delivering monologues serially rather than questioning witnesses. And testimony compelling enough to interest the television networks was often offered at times when it was not convenient for the networks to broadcast it.

On the question of exposing the flaws in the campaign finance system, Senator Thompson contends, with some justification, that the attention generated by his investigation was a factor in the agreement by Republican leaders to allow votes next March on changes in the campaign finance law.

''We've had the first real substantive debate on campaign finance reform in 20 years,'' Senator Thompson said today. ''We played a part in that, and I'm proud.''

But he and the other senators from both parties were never willing to address squarely the fact that the campaign finance system is based on a fiction: the proposition that donors give large amounts of money to politicians and expect nothing concrete in return and that politicians accept money without feeling obligated to give something in return.

The truth is that perfectly legal donations brought out in the hearings -- a $300,000 donation from a wheeler-dealer who wanted to build a pipeline from the Caspian Sea, a $230,000 contribution from Indian tribes that got a favorable ruling from the Interior Department, a $50,000 contribution from a corporate executive who received a phone call from President Clinton -- might be considered bribery or extortion in other walks of life.
