Under the Obama administration, the federal education department offered guidance to universities conducting Title IX investigations of sexual misconduct that they should use a “preponderance of evidence” standard. Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, revoked that guidance, but universities still use a lower standard than the criminal courts.

“Universities like Yale are free to apply any standard within reason,” said Geoffrey Stone, a law professor at the University of Chicago Law School. “Also, the fact that someone is acquitted of a criminal offense does not mean they can’t be held responsible in another context.”

But Andrew T. Miltenberg, an attorney with Nesenoff & Miltenberg LLP in New York City who has represented many students accused of sexual assault, said the low legal standards and the lack of safeguards of these committees make it nearly impossible for anyone to get a fair and reasonable hearing. Mr. Miltenberg is not representing Mr. Khan.

“I think we would all like to believe that he could and will get an unbiased and uncompromised hearing by Yale, but I think it is virtually impossible,” he said.

At the same time, an online petition against Mr. Khan’s being reinstated had drawn more than 77,000 signatures by Thursday.
