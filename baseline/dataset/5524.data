A textile worker was arrested today and charged with kidnapping two 12-year-old girls who turned up Monday after being missing for about a week.

The man, Buford Williams, 23 years old, was also charged with rape.

The authorities said he participated in the week-long search for the girls.

Mr. Williams, who lives in a rural area near here, was arrested after he left his job at midnight at the J. P. Stevens Company textile plant, Sheriff Zollie Compton of Jefferson County said.
