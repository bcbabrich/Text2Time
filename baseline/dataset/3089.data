To the Editor:

While Villa Collina is certainly an example of wealth and ostentation (''Here Comes the Neighborhood,'' cover, March 25), it cannot be compared, as Steward Maimes, a custom home builder does, with the gilded age of the early 1900's. In New York, wealthy families then were constrained by the limits of urban space to concentrate on architecture, durable materials and interior design. A great number of the buildings that went up then have evolved into embassies, cultural institutions, museums and schools. I believe the most appropriate post-residential use for the sprawling Villa Collina would be as a parking garage or a Motel 6.
