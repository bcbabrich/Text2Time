THE Stepping Stones Museum for Children opened here in March after eight years of planning and fund-raising. Its one-story building in Mathews Park contains six galleries that offer about 40 different activities for children up to 10 years old.

To test the museum's mettle, I enlisted two willing judges, my children, Timothy Panzarella, 6, and Anna Panzarella, 12.

This was the third children's museum they have visited in two years. My children are neither sophisticated nor sheltered, although they haven't yet been to Disney World and aren't allowed to own Nintendo, an occasional source of contention in our house. Tim is a fan of ''Star Wars,'' interested in the Civil War and an avid collector of Pokemon cards. When Anna isn't going to school, she's listening to rock music or practicing splits and cartwheels for gymnastics.

Tim gave the museum a solid B. Anna made allowances for the fact that the activities in the museum aren't designed to engage someone quite her age and admitted that some areas bored her. But even she found some exhibits interesting and said that she would also give the museum a B for children younger than she.
