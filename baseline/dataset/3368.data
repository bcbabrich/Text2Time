Given the stress and tension that cling to any airport like clammy weather, hostilities sometimes ensue at the gates. Regularly, we read of entertainers and other worthies who get into hissy fits when treated with insufficient deference at security gates. In September, an entire delegation of indignant North Korean officials en route to New York pulled out of a United Nations summit meeting after what they said was ''rude and provocative'' treatment by security agents working for AMR's American Airlines at the Frankfurt airport.

AHL Services, which employs about 24,000 screeners and other airport security workers through its Argenbright Holdings Ltd. subsidiary, said that it fired three supervisors at its Philadelphia office and cooperated fully with federal investigators after the allegations were first made. The company also said that it was ''deeply embarrassed'' by the situation.

''We isolated the three people in Philadelphia,'' Celeste Bottorff, the vice president for marketing of AHL Services, said yesterday. After the Philadelphia incident, the company said it conducted new background checks and retrained all of its screeners in Philadelphia and increased management oversight of airport screening operations nationwide.

The Philadelphia incident fueled efforts by the airline industry to ask that the government take more responsibility for certification of vendors and training and background checking of contract security workers at airports. Since the early 1970's, airlines themselves have been responsible for certifying the companies they hire to provide airport security. But the airlines want the Federal Aviation Administration and the F.B.I. to become more involved in security.

''The industry and the Congress both felt it would help improve the process greatly if the F.A.A. moved toward certifying the screening companies directly in order for them to do business with air carriers,'' said Richard J. Doubrava, the managing director of security for the Air Transport Association, an airline industry trade group. Under proposed legislation, the F.A.A. would oversee training and performance of security contractors, he said, and the F.B.I. would do thorough background checks, relieving the industry of that responsibility.
