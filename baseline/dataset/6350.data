President Georges Pompidou's effort to repair French‐American relations after the strains of the de Gaulle era has been hampered at every stage of his American tour by the disagreement over Mideast policy, and, especially, the unwise French sale of 110 Mirage jets to Libya. The issue tended to overshadoW others of great importance in the official discussions in Washington last week. The protest demonstrations have obscured further the positive aspects of this visit.

President Pompidou was reportedly so upset by his reception in Chicago and by the, prospect of an even more hostile greeting in New York City today that he considered canceling the visit here. This was of ficially denied; but whatever their reservations about French Mideast policy, New Yorkers should surely respect Mayor Lindsay's request that the French Presi dent be treated courteously during his stay in'this city.

In the long view of history, the French‐American differences over the Mideast are unlikely to prove as significant as the increasing area of agreement between the two Governments. As long as General de Gaulle is looking over Mr. Pompidou's shoulder, French re‐entry into NATO's integrated military Struc ture cannot be expected. But, short of, that, the presence of United. States troops in Europe is. Wel comed and more French cooperation with the North Atlantic Alliance is on the way. The French attack on the American dollar is a thing of the past. Ameri can investment in Europe, within limits, is no longer opposed. France no longer proclaims a world mission of opposition to the United States. Attempts to dominate Western Europe alone or through a Paris Bonn axis are ended. Most important, France no longer opposes either the entrance, of Britain into the Common Market or other moves designed to advance Western

New Yorkers who are determined to expreis pub licly their disagreement with France's Mideast policy would do well to keep this larger picture in mind.
