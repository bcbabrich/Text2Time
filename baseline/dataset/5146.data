An investment group led by Sid R. Bass and Lee M. Bass, two members of the wealthy Fort Worth family, has filed for permission from Federal antitrust regulators to raise its stake in the Sensormatic Electronics Corporation to 14.9 percent from 7.8 percent.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Bass group said it holds its stake for investment purposes only but that it intends to vote its current 2.1 million Sensormatic shares in favor of a proposal from a dissident shareholder group for Sensormatic to rescind its ''poison pill'' defensive plan. In an earlier filing, the Bass Group said it might seek to meet with Sensormatic's management to discuss ways to enhance shareholder values. Sensormatic is an electronic surveillance equipment company in Deerfield Beach, Fla.
