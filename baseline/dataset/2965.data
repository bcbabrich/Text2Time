Mr. Daschle, in portraying the Democrats' resolve to cope with injustice, cited the major provisions of a bill dealing with auditing and corporate responsibility, which the Senate will take up next week. The bill, unlike the House version, is not supported by the accounting industry, and Mr. Daschle predicted its prompt passage because public concern about corporate crime is ''skyrocketing.''

The battle over business took an even narrower turn in dueling news conferences in the House. Mr. Gephardt started the duel by announcing that he was filing a discharge petition, a procedure that can compel a vote on a measure, on what he said was a bill to ''stamp out one of the most glaring, unpatriotic examples of corporate malfeasance.'' The bill would eliminate tax advantages for companies that moved abroad.

That issue is a centerpiece only in the Congressional race in Connecticut between Representatives Jim Maloney, a Democrat, and Nancy L. Johnson, a Republican. Mr. Maloney has been making political hay with the issue because of the decision by the Stanley Works in New Britain to make Bermuda its headquarters.

Republicans responded with a proposal by Representative Bill Thomas of California, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, for changes in the tax code so companies would not want to move. Democrats said this was another giveaway, and even Speaker J. Dennis Hastert seemed uncertain whether the Thomas proposal was going anywhere.

In fact, because Republicans sign discharge petitions only under the greatest pressure (as on campaign finance legislation), Mr. Gephardt's effort has no chance of success in compelling a House vote on the Democratic bill. But then the prescription drug bill that the House passed early Friday morning, while dealing with a bigger issue, has no chance in the Senate.

This year, though, bills do not have to go anywhere. Except for necessities like appropriations or raising the limit on the national debt, not only the talk but nearly all the legislating is all about the November elections -- and the vague hope that one party will gain big enough majorities to actually get bills passed.
