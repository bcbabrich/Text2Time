A report on the Huffington Post Web site on Monday said that NBC had selected the correspondent David Gregory to become the permanent moderator of its Sunday morning show, “Meet The Press.” The account did not name any source for the information.

NBC executives said Monday night that no announcement of the replacement for the late Tim Russert was planned for Tuesday, though the executives did not deny that Mr. Gregory might be named to the position at some point. He has been considered the leading contender for the position for some time.

The NBC executives emphasized that no deal had been concluded for anyone to take the position.

Tom Brokaw, who has filled in as moderator since Mr. Russert death, is expected to leave the program sometime this month. President-elect Barack Obama will be the guest on Sunday’s program.
