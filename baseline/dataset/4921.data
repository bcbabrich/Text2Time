A former bank executive who was charged with helping Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos transfer $168 million from the Philippines to the United States pleaded guilty yesterday to mail fraud.

Under a plea agreement, the executive, Rodolfo T. Arambulo, will help the prosecution in its case against Mrs. Marcos, which is expected to go to trial on March 20, Federal officials said.

Mrs. Marcos is accused of pirating the money from the Philippine treasury and investing it in real estate in the United States, including Manhattan. Mr. Marcos, who died last year, was also charged.

Mr. Arambulo's plea came two days after he surrendered to the Federal authorities. Mr. Arambulo, the 57-year-old former president of the California Overses Bank in Los Angeles, could receive a maximum five-year prison term and a fine of $250,000 under the agreement. He will be sentenced by Judge John F. Keenan of Federal court in Manhattan.
