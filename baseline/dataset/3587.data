''The glacier, which covered much of the Northern Hemisphere, reached its final southern limit on Staten Island,'' said Edward Johnson, curator of science at the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences. ''And when it retreated, it left all these boulders, kettle ponds, a network of streams, low hills and marshland.''

To the Leni-Lenape tribe of the Algonquin Nation, the island was called Aquehonga, after the sandy banks of the southern shore. To the Dutch, who first arrived in 1639 and promptly began pushing out the Indians, it was Staaten Eylandt, Island of the States -- the States being the name of the Dutch legislature.

But to the English, who came in large, well-armed vessels in 1664 -- and promptly began pushing out the Dutch -- it was Richmond, in honor of King Charles II's illegitimate son, Charles Lennox, the Duke of Richmond.

It didn't take long for the English to consummate the island's first real estate deal. ''In 1670,'' said Richard Dickenson, the Staten Island Borough Historian, ''Governor Thomas Lovelace purchased the island from the Indians.''

''They had a different concept of what selling land was,'' Mr. Dickenson said. ''To them, everybody owned the land; nevertheless, they went along with the charade.'' The price: an unknown quantity of coats, kettles, guns, axes, knives and wampum.

In 1676, the tiny village of Tottenville at the southern tip of the island -- in fact, the southern tip of New York State -- was first settled. And a century later, on Sept. 11, 1776, two months after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, three members of the Continental Congress -- Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and Edward Rutledge -- met with British Admiral Lord Richard Howe in what is now called the Conference House in Tottenville in an attempt to avert the Revolution. They didn't.

In the 1800's, village industries cropped up throughout South Richmond: fishing in Tottenville; brickmaking, because of the fine clay, in Charleston; oystering, particularly by a group of free blacks from Maryland and Virginia, along the western shore in Rossville. And that configuration of isolated towns, with a few roads and farms between, would hold as the pattern for development -- or, more precisely, limited development -- well into the 20th century.
