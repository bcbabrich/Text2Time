The number of civilian complaints filed against New York City policemen during 1972 has reached a record 3,700, or triple the figure of five years ago.

At the same time, however, the proportion of such complaints leading to a recommendation of formal Police Department charges against the policemen involved is just 2.5 per cent, a new low.

Over the years most complaints have alleged “unnecessary force.” Other complaints charge abuse of authority, discourtesy and ethnic slurs.

Sterling Johnson Jr., executive director of the Police Department's Civilian Complaint Review Board, which processes the complaints, says that the increase in complaints reflects the public's confidence in the board's impartiality.
