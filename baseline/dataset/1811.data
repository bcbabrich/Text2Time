Crews from Waldorf Demolition are just beginning to work on the former Dun & Bradstreet headquarters at 99 Church Street, where Silverstein Properties is planning an 80-story Four Seasons hotel and apartment building.

But the 57-year-old building’s most distinctive feature is already gone.

That was a monumental metal frieze over the front door, showing two allegorical figures in relief — a buckskin-clad frontiersman and a shirtless industrial laborer, holding hands and gazing into one another’s eyes — above fruits, a plough blade, a mallet, a wheel, a sheaf of wheat and this inscription:

Credit. Man’s Confidence in Man. Commercial credit is the creation of modern times and belongs in its highest perfection only to the most enlightened and best governed nations. Credit is the vital air of the system of modern commerce. It has done more — a thousand times more — to enrich nations than all the mines of the world. Quoted from a speech by Daniel Webster in the Senate at Washington, March 18, 1834.

Gary Dombroff, a City Room reader who lives in Brooklyn and passes by 99 Church Street every day on his way to work nearby, drew its disappearance to our attention.

“How ironic that this message about credit is now gone, given the subprime mortgage meltdown and its aftereffects — including possible criminal indictments,” Mr. Dombroff said. “We could use some inspiration from the past about the power of credit.”

Discussions of the frieze have appeared on Curbed and Wired New York. A number of commenters there, including Mr. Dombroff, wondered what happened to the frieze.

It lives on, as a facsimile in the new offices of the Moody’s Corporation at Silverstein Properties’ 7 World Trade Center tower. Moody’s, which was acquired by and later spun off from Dun & Bradstreet, was the last occupant of 99 Church Street, which it sold to Silverstein.

“Moody’s opted for a reproduction rather than the original, which was their right as part of the sale of 99 Church Street,” a spokesman for Silverstein Properties said. “The original was removed by Waldorf and recycled.”
