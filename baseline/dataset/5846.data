A Federal district judge has refused to swear in seven people as United States citizens because they could not speak adequate English, even though they apparently were exempt from the language requirement, an immigration official says.

Judge Kendall Sharp told the Immigration and Naturalization Service that he had refused to grant citizenship to the seven because he did not believe in a law that waives the English-language requirement for immigrants at least 50 years old who have lived in the United States for at least 20 years, according to George Waldroup, an I.N.S. spokesman in Miami.

Other immigrants must be able to speak and write English to become citizens. The seven who were denied citizenship will get another hearing, Mr. Waldroup said.
