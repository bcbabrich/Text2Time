WESTBURY, L. I. — Steve Warrington, a 24 — year — old trainer, hitched up one eighth of his harness‐horse stable at Liberty Bell in Philadelphia one morning a couple of weeks ago and headed for Roosevelt Raceway here with a 3‐year‐old pacer in his van and, as he put it, “dollar signs in my eyes.”

Horses, carrying the hopes of small stables from Caribou, Me., to New Zealand, were leaving the hinterlands of harness racing; Warrington, whose father, Walter, had never quite made it under the bright lights of Roosevelt and Yonkers Raceways, was hoping that his Mark Forrester would be that which racer dreams are made of.

They wouldn't let Warrington and his horse on the New Jersey Turnpike.

A 2½‐hour trip became a four‐hour excursion through the back roads of New Jersey. “I'd never seen such places I went.” said Warrington, but he'll make the trip again tomorrow as he has for each race his colt has entered.

This time, though hopes of victory have increased, the dollars signs have diminished.

Eight horses, all of whom earned less than $5,000 through last Dec. 15 as 2‐year‐olds, will be racing for a $25,000 purse tomorrow night at Roosevelt, the biggest prize in their young lives. Mark Forrester qualified for this race, the Westbury final of the aptly named Hopeful Series, part two of which will start next week at Yonkers Raceway.
