FLYING solo or in collaboration with other New Vaudevillians like Michael Moschen (in ''Foolsfire'' and ''The Alchemedians''), Bob Berky has proven himself to be an inspired clown. As a performance artist, he evidently has a desire to expand his range into writing and directing. One result of this ambition is ''Traveling,'' an evening of sketches at the Actors Outlet Theater. The show was conceived and directed by Mr. Berky and written by him in collaboration with the National Theater of Woodbee. While awarding Mr. Berky points for earnestness in pursuit of laughter, one must also acknowledge that ''Traveling,'' at least in part, is a jejune journey.

The revue deals at length with such subjects as arrival and departure, methods of transport and, to too great an extent, baggage. This means that the nine actors in the company -none of them in a comic class with Mr. Berky himself - rush back and forth across the stage pretending to be tourists in transit and vehicles in motion.

By design, the show has far more text than Mr. Berky's previous efforts - and the writing puts too much stress on repetition, as in an argument over the relative weight of a single suitcase. Occasionally, the evening diverges from the central issue, as in a long, somber folk story about coyotes, a story that stops the comedy in its tracks.

Visually, there are a few amusing devices, such as a swinging door that acts as a revolving billboard. Every time the door is opened, we see a travel poster illustrating the attraction of a tourist site. The show begins to reveal hitherto hidden comic possibilities when the setting shifts to the Quick Transit travel agency, whose manager, naturally, is named Gloria Mundi.
