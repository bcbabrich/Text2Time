An Indian judge has issued an injunction temporarily barring the Union Carbide Corporation from making any out-of-court settlement with individual victims of the Bhopal gas leak.

The temporary injunction, issued Wednesday by Judge Mahadeo Wamman Deo in Bhopal, was sought by India's Government to block the American company's efforts to bypass the Government in settling claims growing out of the 1984 disaster. Judge Deo said court proceedings would begin July 29 to determine whether the injunction should be made permanent.

His ruling, legal experts said today, means that the Bhopal case is again caught up in a procedural battle having little to do with the accident.

Officials of Union Carbide, at its headquarters in Danbury, Conn., and in India, did not respond to requests for comment on Judge Deo's ruling.
