QUADRACCI - Harry. J.S. Eliezer Associates, Inc. wishes to extend its deepest sympathies to Betty Quadracci, her family and all of the employees of Quad/Graphics, Inc. for the passing of Harry Quadracci, our friend and an industry activist. Our association with Harry Quadracci spans nearly 30 years, both personally and professionally. He was the consummate, innovative businessman, with that special insight into how to make individuals work together to create the largest private printing firm in the world. In addition, he was a tireless philanthropist who supported many worthwhile causes, in Wisconsin and throughout the country. We will miss him dearly, in our everyday working environment and in our hearts.
