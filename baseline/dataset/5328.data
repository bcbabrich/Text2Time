The annual Pulaski Day Parade will begin at noon tomorrow at 26th Street and Fifth Avenue, marching north to 52d Street, then east to Third Avenue. Because of the Jewish holidays of Shemini Atzereth and Simhath Torah, which conclude the harvest festival of Succoth, alternate-side parking will be suspended in New York City on Monday and Tuesday. Other regulations remain in effect.
