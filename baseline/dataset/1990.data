Former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is getting support from some high-flying financiers as he considers whether to run for president in 2008. Data published on Wednesday by PoliticalMoneyLine.com show that contributors to Mr. Giuliani’s presidential exploratory committee, formed in November, include T. Boone Pickens, the Texas mogul who runs the hedge fund BP Capital Management; and Paul Tudor Jones II, the chairman of the hedge fund Tudor Investment Corporation. The fund also got money from Carl C. Icahn, the billionaire investor, filings show.

Mr. Pickens and Mr. Jones were ranked No. 2 and No. 5, respectively, in Alpha magazine’s listing of the most highly paid hedge fund managers of 2005. Mr. Icahn is one of the best-known activist investors on Wall Street.

Mr. Pickens, Mr. Jones and Mr. Icahn each gave $2,100 to the fund, called the Rudy Giuliani Presidential Exploratory Committee, according to PoliticalMoneyLine. (Update: Under campaign finance law at the time of these donations, $2,100 was the maximum an individual could contribute to a candidate in a single election.)

Mr. Giuliani drew a lot of financial support from Mr. Pickens’ Dallas-based firm, BP Capital. Employees there contributed a total of $18,900 to his exploratory fund.

Elliott Associates, a hedge fund founded by Paul E. Singer, one of Mr. Giuliani’s primary fund-raisers, has also been one of Mr. Giuliani’s biggest supporters. Employees of Elliott Associates gave a combined $14,700 to the fund, filings show.

In all, Mr. Giuliani’s fund said it raised about $1.4 million between Nov. 15 and Dec. 31.

In a Jan. 25 article, The New York Times’s Landon Thomas Jr. wrote about the increasing importance of hedge fund money for those with political aspirations:

Hedge fund money, which now exceeds $1 trillion, has emerged in the last several years as a potentially powerful force in politics, as underscored by the significant role it is playing in the presidential aspirations of [Hillary Rodham] Clinton and Mr. Giuliani. During the 2006 election cycle, executives who work at the 30 biggest hedge funds made $2.8 million in contributions to political candidates or party committees, almost double the amount in 2000. Yet it is not just the money they donate directly that makes people in hedge funds attractive to campaigns. They also offer access to other potential donors in the financial world, which in recent election cycles has become one of the biggest sources of political contributions.
