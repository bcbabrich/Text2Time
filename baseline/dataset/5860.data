Negotiations on the acquisition of Continental Healthcare Systems Inc. by the Primark Corporation have been terminated, the companies said.

They said they were unable to agree on the terms of a definitive agreement. In October, the companies agreed in principle for Primark to acquire all of Continental's common shares outstanding for $6.75 a share, or about $21 million.

Primark is a holding company involved in several businesses, one of which is telecommunications service for the health care industry. In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Continental plunged $2.125, to $4.
