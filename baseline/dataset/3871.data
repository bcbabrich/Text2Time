How much do the shim sham and the step-dance have in common? As much as anyone wants them to, to judge by the lively and entertaining ''Afroceltic Connection: Flying Home,'' a program presented by Lincoln Center Out of Doors on Thursday night at Damrosch Park by the Jiving Lindy Hoppers from England, the Sin E band from Ireland and Dianne Walker, an American tap-dancer.

The accent was on fusion, with a vengeance, and most of the time the idea worked. The best numbers were the splashiest. European court dancing became a stylish cakewalk, which in turn became a stylized bout of Lindy Hopping in ''The Breton,'' choreographed by Pepsi Bethel, Frankie Manning and Norma Miller, all American specialists in popular black American dance forms.

Other highlights included the effervescent ''Shim Sham Hornpipe,'' a group piece choreographed by Ms. Walker and Leonard Reed, and ''The Rights of Man,'' a three-part voyage from Irish folk-flavored modern dance to Lindy Hopping via step-dancing, with choreography and restaging by Ciara Gill, George Sullivan, Lee Moats, Dickie Harris and members of the Jiving Lindy Hoppers. Most of the dance numbers, including these three, were set to traditional Irish music.

There were times when the synthesized dance forms were uncomfortably not one thing or another, as in the women's duet from ''The Rights of Man'' and a long solo choreographed and performed by Francis Angol that looked like a vogue-dancer doing the traditional African ostrich dance. And the first half of the evening had an oddly circumscribed feeling. When rain began to fall during the second half, a little much-needed disorder broke through, along with more spirited group tap-style numbers.
