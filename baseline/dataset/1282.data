The N.F.L. will have no trouble playing 18 and even more regular-season games if it can persuade the players to accept an expanded schedule, Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, said Tuesday.

“It’s something we certainly have had the ability to do,” Jones said at a news conference in Dallas. “We’ve had the ability to go to 22 games, had we wanted to as owners without anybody’s approval. We haven’t done that without the approval of players. Certainly, we want players to buy into what we do on a going-forward basis.”

As part of the talks to forge a new labor agreement, the owners have proposed turning two of the four preseason games into regular-season games. The owners argue that adding two regular-season games would generate more revenue through additional advertising, television rights and other sales — money the players would share in.

“They will be paid if the pie grows,” Jones said of the players.



Preseason games are unpopular with many fans, especially season-ticket holders who must buy tickets to the games, in which stars typically play very little.

The players, however, have said that the current 16-game regular season is long enough and that two extra games will lead to more injuries. They may be willing to accept more regular-season games if roster spots are added and postcareer benefits improved.

With the expiration of the current labor deal looming on March 3, Jones said the threat of a lockout was not a bad thing if it prompted labor and management to reach an agreement.

“They’re there for a reason,” Jones said of strikes and lockouts. “The reason is the threat of them will create enough angst and a lot of pressure so there’s enough urgency to get a decision done.”
