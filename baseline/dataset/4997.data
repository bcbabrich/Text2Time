Your name, address and telephone number are no longer yours to give out only as you choose. Direct marketers all over the nation have them and are using them with increasing intensity to sell products and services.

The flood of unsolicited third-class or junk mail and intrusive telephone calls is reaching new heights and a good many consumers are irritated by what they regard as an invasion of privacy. In most cases, the sales pitches are legal and there are no laws, state or Federal, that prevent marketers from legitimately seeking your patronage by mail or phone. And because these techniques are showing better and better results, they are likely to continue to be a major factor in selling merchandise.

Even if you contact the companies offering unwanted material, or take other action to stop calls and mail, you may still be solicited. ''There's no sure method of getting off all the lists,'' said Sara Cooper, a senior program associate of the National Consumers League, a nonprofit organization in Washington.

Of course, not everyone objects to direct marketing. The in-home sales market has grown because more Americans like the convenience of shopping by mail or phone.
