More than 20,000 people sought political asylum in Switzerland last year, the most in one year since World War II, with many coming from Sri Lanka, Zaire and Uganda. Many Swiss contend that people from these countries will never fit into Switzerland's European culture.

The Government proposal would limit registration for nonresident foreign students to those below the age of 16 in private schools and below 22 in universities. The anger that it has provoked was expressed in a weekly magazine, L'Hebdo, which headlined a recent full-page editorial, ''A Stupid Hunt for Foreigners.''

The point the French-language weekly and many educators are trying to make is that ''hunting'' for the kind of foreigners who attend private schools and the nation's universities will do nothing to reduce the number of asylum seekers or foreigners who enter the country as students and then seek work. They say it can only cause serious economic harm, not only to the operators of the schools but to the states where they are situated.

''If you are paying 45,000 Swiss francs a year for schooling, I don't think you are going to go out and try to make some pocket money working as a waitress,'' Mrs. Neri said.

Francis A. Clivaz, president and founder of the College du Leman in Versoix, a suburb of Geneva, said the new law could cut drastically into the 600 million to 700 million Swiss francs the educators and tourist officials estimate private students bring into the country each year in the form of payments for tuition, room and board and spending money.
