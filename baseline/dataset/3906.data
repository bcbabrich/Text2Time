''It is a very, very sticky question,'' a senior Administration official said as the last touches were being put on the Indonesia package this week. ''We can't step into every economic mess. But when the problem of contagion across markets becomes this serious, then it's hard to do what America once did -- regard an economic crisis as a confined event, like a civil war.''

What prompted the Administration to move, officials say, was fear that the instability that first racked Asia, then sped to markets around the globe, could turn into something more virulent. Economists have been talking about the dampening effects that continued turmoil in the Asian markets -- and a slowdown in growth -- could have on American exports. That was certainly a concern, Administration officials say. But it was the least of the worries.

The bigger strategic concerns come in many varieties and cross a number of Washington's bureaucratic boundaries.

The immediate objective of the American action, of course, is what the Treasury calls ''market contagion'' -- the odd ways in which a loss of investor confidence in one nation spreads to others. Often that seems irrational: There is no reason that concerns about Indonesia or Thailand, for example, should rock confidence in Brazil. But currency crises have a way of gathering steam. And in this case, the willingness of governments in Asia to devalue their currencies because their neighbor has -- making their goods more competitive -- has prompted market speculators to suspect that other governments will follow suit lest they be priced out of the export race.

President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina explicitly discussed that issue today when he gathered reporters to say that he had been assured by Brazil's President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, that Brazil would not follow the Thais and the Indonesians.
