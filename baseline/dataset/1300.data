Vernon, Calif., is a bleak, 5.2-square-mile sprawl of warehouses, factories, toxic chemical plants and meat processors that looks like the backdrop for “Eraserhead,” the David Lynch movie set in an industrial wasteland. It has a population of 95 — and 1,800 businesses, drawn by low taxes, lax regulations and cheap municipal power. The tiny city has responded to the threat of being disincorporated with a sophisticated, high-priced battle that has all the trappings of a national campaign.
