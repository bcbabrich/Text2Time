We were loading lunches, rods and tackle into my skiff by the glare of the car's headlights. The weather was deteriorating. I turned on the marine weather on the skiff's radio and learned that we were in a tropical disturbance and that a hurricane plane had been sent out to view the center of it. George Anderson and Jimbo Meador were my companions, two men who never confuse angling with male bonding: fine dining and gentlemanly hours were out the window. We had fueled up at the dock instead of siphoning gas from the rental car with a borrowed garden hose, as George and I had done in the past. We were going to look for tarpon in a new place, a stretch of south Florida beach, a deep pass, broad, sandy banks that looked ready to receive spring migrants. We had a watermelon in the ice box, sandwiches, a couple of gallons of water. With George aboard, this would be all there was to eat until the last drop of gas had been burned looking for fish.

George had tied up a supply of leaders, cautioning us to lubricate our knots with Chap Stick instead of spit. "Use spit and you overheat these co-polymers. You break off a lot of fish." George had been chasing tarpon so long this spring in the Keys that he had tendinitis from pulling up leader knots. Jimbo had never caught a tarpon before and right now it was the only thing in the world he cared about. I had made a blind guess that this area would hold fish, but I wasn't really sure.

I eased the skiff up onto a plane. The quartering chop was coming at us from the southeast and the boat pounded up sheets of spray that stung our faces. I strained into the darkness ahead of the semi-airborne skiff, trying to remember any obstructions that might lie in front of us. "I remember this old boy from Baldhead Island," came Jimbo's Alabama drawl above the wind, "going from Southport across the Cape Fear River headed from Frying Pan Shoals, I guess. . . ."

"What about him?" I hollered.

"Well, he hit something in the dark. Found him dead in his skiff."

I looked even harder into the blackness ahead, picking out a few lighted markers, a few house lights along the shore, the lights of a barge and then a tug. We didn't realize what a lee we'd enjoyed until we got around the island. The wind was gusting up to 25 knots and prospects for fly fishing were bleak.
