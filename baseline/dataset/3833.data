Call it an art diaspora. More than $1 billion worth of ceramics, bronzes, furniture, paintings and porcelains have been flowing out of Hong Kong recently, because residents fear that China may restrict the export of art and antiques after it takes control from Britain on July 1. Chinese officials have said nothing to quell owners' anxieties.

Hong Kong's art collectors are not selling their treasures now, for the most part. Rather, they are sending them for safe-keeping to second homes and art warehouses, especially in Canada and the United States. Or, they are giving them to museums on long-term loans.

The exodus is driving up prices for Chinese art. And it is hastening the decline of Hong Kong and the rise of New York as the center of the China art trade. JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI
