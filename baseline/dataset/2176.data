I’m uncomfortable with the tone of some of the coverage of Bob Woodruff and ABC. Part of it is that the coverage is so largely focused on this being a blow to ABC News — which is true, but seems a bit secondary to the blow to Woodruff himself and his family.

But more important, the backdrop of the reporting sometimes contains the implication that Woodruff’s reporting from Iraq or elsewhere was a business strategy to woo viewers. Look, I don’t doubt that the business side felt that it was good for ratings to have an anchor out in the field — but, above all, it was good journalism.

In my New York Review of Books essay on Darfur, I complained about the trend in TV news of having “breathless blondes reporting on missing blondes.” Woodruff reporting in Iraq was the opposite of that — he may have been a pretty face, but he was reporting on a substantive story that doesn’t titillate but is enormously important for our country. And anchors traditionally haven’t just been airheads who stand on the masking tape as instructed by their executive producers — they’ve also been managing editors of their news shows, and involved in news decisions. That’s proper, but it also means that they need to get out in the field and see for themselves. Woodruff wasn’t simply executing some business side policy when he was injured; he was practicing journalism.

Moreover, there’s a danger of treating Woodruff too lightly simply because he’s so telegenic. Look, this is a guy who speaks fluent Chinese, who lived in China (overlapping in Beijing with me in the late 1980’s), who left a job at a major law firm to become a TV correspondent. I think it’s great that he wanted to do real reporting, and it’s tragic that he was hurt at the beginning (and now, perhaps end) of his anchor career.

I’m afraid all this carping about the damage to ABC will make it less likely that other TV anchors will actually get out in the field as well. (My challenge to Bill O’Reilly to join me in Darfur is still open). Instead of portraying Woodruff as some pawn of business executives, we should be celebrating him for trying, bravely, to go against the grain of today’s TV news shows and commit serious international journalism.
