The sidewalks of New York have their own song. Broadway has several. Well-known plays and movies have been set in or inspired by, among many other New York locations, the Waldorf, the Plaza, Wall Street, Macy's, Yankee Stadium, Tiffany & Company, Katz's Delicatessen and the late Cammareri Brothers Bakery in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn.

But for all its importance to the city over the last 98 years, the subway has been given relatively short shrift by the performing arts. Of course, there are exceptions like ''Take the A Train,'' and ''The Taking of Pelham One Two Three'' and the great scenes in ''The French Connection.'' But the only major Broadway play with subway in the title, ''Subways Are for Sleeping,'' flopped in 1962, and the last big-budget movie set in the subway, ''Money Train,'' did not receive a warm critical reception. (''If this is not the end of the road for the cop buddy movie,'' Roger Ebert lamented, ''maybe it should be.'')

As a hard-working muse and epic urban protagonist, the subway surely deserves far better from the creative community, however, and so very recently some of its New York members have set about trying to redress this wrong.

In May, for example, the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre staged ''theAtrainplays,'' a group of three short musicals and three one-act plays.
