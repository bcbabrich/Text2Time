Roy Jones Jr. is 33 years old and talking as if he will retire by the end of next year. It is not so much the opposition, says the man still described by many as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world. It is his hands. They are still lightning quick, but they are also chronically sore.

''I've got real bad hands,'' Jones said. ''There's a lot of times where I get a guy in a pretty good situation and I've got to chill out. I could knock out a lot of them, but then my hands would be broke up so bad I wouldn't be able to fight no more.''

Jones, the undisputed light heavyweight champion, is 45-1 with 36 knockouts. He is a prohibitive favorite against Glen Kelly of Australia on Saturday night at the American Airlines Arena in Miami.

As Jones's fame has mushroomed, so has his nonboxing schedule. He has played semipro basketball, acted in a movie and become a rap artist.
