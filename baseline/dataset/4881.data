To the Editor: The letter from Harry K. McWilliams (Oct. 27) on being at the North Pole is both quite right and quite misleading or wrong. He refers to hitting "90 degrees north, 180 degrees east and west." He means "90 degrees north."

All of the imaginary north-south lines that determine longitude converge at two points: the north and south poles. Thus Mr. McWilliams might have truthfully stated that he stood at "90 degrees north, with my left shoe in Longitude 82 degrees west and my right shoe, alongside it, in 109 degrees 39 minutes 21 seconds east longitude." Any other numbers, east or west, between zero and 180 would be equally correct.

"Ninety degrees north" says it all. BRUCE P. HAYDEN West Hartford, Conn.
