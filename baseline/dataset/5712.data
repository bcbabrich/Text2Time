''ANCIENT LIVES,'' a four- part series, examines ancient Egypt, a land where the living shared territorial rights with the dead. Apparently, this worked to everyone's advantage. A sense of community led to great art and interesting artifacts. The series begins on Channel 13 at 8 tonight.

The opening program, ''A Village of Craftsmen,'' looks at a settlement in the hills of Thebes. (This is not to be confused with the Thebes in Greece; for one thing, the Thebes in Egypt was older.) John Romer, the host of the series, says we know more about the people who lived in the settlement 3,000 years ago than we do ''about most people in the last century.'' The ancient Egyptians were inveterate scribblers, recording their lives on stone.

Thus Mr. Romer, an Egyptologist, takes us on a tour of the village: Here lived a little old lady who adored a pet monkey; there lived a scribe who wrote love poetry. Mr. Romer scambles up hillsides and over fallen statuary. Sometimes he grows breathless and sometimes his British accent gets in the way. On the whole, however, he is not a bad guide.

Nonetheless, the great appeal here is not the lesson in Egyptology, but the lesson in design. Have the graphic arts improved all that much in 3,000 years? ''Ancient Lives'' indicates they have not. The people in the settlement decorated their own modest tombs with striking pictures, carefully rendered. Even everyday artifacts were made with care. Form, function and esthetic appeal seem to have been given equal weight.
