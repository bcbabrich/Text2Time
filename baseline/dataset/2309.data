A lot of blogs are linking to this attack ad on State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi by the G.O.P. [Capitol Confidential.]

But has anybody actually seen it on TV? [The Daily Politics.]

Huh. So now we can blame Hevesi for terrorism too? [Urban Elephants.]

A plea for perspective: The Wonkster at Gotham Gazette asks, “Is what Alan Hevesi did so bad? Or so different? What’s the alternative?”

Faith-based voting, from Freddy Ferrer: He’s voting for Mr. Hevesi “with the full expectation” that he’ll be replaced as comptroller. “Elections such as this,” he says, are “a leap of faith. But I have a lot faith in Eliot Spitzer.” Do we have many elections like this? He’s not alone, of course. [The Politicker.]

Spin Cycle wonders what happens if this Democratic strategy fails: “What if Hevesi wins big? What if Hevesi tells Spitzer and Silver in January that the people have spoken? What if his lawyers tell Spitzer and Silver that acts he engaged in during his first term can’t be a basis for removal in his second term? What if he goes to court to block them? Everybody may think Hevesi’s finished… except for Hevesi.”

The Newsday blog was also on hand when J. Christopher Callaghan got on the bus.

And, don’t miss our mini-profiles of the other candidates for comptroller:

Julia Willebrand, The Green Party.

John J. Cain, Libertarian Party.

Willie Cotton, Socialist Workers Party.
