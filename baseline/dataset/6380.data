After Mr. Nixon's speech, Senator John Sherman Cooper, Republican of Kentucky, who has been lining up with the opposition, said, “The most hopeful thing in the speech was the statement that once the objective of neutralizing the sanctuaries was achieved, then our troops would be with drawn.”

“I understand the short‐term purposes to do this before the rainy season and to gain some time,” he contnued. “But never theless I think the risks of escalation and prolongation of our presence in South Vietnam are much greater than the pos sible benefits of that action.”

In contrast, his Republican colleague from Kentucky, Sen ator Marlow W. Cook, com mented: He's shown more honesty than anyone involved in this thing.”

Some of the strongest Re publican criticism came from Senator George D. Aiken of Vermont, who was the Senator referred to by the President as warning that the administra tion, by its actions in Cam bodia, was in danger of jeopar dizing Republican chances in the November elections.

‘Taking a Long Chance’

“I think the President is tak ing a long chance,” Senator Aiken said. “If his action is successful and American lives can be saved and the war brought to an early conclusion, we will all be veyy, very thank ful.”

From the Democratic side of the aisle, Senator, Lee Metcalf of Montana, said: “President Nixon has definitely made it his war. The risks are consid erable. I hope and pray he can end the war this way. I have grave doubts about it.”

Senator Edmund S. Muskie, Democrat of Maine, questioned how it had been possible that “things could be so good 10 days ago when the President announced plans to withdraw 150,000 troops over the next year, and “so bad tonight.”
