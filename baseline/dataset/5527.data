Straining to say something significant about Vietnam and moral values, ''Intimate Strangers'' ends up close to incoherent babble. The television movie on CBS at 9 tonight stars Stacy Keach and Teri Garr as one of the more hapless couples likely to be encountered in this new year.

The story, written by Norman MacLeod Morrill, begins in Saigon in the 1970's as the American troops are being pulled out. Dr. Jeffrey Bierston (Mr. Keach) and his wife, Sally (Miss Garr), a nurse, have just finished a life-saving operation, and they arrange to meet later with their bags to join the evacuation. She never makes it. Cut to 10 years later. Jeff is a successful general practitioner - ''I treat tennis elbow, crabs and sunburn, that's the kind of doctor I am'' - in Jacksonville, Fla., sporting a splendid sailboat and a female friend (Cathy Lee Crosby). Just when he has about given up trying to find Sally, she appears among a group of Vietnamese boat-people. She is accompanied by a young Asian boy named George (Max Barabas), who seems to speak perfect English.

It seems that Sally has spent most of the previous decade in a Vietnamese prison camp, and she is understandably a bit tense about resuming her marriage. For one thing, she is not happy to find that Jeff has ignored his potential as a master surgeon. For another, she keeps having recurring nightmares about her camp experiences. And her relationship to George seems to be a bit more complicated than she is saying (the final revelation of truth is somehat less than surprising).

Jeff, however, is unfailingly understanding, even as he finds Sally locking herself in a closet with a hunting knife. His attractive friend pops up periodically to make such grand announcements as ''this is the first time I've ever wanted to fight for someone I love.'' And an old war buddy, now a psychiatrist, agrees to look into Sally's problem although, as played by Max Gail, this character has little to do except look affably thoughtful. Meanwhile, Sally becomes involved with a Hispanic woman (Priscilla Lopez) who is running a failing clinic for the poor where, at one of the story's frequent points of unbelievability, a stabbing victim is rushed in for an emergency operation.
