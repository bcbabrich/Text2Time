Spring arrived officially in the world of ballet on Saturday night at the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College, where the Ballet Concierto de Puerto Rico spread its usual warmth and the joy of its vital classicism. The program covered many themes and styles. But the three New York premieres had in common a refreshing directness and imagination.

"Jayanes (Strong, Supple Men)," a dance for four men that was choreographed by Alberto Mendez to music by Hindemith, would look just right in an Olympics performance. Rooted to the center of the stage, the men move mostly over and around one another, using bodies as balances and levers, creating a human tangle of a jungle gym. They're athletes, but "Jayanes" is as much an ode to the dignity of the human body as it is a celebration of youth, strength and virility. The quartet was performed by Edwin Silfa, Carlos Raul Sierra, Armando Seda and Roberto Lopez.

"The House of Bernarda Alba," the Garcia Lorca play about the repressed lives of a Spanish mother and her daughters, has inspired too many dances. But the choreographer Julio Lopez manages to say something fresh about that brood of fateful hens in "La Casa de Bernarda Alba," set to an appropriately obsessive score by Frank Martin. Mr. Lopez is helped by Carlos Gazzaniga's stark backdrop of a towering hallway, chair and door, though the door looks uncharacteristically unornamented for a Spanish household. The performers were first-rate. And Mr. Lopez tells his story crisply, through expressive bodies assuming stylized shapes, and through a few shocking images.

A small bridal veil is used to touching effect, first as it is contemplated longingly, then put on, by Angustias, the eldest daughter of the household, just as her sister Adela seduces and runs off with Angustias's fiance. The absence of that subsequently discarded veil, which Adela looks for with wide-eyed pain on her return, suggests how very strong the prison bars of this household are, even for those who escape. Adela's dream of escape is communicated poignantly in a high lift in which she seems to surge upward out of her lover's arms and into open air. The introduction of Garcia Lorca as a Christ figure is a little confusing. But a duet for the mother, Bernarda Alba, and the alter ego who scorns her, is a revealing addition.
