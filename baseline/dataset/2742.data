''Current management had an opportunity to restate this transaction along with the $190 million,'' Mr. Rohan said, ''so it would beg the question of why they thought this was so different.''

Supporters of Mr. Parsons note that he never promised a quick or easy end to the accounting investigations. In meetings with employees and in public statements, Mr. Parsons has discussed the course of the investigation as a significant uncertainty hanging over the company's future, people who worked with him said.

The company has said that its auditors, Ernst & Young, approved the accounting for the Bertelsmann deal, and some lawyers noted that AOL Time Warner may dissuade the S.E.C. from requiring another restatement.

''The fact that the S.E.C. has engaged in dialogue with the company with respect to this issue does not indicate a decision one way or another,'' said Lewis D. Lowenfels, an expert in securities law at Tolins & Lowenfels in New York.

One reason AOL Time Warner's management did not suspect the deal, however, is that S.E.C. policy is still evolving in addressing abuses of the Internet boom, a time when many online companies artificially inflated their results by exchanging goods and services at overstated values. So far, the S.E.C. has mainly cracked down on circular arrangements that two companies used to swap payments through a third party, hiding the reciprocity to deceive investors. AOL Time Warner's previous restatements corrected several undisclosed three-way transactions initiated by the AOL division and only occasionally involving others, people involved in the internal inquiry have said.

But AOL Time Warner and Bertelsmann appeared to disclose both sides of their transaction to investors, and the S.E.C. is still raising enough doubts about its propriety to warrant disclosure in the company's filings. The S.E.C. is evidently questioning whether the advertising sold to Bertelsmann was really a true sale worth $400 million.

The wide approach raises issues about the market value of online advertising and leads to similar inquiries into smaller reciprocal deals AOL made. For years, Robert W. Pittman, former president of America Online and chief operating officer of AOL Time Warner, said with pride that AOL seldom opened its checkbook for a telecommunications company or other business partner without selling it some online advertising as well. Many deals, including the Bertelsmann transaction, involved at least some sales of advertising in other parts of the company, like its Turner Broadcasting networks or Time Inc. magazines.
