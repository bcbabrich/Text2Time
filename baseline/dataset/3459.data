Teodoro Garcia, a reluctant Mexican lieutenant who battled the rebel Pancho Villa in the Mexican Revolution and is believed to be the last soldier in the army of the dictator Porfirio Diaz, died last Saturday in a retirement home in Texas City, Tex. He was 110.

''He was the last Federal,'' said Manuel Urbina 2d, a professor of Latin American history at the College of the Mainland in Texas City, and an expert on the survivors of the Mexican Revolution. ''There are a few, very few, who fought with Villa and others, and who are still alive because they were 11-, 12-, 13-year-old boys, or they fought with later factional governments during the revolution. But Garcia was the last who fought with Diaz.''

Mr. Garcia was born into a family of prosperous landowners on Jan. 7, 1889, in Sacramento, in the Mexican state of Coahuila, about 100 miles southwest of Laredo, Tex. Although he sympathized with the poor, he made an offhand promise to a friend that he would join the Federales, a name for Diaz's army, if they ever passed through town. When they did, a few weeks later, the young Garcia felt that as a matter of honor, he had to enlist.

Joining the Federales -- the name now refers to the Mexican federal police -- was also somewhat expected of Mr. Garcia. His family, after all, had about 40 peones on its hacienda, and President Diaz was battling civil insurrection. As it turned out, Mr. Garcia fought on the losing side. Diaz, in power since 1876, was overthrown in 1911 by Francisco Madero, with the help of Villa, the revolutionary leader in the north of Mexico, and Emiliano Zapata, the leader in the south.
