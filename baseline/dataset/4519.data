Agassi clawed his way back into contention after he suddenly began connecting with his bludgeonlike forehands, and he took full command in the fourth set's tie breaker. But when he dropped his serve after he lept, twirled and dropped a fancy backhand volley into the net at break point in the sixth game of the final set, he never recovered. Game Plan Rendered Worthless

Once Enqvist held for 5-2, Agassi wilted under the pressure on his own serve: a wild backhand sent the duel to match point, and Enqvist converted it with an uncatchable forehand.

"We had a game plan, but if you're not sharp, it doesn't matter," said Agassi, who felt let down by his backhand and undermined by Enqvist's strong service games, which produced 20 aces and enabled him to save all but five of the 16 break points Agassi held.

Agassi, whose next assignment is protecting the United States Davis Cup team from expulsion from elite competition in 1994, said he wasn't yet sure how to regroup. He's trying to adopt Segura's more thoughtful approach to competition, but is now uncertain about sabotaging his reflexes with rumination.

"It's a Catch-22, a big debate in my mind," Agassi said. "How much do I just rely on instincts and how much do I have a clue as to what I'm doing? Either way, I should win a match like this."

Enqvist, in contrast to Agassi, has been a late bloomer. In 1991, while Agassi was battling in a final at the French Open, so too was Enqvist, who wound up the runner-up in the junior boy's competition. Enqvist was the top junior in the world that year, which also happened to be the year the 15-year-old Capriati reached the semifinals of both the French and United States Opens. Acceptance of Blame

This year Capriati had gained the quarterfinal rounds at the Australian, French and Wimbledon only to lose to Steffi Graf on each occasion. Like Agassi, she had high hopes here.
