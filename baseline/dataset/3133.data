The baby alligator sighted in Harlem Meer in Central Park was actually a baby spectacled caiman. But its appearance recalled that most enduring urban legend, the alligators who roam the city's sewers.

These alligators are said to trace their origins to an ur-alligator who was flushed down a toilet and found a convenient breeding place in the sewers. This ur-alligator's offspring have proved endlessly fascinating to creative artists.

Radiohead's new song ''Alligators in the Sewers'' (not on its new CD but posted on the Internet) includes the lament:

Baby alligators in the sewers grow up fast,

Grow up fast,

Anything you want it can be done,

How did you go bad?

A giant alligator prowled the sewers in John Sayles's 1980 film ''Alligator,'' one of the decade's memorable horror films. Unsurprisingly, 16 years later the movie gave birth to ''Alligator II -- The Mutation.''
