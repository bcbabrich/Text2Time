As far as maiden voyages go, the first live stream of a Broadway musical was mostly smooth sailing. Save for a few technical hiccups that were resolved by the end of the opening number, BroadwayHD’s stream of this enchanting revival of “She Loves Me” did everything right.

But theater broadcasts — or streams, or both — are not without their challenges. Contractual complexities aside, television and live stage productions go together like peanut butter and wine. You can, but that doesn’t make it a great idea.

In “She Loves Me,” which opened in March at Studio 54, Laura Benanti and Zachary Levi star as perfume store clerks falling in love through letters, all while loathing each other at work. (It’s based on a play by Miklos Laszlo, which also inspired the 1940 film “The Shop Around the Corner” and, later, “You’ve Got Mail.”)

BroadwayHD.com streamed the performance on Thursday at 8 p.m., live to anyone willing to pay $10. It was the first broadcast of its kind; while some opera and ballet performances live-stream in movie theaters, this event was for home viewers, online through Apple TV and Roku. And while it presented financial, artistic and technological complications, it also presented an opportunity to reach (and monetize) audiences who would otherwise not have access to Broadway productions.
