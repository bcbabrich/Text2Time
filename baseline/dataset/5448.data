Sean Kelly, Stephen Roche and Laurent Fignon, three of the favorites in the Tour de France bicycle race, agree that at the start in West Berlin Wednesday there will really be no favorite.

''By far, this Tour is one of the most wide open in history,'' Fignon said.

''The race is going to be very open, with seven or eight favorites,'' Kelly agreed.

''At least 15 riders have to be thinking they can win it,'' Roche said.

They all pointed to the absence of Greg LeMond, last year's winner, and Bernard Hinault, who was second last year after five victories in the Tour. LeMond is out because of gunshot wounds suffered in a hunting accident and Hinault has retired.

''Before, you just had to keep your eye on Hinault and LeMond,'' Roche said. ''Now we're going to have to watch everybody.'' 'A Lot of Action'
