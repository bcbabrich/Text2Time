As a vegetarian, I was deeply disturbed and offended by Priscilla Feral's remarks about animal issues in general and Friends of Animals policy in particular [ ''Connecticut Q&A,'' Oct. 11 ] .

On the one hand, she claimed to be a vegetarian. But then she admitted that she eats ''a little fish.'' I don't know how little a fish has to be before it stops being an animal. But it sure isn't a vegetable, no matter how small it gets.

Ms. Feral went on to say that she'd become a full-fledged vegetarian if only she were single ''and free to be that selfish.''

What in the world is she talking about? If vegetarianism, especially the ethical kind, is anything, it's unselfish. That's the whole point of it. A person chooses not to eat meat for the sake of animals, not because of his or her own appetite.
