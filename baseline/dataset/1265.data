A 25-year-old David Beckham might be a perfect fit for a team like free-wheeling, goal-scoring, title-contending Tottenham. But could a 35-year-old Beckham be a good addition for Spurs, too?

Tottenham Manager Harry Redknapp seems to think so. And he might be right, as long as Beckham is willing to accept a reserve role – which seems to be the case – in exchange for some White Hart Love and a potential revival of his never-ending England career. In Redknapp’s view, Beckham’s big-game experience and his value as a steadying hand could be a nice thing to pluck off the bench late in games for a young team trying to push its way to the upper reaches of the Premier League and the Champions League.

Remember, Beckham’s aging body and long-lost speed won’t be an issue when he’s lashing a free kick or slicing a corner toward the back post in a tie game.

Acknowledging that Spurs have contacted Beckham’s perpetually slighted employer, the Los Angeles Galaxy, about a possible winter loan, Redknapp said: “He can still do a job, otherwise I wouldn’t bother. I’m not in a position where I need to go get somebody to sell tickets. The ground’s full every week. If he came, he could make a big impact.”

The Galaxy said two weeks ago that Beckham wouldn’t be going on loan anywhere this winter, but like a Brett Favre retirement pledge, we’ll see how that promise holds up. In the Beckham-Galaxy relationship, which has endured two earlier loans to A.C. Milan and a high-profile spat between Beckham and his Galaxy co-star Landon Donovan, fidelity is often fleeting.

Redknapp is wisely playing down expectations.

“David said that he would like to come here and play here at Tottenham,” he said. “I don’t think he expects to play every game for us, and he’s not going to – he’s got to get in the team, obviously – but I still think he could play a big part for us.”

Put The Guardian’s Jacob Steinberg in the skeptical column. On Thursday he wrote:

In gripping etymological news today, the word “exclusive” appears to have altered its meaning with the Mirror and the Daily Express both EXCLUSIVELY reporting that Tottenham are the favourites to sign David Beckham on a loan deal from LA Galaxy which will last for two dispiriting and vaguely unsatisfying months. There aren’t any quotes or anything fancy like that, so the fact that Beckham’s grandad, Joe West, supported Spurs appears to form the basis for this particular piece of tittle-tattle. Blackburn, Everton, Newcastle, Sunderland and West Ham are also said to be keen on upping their shirt sales.

But getting to the heart of the matter, the Telegraph’s Jason Burt, pointing out that Beckham grew up near Tottenham’s training facility, wrote that there really is no downside for Spurs. It’s not as if they’d be buying Beckham outright, or agreeing to cover anything like the five-year, $250 million deal he has with the Galaxy.

If it does not work then the worst that could happen is Beckham will merely occupy the bench. That could provide an unnecessary distraction but Redknapp is no fool and will handle the situation well — as he had done in the past with other older players. He knows that Beckham, as he has proved with England under Fabio Capello, will understand the situation and comply as a squad player and a strong influence. He will not be disruptive. Significantly, also, he has won the trophies Spurs dream of.

Before any of that happens, there will be some questions to answer:

–Would Redknapp be foolish to slow down a team running like a finely tuned McLaren to pick up Beckham on the side of the road?

–Would the Galaxy’s fans ever forgive them if they allowed Beckham to leave on yet another off-season loan?

–What if Spurs advances to the quarterfinals of the Champions League just as the loan is winding down? What would Beckham do then? What would the Galaxy do?

Extra time: If Beckham really wants to date other clubs every winter, shouldn’t he just divorce the Galaxy once and for all?
