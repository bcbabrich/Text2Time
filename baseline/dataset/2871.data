It is a magical sight: most mornings at dawn, two hot-air balloons bearing tourists rise up and float silently above this ancient city of Buddhist temples and pagodas. After dodging and weaving for an hour through soft breezes, they set down on a parched riverbed.

Children from a nearby village gather to gape as the British pilots deflate the balloons and pop bottles of Champagne for the passengers. Rough travel, this is not.

It is precisely the kind of tourism deplored by democracy advocates inside and outside Myanmar. They say that travelers should not visit this country, once called Burma, because tourism dollars help underwrite its repressive military government. If people insist on going, the critics say, they should at least avoid plush hotels and sightseeing activities.

Sipping Champagne after a recent flight, some passengers explained their decision to make the trip.

''I worried about political correctness prior to visiting Myanmar, but now I feel it is politically incorrect not to visit,'' said Helen Hasenfeld, an administrator at the California Institute of Technology.
