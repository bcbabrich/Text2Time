There’s a line early on in “21 & Over” about your “oldest friends always being your strangest ones.” That may be true, but there is a bigger theme here: After four years of college lifelong friendships can become forced, resulting in awkward attempts to reconnect and relive the good old days.

Not that the second point is explored with much depth in this movie, about an odd couple — the motor-mouthed, self-involved Miller (Miles Teller, channeling a 1980s John Cusack) and the Wall Street-bound, straight arrow Casey (the charming Skylar Astin) — who surprise their old pal, Jeff Chang (Justin Chon), with a visit on his 21st birthday. Debauchery is expected for such a milestone, but these guys get into more trouble in one night than members of this film’s target audience will encounter in their entire college lives.
