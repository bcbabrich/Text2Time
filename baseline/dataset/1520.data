To capture a glimpse of the future of American soccer, the French photographer Charles Fréger shot players who, like many in the American talent pool these days, were born abroad or whose parents were. To make his portraits, he had to visit the Netherlands — where a group of under-20s was gathered for a tournament — as well as Salt Lake City, Dallas and Norway. It’s an itinerary that hints at another truth about American soccer talent: it’s not only coming from abroad; at ever younger ages, it’s also going abroad.
