Dear Diary:

Recent news coverage regarding a documentary about the film director Brian De Palma reminded me of the day in 1970 when he and Robert De Niro came to our I.M. Pei faculty/grad student building at New York University on Bleecker Street (now called Silver Towers).

The film, called “Hi, Mom,” continued the story of the antihero in “Greetings,” who was now a peeping Tom. My apartment was the object of his obsession, since it was opposite their other site on Greene Street.

Mr. De Niro was handsome and polite and smiled at our 6-month-old. Mr. De Palma shrugged around our place checking camera angles. I think we got $100 and moved out for 24 hours.

When we came back, they were still working on a scene with the actress Jennifer Salt, who was in a flimsy robe and getting ready to reshoot a nude scene in our bathtub. She was apologizing/explaining to my young wife about how acting and real life were not necessarily the same.
