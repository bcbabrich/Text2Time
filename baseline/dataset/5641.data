John McEnroe was upset by both his opponent and the officiating today, winding up with a defeat, a fine and a suspension.

Sergio Casal of Spain, a qualifier, achieved a 6-3, 7-6 victory over the fifth-seeded McEnroe in the quarterfinals of the $625,000 Paris Open tennis tournament.

''You are the worst umpire I've seen in my life,'' the American player yelled at the chair umpire, Jeremy Shales of Britain, as he packed his bag and stormed off the court after the match. ''You'll never work another one of my matches again.''

Within hours of the outburst, McEnroe was fined $3,000, forcing a 42-day suspension from tournament play because he exceeded his limit for the year. If McEnroe does not appeal, the suspension will take effect Nov. 10.
