The couple have known each other for 23 years. Their sexual orientation became public when the church they belonged to learned of their relationship and refused to recommend Ms. O'Donovan for a scholarship to Hartford Seminary. That "threw us out of the closet," she said. "We decided to turn that liability into an asset and to be fully open."

She completed her studies at Hartford Seminary and graduated in the spring of 1988 from Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge, Mass. As far as she knows, Ms. O'Donovan said, she is still the only openly gay woman to be ordained in the state. The United Church of Christ, formed in 1961 by the merger of the Evangelical and Reformed Church with Congregational Christian Churches, is the only mainstream Protestant denomination that ordains openly gay and lesbian clergy. Some Positive Changes

Although gays and lesbians are still not accepted in much of mainstream religious life, some positive changes have taken place in the five years since her ordination, Ms. O'Donovan said. "I don't feel so lonely because I may be the only one who has gone through the ordination process. There are more lesbian and gay clergy out there and we're there for each other in some important ways."

Some churches in Connecticut are taking steps toward welcoming openly homosexual members through what is called the Open and Affirming process, by which some United Church of Christ congregations becomes sensitive to gay and lesbian issues. Seven of 273 United Church of Christ congregations in Connecticut have Open and Affirming status, Ms. O'Donovan said, and about 12 more are addressing the issue in sermons, workshops and discussions.

Ms. O'Donovan draws support from lay and ordained members of the United Church Coalition for Lesbian-Gay Concerns, an organization established 10 years ago in the state to insure that lesbian, gay and bisexual Christians are able to participate fully in their churches. She tries to raise awareness of homophobia and other lay and lesbian issues through the articles she writes and the workshops she leads. 'Justice Preacher'

But her sermons express equality for all. Calling herself a "justice preacher," Ms. O'Donovan reaches beyond gay and lesbian issues and exhorts her congregation to reach out to all who are different because of economic situation, skin color, accent, sex or age.

Susan Thomas is a member of the board of deacons, who are responsible for the spiritual life and worship of the church. "I didn't know anyone who was homosexual before," she said. "It has really broadened my horizons and helped me to become more aware of their issues, of how they are discriminated against and victimized. I learned more about her struggles and it made me a lot more sensitive."
