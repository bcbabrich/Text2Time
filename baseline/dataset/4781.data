Lewis Carroll's passion for word games has kept many a scholar busy, and amused, prowling editions of his work looking for verbal intricacies to decipher.

The latest discovery -- a multimedia, four-way pun in "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" that has eluded scholars since the children's classic was published 127 years ago -- was made by an unusual pair of scholars: two teen-agers from New Jersey.

The pun is both a visual and verbal toying with the word "tail," in the poem from Chapter Two, "A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale." The "tale" of the chapter's title is told to Alice by a mouse, in a poem that is presented in the shape of a long tail, curving down and across the page.

But the two students found that neither tale, nor tail, ended there.

When the poem was straightened out and set in traditional stanza form, they saw that each stanza takes the form of a mouse, with two short lines forming the body and a the third, longer line forming the tail.
