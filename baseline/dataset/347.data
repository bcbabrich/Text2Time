An article on Friday about reaction to President Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord attributed a quotation incorrectly. It was Lavanya Rajamani, a professor at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi — not her colleague Navroz K. Dubash — who said, “Stating that the Paris Agreement hamstrings the U.S. while allowing India and China to increase their emissions is baffling. The Agreement allows every country to choose its pledge tailored to its national circumstances.” The article also referred incorrectly to comments by President Emmanuel Macron of France. In criticizing Mr. Trump’s decision, Mr. Macron spoke in French before switching to English, not the other way around.

NEW YORK

An article last Saturday about parking permits in New York City misstated the number of placards given to city employees, as well as the total number of people employed by the city and the percentage of total placards held by city workers. About 114,600 of the placards were given to city employees, not 160,500. As of March, there were 317,944 full-time city employees, not 293,296, meaning that less than a third of all city employees have parking permits, not more than half.

SPORTS

A headline on Thursday with an article about the Yankees’ Aaron Judge referred incorrectly to his position in voting for the All-Star Game. As the article correctly noted, he is third overall, not third in the American League.

An article in some copies on Sunday about the Mets’ 5-4 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates misidentified the Pittsburgh player who advanced to third base on an Addison Reed wild pitch and scored the tying run in the ninth inning. The player was the pinch-runner Gift Ngoepe — not Jordy Mercer, for whom Ngoepe entered the game.
