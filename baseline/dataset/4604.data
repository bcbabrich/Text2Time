Jubilant members of the Coalition for a Better Waterfront, a citizens group that had proposed an alternative plan, said tonight that the results meant that it was time for the city to listen to the citizens.

"What a great day," said Ron Hine, a leader of the coalition. "The people have spoken twice now and the message is clear." But, he added, "We really want to extend an olive branch now and work for an alternative like the one we proposed."

Under the plan that was defeated today, the city would have leased four parcels of waterfront property, including a 5.5-acre pier next to the PATH transportation terminal, to the Port Authority for 55 years. The authority would have prepared the site and sought a developer to build a 20-story office tower and 9-story hotel on the pier, as well as two residential buildings just west of it.

The opponents offered a plan covering the entire length of the waterfront. They called for a mile-long walkway, 19 blocks of mixed residential and commercial development and more than 20 acres of new parks. Residents Bitterly Divided

The city's plan had bitterly divided residents of this old Hudson River port city, which has a population of 33,400. Business and civic groups endorsed the plan as a means for new jobs and new revenues to stabilize high property taxes. Opponents said it would give too much of the city's valuable waterfront to the Port Authority, break environmental laws and overwhelm the three- and four-story buildings that give Hoboken a small-town character.
