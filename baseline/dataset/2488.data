Johnson & Johnson's proposed acquisition of the Guidant Corporation is expected to be approved by the Federal Trade Commission as early as today, executives involved in the deal said yesterday.

Approval of the transaction may force the companies to end a standoff over renegotiating the price of the $25.4 billion deal.

Johnson & Johnson is pushing to lower the price, contending that Guidant's business has been seriously damaged since it recalled tens of thousands of implantable heart devices like defibrillators and pacemakers. The Food and Drug Administration is investigating Guidant's handling of product-related safety issues.

Under the terms of the transaction, Johnson & Johnson would have 48 hours from the time the agency approves the deal to complete it. If Johnson & Johnson lets that period lapse or decides to walk away from the deal citing a "material adverse change" in Guidant's business, Guidant could then decide to sue.
