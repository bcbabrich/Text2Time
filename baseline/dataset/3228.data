Elliot L. Richardson, the archetype of the cultivated New England Brahmin who served in an astonishingly broad range of high public positions, and who was best known for his refusal during Watergate to obey President Richard M. Nixon's order to fire a special prosecutor, died yesterday in his native Massachusetts. He was 79.

Mr. Richardson died at the Massachusetts General Hospital from complications after a cerebral hemorrhage, his son Michael reported.

Mr. Richardson, who was descended from some of Boston's earliest settlers, was sometimes referred to by friends as ''the former everything'' because of the great variety of positions he held both in Massachusetts and in the federal government. He served as attorney general and United States attorney in Massachusetts, was second-in-command at the State Department and held four cabinet positions, more than anyone else in history. He also served as ambassador to Britain, negotiated the worldwide treaty on the Law of the Sea and was the chief representative of the United Nations in monitoring Nicaraguan elections in 1990, among other assignments.

But it was Mr. Richardson's stand during Watergate when he was Richard M. Nixon's attorney general that was widely lauded as a special moment of integrity and rectitude that secured him a place in the nation's history. President Nixon ordered Mr. Richardson to fire Archibald M. Cox, the special Watergate prosecutor, but Mr. Richardson chose to resign instead.
