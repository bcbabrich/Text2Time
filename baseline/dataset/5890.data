The United Technologies Corporation said yesterday that the diversity of its product line helped net income in the fourth quarter of last year to rise 15.7 percent, to $112.8 million, or $1.78 a share, from $97.5 million, or $1.51 a share, in the fourth quarter of 1981. Revenues edged up to $3.54 billion, from $3.51 billion.

For the full year, the big Hartford-based technology and aerospace concern increased earnings 16.6 percent, to $533.7 million, or $8.74 a share, from $457.7 million, or $7.71 a share, in 1981. Revenues eased to $13.58 billion, from $13.67 billion.

Results for the year included the cumulative effect of a previously announced accounting change for investment tax credits of $66.6 million in the first quarter and a $40.2 million tax-free extraordinary gain resulting from an exchange in the second quarter of common stock and cash for United Technologies' debentures.

Excluding the accounting change and extraordinary gain, net income in 1982 fell 6.7 percent, to $426.9 million, from $457.7 million. Harry J. Gray, chairman, president and chief executive, said the company had ''held its own in 1982 in the face of the roughest economy in decades'' while its diversity of business and strong market positions softened the impact of lower volume and substantially higher research and development investments.
