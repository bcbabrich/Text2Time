Carl Levine, a former top home furnishings executive at Bloomingdale's whose exclusive imports and elegant model rooms played a large part in building the retailer's image as the hippest store in Manhattan in the 1960's and 70's, died on Friday in his Fifth Avenue apartment. He was 75.

The cause was cancer, his family said.

It was Mr. Levine who showed Queen Elizabeth around the model rooms he created for Bloomingdale's during the Bicentennial celebrations in 1976, evidence that the store was a must-stop even for royal tourists.

The queen's visit was notable in several respects: it was the first visit to the store by a reigning monarch, and was probably the first (and possibly the last time) that part of Lexington Avenue, which is one-way downtown, was switched briefly to run uptown, to accommodate the queen, who leaves her limousine only from the right side.

Mr. Levine was born, coincidentally, in Bloomingdale, N.J., and was a member of the third generation of his family in the home furnishings business. He joined Bloomingdale's in 1955 as a trainee and graduated to assistant mattress buyer. In 1979, he was promoted to senior vice president.
