The past few years of fashion documentaries have rolled out portraits of the talented and fabulous that largely embrace their subjects’ cult of personality and occasionally even talk about their clothes. “A Man’s Story,” an unsatisfying look at the London designer Ozwald Boateng, was shot over 12 years and aspires to a degree of intimacy, yet this glancing treatment is not very enlightening.

The director Varon Bonicos whirls through Mr. Boateng’s eventful life, from his annus horribilis in 1998-99, troubled by a painful romantic breakup and business catastrophes, through his rise to a Savile Row shop address and stewardship of Givenchy. Son of Ghanaian immigrants, Mr. Boateng worries about spending enough time with his wife, Gyunel, and their children but hardly ever has a stitch out of place. Mr. Bonicos issues bland updates in voice-over, though he also sees fit to confront Gyunel about a suspected affair. (They later divorced.)

Mr. Boateng’s stress levels do not make riveting material, and his resilience is not joined by illuminating commentary. His suits, praised by the likes of Laurence Fishburne and Will Smith, are quite the opposite, resplendent in snappy colors and smart fits. But Mr. Bonicos trots out musical montages to cover the fashion shows that so occupy Mr. Boateng (now 45) and skips over the nuances and evolution of his style, influence or reception.

Mr. Vonicos, who also contributed to the 2006 TV series “House of Boateng,” misses an opportunity to make a feature-length documentary that takes the full measure of his subject’s work.
