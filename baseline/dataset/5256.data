After years of battling for equal recognition, graduates of foreign medical schools may soon be able to take the same test in basic and clinical sciences that is given to graduates of American medical schools.

The National Board of Medical Examiners developed and administers the tests to students of medical schools in the United States to certify them before licensing by the states. It decided last month to consider offering the major parts of its examination to graduates of foreign medical schools.

Dr. Robert Volle, president of the board, said that with the change, about 20,000 more people would take the national board's examination each year.

The graduates of foreign medical schools, many of them Americans, now take a separate examination, administered by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates, the foreign graduates' equivalent of the national board. The educational commission supported the national board's decision when it met later last month. Both organizations are in Philadlephia. Joint Panel to Make Decision The national board had said the separate tests were needed because the board did not have enough information on the curriculums of medical schools in foreign countries. The two groups will form a joint committee to decide whether to abolish the separate examination for foreign graduates and to arrange to give the national board exam on the same days to the 20,000 more candidates around the world. The change could come as early as next year, Dr. Volle said.
