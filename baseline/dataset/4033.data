I want balance. I want fairness and I'm not finding it. That's a problem in many areas -- the judicial, legislative and executive branches. People have to force change and stop saying they can't make a difference. The so-called silent majority are people making less money, their quality of life is less. They're doing exactly what the Governor says they should do, working two, three and four jobs.

Q. Is the solution to create new jobs?

A. No! We should share in productivity.

Productivity is at an all-time high. What made this country great was when we went from a 12-hour day, 7 days a week, to reducing our work day and reducing our work week. We abolished child labor. We shared in productivity.

We believe in capital and that business has a right to profit. We also believe as workers that we are part of and deserve to share in that productivity. How do you do that? With higher wages or fewer hours.

What we're seeing is the stock market at an all-time high, corporate salaries at an all-time high and corporate profits at an all-time high but we see stagnation. In fact, we see a reduction in real purchasing power. We are 16th in wages in the world.

Q. Are immigrant workers taking American jobs?

A. Business is trying to turn us against each other. Those people are not our enemy. To think that my misery, my problems are because of the guy over here is wrong.

There's a certain amount of racism here. We are concerned about the Mexican border or about who's coming into Florida. When is the last time anyone complained about illegal Irish immigrants? Whether we be Irish, Polish, African-American or Hispanic, we are not each other's enemies. This is a country that can continue to accept people. Rather than working three or four jobs, maybe the new immigrant can have one of those jobs.

Q. And the jobs that are lost to foreign factories?

A. If we're going to be a superpower, a morally responsible player in the world scene, then we have to recognize that we cannot exploit other people and have a safe and good world for ourselves and our sons and daughters.
