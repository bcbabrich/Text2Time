Poring over material that The New York Times has published about Michael Jackson, we were particularly struck by the review of Mr. Jackson’s album “Thriller,” written by the critic John Rockwell and published in The Times on Dec. 19, 1982. (You can see a .pdf version of the review here.) It’s either eerily prescient, or proof that we can find hidden connections wherever we seek them.

In his opening paragraph, Mr. Rockwell looks at Mr. Jackson, then 24 and nowhere near the peak of his fame, fortune or influence, and sees a young man who, he later writes, has been “locked inside a celebrity’s cage since childhood.”

Mr. Rockwell begins: “Since he caught the public’s fancy as a bouncing, spinning, piping, 11-year-old mini-superstar in 1970, Michael Jackson has been a fullfledged celebrity, living a celebrity’s life. That’s worth remembering, because it means that today, one must guard against the assumption that he is a mature, fully formed artist and human being.”

As an artist, Mr. Rockwell adds, Mr. Jackson is a “practiced — sometimes too practiced — performer, recording star and film actor. But he remains a young man and with luck he will continue to mature.”

Mr. Rockwell declares “Thriller” itself to be a “wonderful pop record” and “as hopeful a sign as we have had yet that the destructive barriers that spring up regularly between white and black music — and in between whites and blacks — in this culture may be breached once again.”

But the critic is ultimately drawn back to Mr. Jackson’s inner life, beneath the sensitive soul who reveals himself on gentle pop songs like “Human Nature.” Mr. Jackson, he writes, “seems, on the basis of his interviews, to have a genuinely childlike and emotionally open attitude toward life. Sometimes his fame seems to insulate him, but it also elevates him to fantasy status for his fans.”

In an optimistic coda, Mr. Rockwell concludes that “’Thriller’ suggests that Mr. Jackson’s evolution as an artist is far from finished. He is, after all, only 24 years old.”
