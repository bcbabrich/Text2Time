Josh Beckett was the last Red Sox player to reach the field before Game 1 of the division series against the Angels. Beckett was one of the first players to leave the field before the pregame drills were over. As Beckett entered and exited, he did not speak to reporters about his strained oblique muscle.

Beckett, who is one of the best postseason pitchers of his generation, was supposed to start the opener. But Beckett strained his oblique during a throwing session last Friday and is tentatively scheduled to pitch Game 3 on Sunday.

While Manager Terry Francona has been optimistic about Beckett’s situation, the Red Sox are still uncertain he will be able to pitch. Beckett has a bullpen session scheduled for Thursday’s off day. If Beckett throws without difficulties and does not have any trouble Friday, he could start Sunday.

Francona would not call Beckett “a lock” to start because he did not think that word was appropriate. After Beckett long tossed from 150 feet Wednesday, Francona said the bigger test will come Thursday.

“Now, if everything goes O.K., he’ll throw his side tomorrow, but we reserve the right to make a change if we don’t think it’s in his best interest physically,” Francona said. “But he had a real good last couple of days, and today was another good day.”

If Beckett cannot pitch, Boston would start Paul Byrd or the knuckleballer Tim Wakefield. Beckett was 4-0 with a 1.20 earned run average as the Red Sox rumbled to the World Series title last season. Not having Beckett at all would obviously impair Boston’s chances to repeat as champions.
