For decades, lawyers have been talking about the desirability of a national bar examination, but progress in that direction has been painfully slow.

''The practice of law in America is interstate these days, but the bar exam is a hanging-on from days gone by, an old states' rights issue,'' said Norman Krivosha, former Chief Justice of the Nebraska Supreme Court, who has long argued for a national bar exam.

This year, for the first time, the mechanism for such an examination will be in place.

In most states, the bar examination is administered over two days, with multiple-choice questions asked on one day and essays written on the other. Since 1972 each state has had the option of replacing its multiple-choice test with 200 computer-graded questions. All butLouisiana, Washington, Indiana and Iowa are using the questions in the multistate test. Essay Questions Prepared

Now the National Conference of Bar Examiners is preparing a set of essay questions the states can use. Six states have already agreed to use those questions, and others are expected to follow suit.
