Poor Lea Michele. It’s one thing to play the ingénue to Kristin Chenoweth’s dipsomaniac belter, which is what she had to do Wednesday night on the fifth episode of “Glee.” It’s quite another to have the show cut back and forth between you and her as you both sing “Maybe This Time” from “Cabaret.” Ms. Michele is a fine singer, but really. We’re talking about Kristin Chenoweth. It felt like there should have been a mercy rule, so they could call it off before anyone had to sing “Everybody … loves a winner …”

The producers worked Ms. Chenoweth into the show by concocting a plot in which Will (Matthew Morrison) discovers that his high school crush and vocal role model, April Rhodes, never graduated and therefore can re-enroll and join the glee club. He needs her to take the place of Rachel (Ms. Michele), who has defected to the school musical (“Cabaret”). It’s now time to wonder when the show will stop making Will behave in ways completely at odds with Mr. Morrison’s bland, gentle performance. (Or, conversely, when Mr. Morrison will start playing him the way he’s written.)

The writers had a tricky balancing act to pull off: Ms. Chenoweth was the star of the episode, and April’s hijinks were the comic focus, but at the same time the plot had to be engineered so that Rachel would leave the musical and triumphantly return by the end of the hour. This meant shoving April out the door under cover of a lesson: that it’s the kids’ turn in the spotlight, as long as we’ve established that Kristin Chenoweth can sing them all off the stage.

Ms. Chenoweth made it all work, even the lesson, with her singular brand of daffy intensity. And some of the bits were really funny, like the shoplifting lesson she gave two of the glee club girls, during which what appeared to be two-pound packages of ground round fell out of their skirts. Meanwhile, in the other, not so interesting story lines, Rachel battles Mr. Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky, who makes “My Vespa had a flat” the funniest line of the episode) for the right to play Sally Bowles; Finn (Cory Monteith) talks Rachel into coming back to glee because he thinks it will help him win a music scholarship; and Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) is still pretending to be pregnant. Jane Lynch’s Sue Sylvester only got one short scene.

The really good news: it was the best episode musically since the pilot. In addition to “Maybe This Time” we got Ms. Chenoweth and Mr. Morrison’s karaoke version of Heart’s “How Do I Get You Alone,” Ms. Chenoweth leading the glee club in Carrie Underwood’s “Last Name” (an odd choice for a high school ensemble, but whatever) and a truly rousing rendition of Queen’s “Somebody to Love” led by Ms. Michele.
