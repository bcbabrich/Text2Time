Airline officials said the plane's two pilots were based in Los Angeles and its three flight attendants in Seattle. Of the passengers, 33 were bound for San Francisco, 47 for Seattle, 3 for Eugene, Ore., and 1 for Fairbanks, Alaska.

The plane came down about 20 miles northwest of Los Angeles International Airport, the F.A.A. said, in water from 300 to more than 600 feet deep.

As night fell, local television stations offered live coverage of search helicopters hovering over scattered debris and a spreading fuel slick on the deep blue water about 12 miles offshore, where water temperatures were in the high 50's at the surface, and colder at greater depths, officials said.

As temperatures cooled and searchlights played across the 10- to 12-foot swells, the efforts drew more than 20 Coast Guard and Navy craft from as far away as San Diego.

Chief Petty Officer Randy Mitchell of the Coast Guard's station in Oxnard, Calif., the base of rescue operations, said this evening that searchers had discovered bodies, but would not say how many. He said helicopters equipped with heat-seeking infrared devices were being used trying to pick up any heat from survivors.

No divers were immediately used, apparently because depth exceeded their limits.

Early this evening, the Coast Guard ordered private craft, which had sailed into the area, to stay away from the debris field to avoid any confusion in search and rescue efforts.

James E. Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said in a telephone interview on ''Larry King Live'' on CNN that a so-called Go-Team, from the agency was scheduled to leave the East Coast Tuesday morning to begin its investigation of the crash, and was already considering whether to call for additional Coast Guard ships from Hawaii for possible salvage efforts.
