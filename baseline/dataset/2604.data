India's economy continued to be one of the fastest growing in the world, swelling 8.2 percent in the year ended in March, the country's most rapid pace of growth in a decade and a half.

''The economy grew a shade lower than our expectations, but still outperformed every economy other than China's,'' said Mahesh Vyas, chief executive of the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, an independent research group based in Mumbai.

In the most recent quarter, the economy slowed to a pace of 8.2 percent in a year-over-year comparison from the 10.5 percent rate posted in the previous quarter.

Mr. Vyas and other experts said they expected the rapid growth to continue this year, aided by the booming services and industrial sectors.
