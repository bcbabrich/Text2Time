Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner makes the rounds on the Sunday shows just a few days after Republicans resisted the proposal he presented to avert the so-called fiscal cliff. Mr. Geithner is scheduled to appear on ABC’s “This Week,” CBS’s “Face the Nation,” CNN’s “State of the Union,” “Fox News Sunday” and NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

Fox will also feature an interview with the House Republican speaker, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, who responded to the plan by saying Democrats were not being “serious” about cutting spending.

Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, will appear along with the chairs of both congressional intelligence committees — Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, and Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan — on CBS, discussing efforts to avert the fiscal crisis as well as the scrutiny that Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations, has received over the September attack in Libya.

Senator Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat, and Senator Kelly Ayotte, the New Hampshire Republican who joined Mr. Graham and Senator John McCain of Arizona in expressing opposition Tuesday to Ms. Rice’s potential nomination as secretary of state, will be on CNN.

On NBC, Senator Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican, and Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, will also weigh in on the looming fiscal troubles, calling for the parties to compromise.

Gene Sperling, the White House’s top economic adviser, appears on Bloomberg’s “Political Capital” and TV One’s “Washington Watch.” Also on TV One will be Representative James E. Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina.

C-Span’s “Newsmakers” features a conversation with Senator Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat.

Telemundo’s “Enfoque” and Univision’s “Al Punto” focus on Mexico’s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, and immigration reform in the United States. Representative Luis V. Gutiérrez, Democrat of Illinois, will be on Telemundo, talking about the bipartisan initiative in Congress to change the immigration system.
