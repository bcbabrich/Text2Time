A court-appointed special master rejected on Tuesday the N.F.L. players union’s claim that the league should not have access to $4 billion in television payments if there is a lockout. But he awarded the union $6.9 million in damages in connection with two particular contracts, with ESPN and NBC.

The union claimed in its filing against the N.F.L. that the league had negotiated lockout insurance with the networks that gave the teams unfair leverage over the players.

Few details of the decision were made available because the ruling by the special master, Stephen Burbank, was filed under seal. The hearing was not open to the news media.

The case is one of the many skirmishes in the labor battle between the league and the union as they face the expiration of their collective bargaining agreement on March 3.



In its statement, the league said “that if the union commits to invest as much time, energy and other resources in negotiation as it has in its litigation strategy, a new agreement could well be reached by March 4.”

It continued, “The special master squarely rejected the union’s demand that the N.F.L. be denied access to payments that the league’s television partners are obligated to make for the 2011 season.”

George Atallah, the union’s assistant executive director, said in a statement that Burbank found that the league had violated the 1993 antitrust agreement that established free agency “with respect to the N.F.L.’s negotiation of lockout insurance in its contracts with ESPN and NBC.”

He said the union would file an expedited appeal in federal court in Minnesota.

In a sarcastic posting on Twitter, Atallah wrote: “Now for the good news: The NFL, until the appeal in Minnesota, has $4 billion to not play football next year. Victory!”

The union was seeking a total of $60 million in damages, claiming the league gave the networks certain rights to the networks in 2009 and 2010 for nothing in return. The special master’s award of $6.9 million was the result of the timing of certain rights fee payments.

Greg Aiello, a spokesman for the N.F.L., discounted the amount of damages the league was told to pay. “The union spent twice as much on the case than it was awarded in damages,” he wrote in an e-mail, “which were a small fraction of TV revenue contracted for 2011. “
