All of their garlic is organic, as is the rocambole variety grown by Keith Stewart at Keith's Farm in Greenville, N.Y., in western Orange County. He sells all of it at the Union Square Greenmarket. ''It's frightening what they spray on garlic,'' Mrs. Nosonowitz said.

This is the peak of the garlic season. Growers in the Northeast have harvested their crop and have either just finished curing it, or will soon. They hang the garlic by its leaves for several weeks under controlled temperatures and humidity, with fans blowing to dry it. After the garlic is trimmed and cleaned, it is sorted according to size and variety, and placed in string bags, which are hung from the same rafters. From July to November, mature garlic is at its best.

If this local garlic is stored properly -- in a cool dry place in a string bag or garlic keeper -- it will last until February and be better than anything the supermarket has to offer, which is commercially grown garlic that has come from thousands of miles away. Almost 90 percent of the garlic sold in this country comes from California.

One of the biggest differences between local and California garlic is the basic variety: the former is hardneck, which sends up a central stalk and is more tolerant of colder climates; California's is softneck, which has a very small central stem.

Chester Aaron, who grows 87 kinds of garlic in Sonoma County, Calif., and is the author of ''The Great Garlic Book'' (Ten Speed Press, 1997), is partial to hardneck garlic. He said commercial farmers prefer the softneck because it is easier to grow, produces greater yields, is less labor intensive and lasts longer. But most softneck garlic has smaller cloves that are more difficult to peel and, many insist, tastes harsher. (It doesn't help that it is older when it gets here.)

Hardneck garlic, Mr. Aaron said, ''has a span of tastes that is far wider than softneck. Whenever I do a tasting I will put out both, and people's response is always that the hardneck is far superior.''

The differences were certainly clear when Mrs. Nosonowitz sat me down to taste her freshly minced products, offered on a spoon. She started me off with her favorite, Prussian White, also known as Music. It was pungent, with a pleasing aftertaste. Then, we moved on to Italian rocambole, somewhat gentler than the Prussian but still pungent.
