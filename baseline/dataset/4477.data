"But I feel I must do this," Mr. Stewart said. "A hunger strike is an appeal to people's conscience. Some have said to me, 'You must stop, Walter. People in science don't have consciences any more.' But I don't believe that. Unless I do something I certainly can't expect anyone else to. I don't feel I have a choice but to continue the fast." Call for Investigations

In addition to a hearing, Mr. Stewart has asked the health institutes to make a commitment to fair and thorough investigations of 15 cases of misconduct the pair were looking into. Among other things, he also seeks "an institutional reaffirmation of the principle that it is in the job of all scientists to address issues of questioned science."

The quality of Mr. Stewart's and Dr. Feder's work does not seem to be an issue. Their expertise has been used in a dozen cases at universities nationwide; government investigators have used their services; and more recently the American Historical Association has begun an investigation based on their charges about a historian's Lincoln biography. Their employee ratings have been excellent, said Earl Laurence, acting deputy director of the institute.

But they have angered many people in high places. When Dr. David Baltimore, the former president of Rockefeller University and co-author of a scientific paper that came under the pair's scrutiny, was asked by Science magazine about the action taken against the two, he replied: "I'm relieved. It's about time the Government realized it was paying for this kind of antischolarship activity and shut them down."

Not insignificantly, two of those they angered were Dr. Bernadine Healy, who is leaving as director of the health institutes, and Secretary Shalala. Dr. Feder and Mr. Stewart had angered Dr. Healy by helping Representative John Dingell's staff dig into a case of conflict of interest at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation when she was chief of research.

As for Dr. Shalala, Mr. Stewart and Dr. Feder criticized her before she joined the Cabinet because she had halted the investigation of a case of misconduct at the University of Wisconsin when she was chancellor there. An inquiry panel at the university and Mr. Stewart and Dr. Feder had concluded that the work of a university scientist contained faked data.

But when the Office of Scientific Integrity, since disbanded by Dr. Healy, tried to take up the case for an official investigation, Dr. Shalala refused to turn over the evidence to the Government. At the time, the investigators were forced to close the case "with prejudice" because of Dr. Shalala's refusal.
