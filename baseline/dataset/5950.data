Some 15 years ago a totally unknown young Scot made a name for himself with an excellent book on the subject of defense. Since then, a string of equally valuable books on advanced play have given Hugh Kelsey a well-deserved place in any list of the world's best bridge writers.

His two latest offerings - ''Test Your Communications'' and ''Test Your Card-Reading'' - are in a series of monographs. Each provides the reader with 36 deals on which to exercise his talents, and, as usual in a Kelsey book, he is asked to study two hands before he has a chance to look at four. Each is available for $5.50 from the Bridge World, 39 West 94th Street, New York, N.Y. 10025.

The diagramed deal, from the book on communication, would deceive most players of intermediate rank and perhaps a few sleepy experts. A normal auction leaves South playing in three no-trump, and the opening lead is the heart four. Many declarers would happily play a small heart from dummy to make sure of three tricks in the suit. They would indeed score those tricks, but that is not a key issue. If they took a little time to plan, they would realize this. Ace Must Do the Work

To make nine tricks, South must develop one of the black suits, and clubs are distinctly more promising than spades. If South routinely plays low from dummy and wins East's heart queen with the ace, he can finesse the club jack. But when the ace does not collect the king, he is out of business: The diamond ace is the only entry to his hand, and he cannot use the clubs.
