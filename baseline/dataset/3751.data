Top Federal Reserve bank officials can now stay in their jobs longer.

In a policy change, the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System sent out letters this week to the Federal Reserve banks saying it had approved changes in the rules for the tenure of the highest officials at the 12 regional banks, by adding an optional exception to rules that govern their retirement.

Under the new policy, if appointed after the age of 55, a Fed bank president or first vice president would be allowed to stay in the job for 10 years, or until the age of 70. The president would have to retire when he or she met one of those provisions. Previously, presidents had to retire at 65. The exception can be granted by the individual Federal Reserve Bank's board.

''Mandatory retirement for presidents and first vice president of Federal Reserve Banks now has an optional exception,'' Peter Bakstansky, a spokesman for the New York Federal Reserve Bank, said.

The change could affect the tenures of some key Fed officials. William J. McDonough, the president of the New York bank, for example, could stay on for an extra few years. Mr. McDonough, who was named president of the New York Fed in July 1993, turns 63 next spring. Under the new regulations, he could continue to head the New York Fed until July 2003, when he would have completed 10 years in the job, at the age of 69.
