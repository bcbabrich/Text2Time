In LUCIANO GIUBBILEI: The Art of Making Gardens (Merrell, $70), the noted Italian landscape designer presents an ode to Great Dixter, Christopher Lloyd’s fabled East Sussex garden. Giubbilei asked Fergus Garrett, who became head gardener in 1993 and has been in charge of Dixter since Lloyd’s death in 2006, if he could visit for a while, working in the garden and hothouses, at a time when he felt a profound need for change. What follows, besides a coup de foudre for Dixter, is a loose meditation on the importance of craft, the appeal — and challenge — of simplicity and the beauty of “color that isn’t really color.” As you wander through Andrew Montgomery’s lush photographs of Dixter, as well as those of other projects Giubbilei has designed, you’ll find yourself agreeing with his credo: “Gardening . . . is a way to express deep feelings.”

For those of you — and your numbers are growing — gardening in drought-stricken parts of the country, Johanna Silver’s THE BOLD DRY GARDEN: Lessons From the Ruth Bancroft Garden (Timber Press, $34.95) will quench your thirst for inspiration. This dazzling three-and-a-half-acre succulent garden in Walnut Creek, Calif., was the Garden Conservancy’s first preservation project. Marion Brenner’s elegant photographs ably capture the architectural drama of its bold forms and eccentric groupings, as well as the strange and intriguing textures of individual agaves, cycads, euphorbias and sedums. Plump or spiny, tiny or looming, succulents have enormous variety and endless appeal. It seems almost criminal to avoid them in favor of lawns. Given the water restrictions in many Southwestern cities, we are seeing a new generation of dry designers. Bancroft, who is 107 years old, first planted her garden when she was 63; her children “attribute her longevity to drinking two glasses of milk and one of sherry each day.” Care of the gardener matters too.

We can’t hold Capability Brown entirely responsible for our fixation with lawns, but he certainly rolled out acres of thirsty, finicky green velvet. Even in his day, Capability was controversial. The poet Richard Owen Cambridge said he hoped to die before Brown so he could see heaven before Brown had “improved” it. Gardeners tend to be judgmental sorts. Can’t we all just agree that there’s plenty of room to accommodate many tastes? To that end, GARDENISTA: The Definitive Guide to Stylish Outdoor Spaces (Artisan, $40), by Michele Slatalla with the editors of the website Gardenista, celebrates our eclectic nature.

Slatalla is a garden dervish intent on taking us on a bracing romp through 13 of her favorites. You won’t find any pretensions about contemplating the beauty of a crack in the wall: these well-loved spaces are also well lived-in. I especially admired the colorful English cottage beds of the interior designer Ben Pentreath and the restful evergreen Brooklyn backyard of the creative director Mariza Scotch and her husband, Dièry Prudent (a fitness trainer whose outdoor studio is tastefully tucked away at the back), to say nothing of Slatalla’s own bountiful nest in Mill Valley, Calif. Slatalla is warm, approachable, lively — and chic. But she lets us in on everyone’s secrets with sections labeled “Steal This Look,” whether you’re hankering for a French florist’s bucket or the “ultimate chicken coop.” She suggests ideas for paths, fire pits and foot showers; tips for drainage solutions; and a shopping directory that made me reach for my credit card.

The Californians Sarah Lonsdale, a co-founder of the website Remodelista, and Louesa Roebuck, an artist and floral designer, share their adventures with FORAGED FLORA: A Year of Gathering and Arranging Wild Plants and Flowers (Ten Speed Press, $40). The “-ista” ladies (Slatalla and Lonsdale are colleagues) share a hip, confident, cheerful vibe, casual but studied. Amazingly, Lonsdale and Roebuck find all the flower-arranging beauty they need along local trails and roads, even on construction sites. The book opens with a stunning riff on fennel. Play with scale, they urge. Bring in the weeds, use unusual vessels, hang flowers from the rafters or lay them out on a long table or tack them to the edges of shelves. Whatever you do, enjoy their beauty and let your imagination loose. My favorite installation was at a tea business in Lagunitas, Calif., draped with wisteria, roses, apple blossoms and redbud — collected after two days of foraging. For the truly adventurous, there’s also a recipe for Candied Rose Petals or Mint Leaves.

When it comes to the big picture, not much is in our control. That’s why we cherish small moments of beauty, whether found or made. The photographer Ngoc Minh Ngo celebrates people who make beauty their life’s work with the gorgeous IN BLOOM: Creating and Living With Flowers (Rizzoli, $45). The textile and wallpaper designer Neisha Crosland covers the walls of her London house with chinoiserie-style flowers. The potter Frances Palmer imprints clay vessels with the vivid dahlias from her Connecticut garden. The horticulturalist Umberto Pasti celebrates Morocco’s rich floral history in tile and fabric. The painter Claire Basler rings rooms with floral murals in her French chateau, while in the Bronx, Livia Cetti cuts, dyes, crimps and folds paper into exquisite flower arrangements. Each place is wondrous; for those not lucky enough to have friends around to enhance life with such magic, Ngo’s enchanting photographs invite us in.

Getting down to earth, let’s end with the beginning: an egg. BABY BIRDS: An Artist Looks Into the Nest (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $28), by Julie Zickefoose, is as fascinating and unusual as it is endearing. Zickefoose says there’s “nothing like being a bird’s mama to acquaint you with how it behaves, looks and thinks.” For decades, she has been an “avian rehabilitator,” complete with federal permits to handle migratory birds; she once rescued four tiny hummingbirds when their nests blew down. It seemed a natural step to begin drawing the transformation nestlings make as they speedily develop after hatching.
