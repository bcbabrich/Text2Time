My restaurant review this week is of SD26, which Tony May and his daughter Marisa May recently opened off Madison Square Park in the Flatiron District. Mr. May is a legendary figure in New York restaurant circles. He was for almost 20 years the general manager of the Rainbow Room and later its owner; for almost another 20 years he was the owner and gracious host at San Domenico, on the south end of Central Park. He is worth taking seriously, as is his daughter, who cut her teeth at San Domenico and is an owner and gracious host at the new restaurant. Have you been to SD26? Do you wish to go? Do you recall meals at San Domenico worth sharing with other readers? Or at the old Rainbow Room? This is the place to post your comments, and to bear witness to the civil exchange of ideas.
