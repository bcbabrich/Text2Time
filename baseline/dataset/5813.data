Where have all the folkies gone? Those lone troubadours, battered guitars in hand, have all but disappeared from television and radio; they have either learned to lead bands, a la Joni Mitchell and James Taylor, or been banished from major record labels. Yet as it has since its invention, the guitar still provides full accompaniment in portable form, and some songwriters find that it's all they need. Even in the era of cantilevered haircuts and digital sound sampling, solo songwriters are still with us on a circuit of coffeehouses, clubs and independent record labels; recent releases include albums by Greg Brown, Christine Lavin, Fred Small, Billy Bragg and Phranc.

The folk guitar was once the most democratic of instruments, inexpensive and easy to get started on; a singer could learn three chords in an afternoon. Now, however, the guitar has been supplanted by light, cheap, battery-powered keyboards with built-in rhythm patterns, which don't even require calluses on a player's left hand. A songwriter who chooses to sling a guitar in 1985 is making an anti-style style statement, choosing the vibrations of strings and wood over the oscillations of microchips, the homespun over the high-tech. A keyboard player is a putative pop star; a guitarist, by connotation, is sincere.

The modern folkie tends to draw on the same traditions as Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan - blues and ballads and country songs and Tin Pan Alley - although the definition of folk music has long since expanded to embrace world music. Yet the lone guitarist of the 1980's isn't exactly an echo of the 1960's. Recent collections on Vanguard (''Greatest Folksingers of the 1960's'') and Elektra Records (''Bleecker and MacDougal'') are a reminder that the 1960's folk boom was partially a rediscovery of old folk and blues tunes, partially a political movement and, less often, an outlet for personal songs. In folkie songs of the 1980's, personal and political messages intertwine. The songs tell stories instead of making political pronouncements, but unlike the confessional songs of the 1970's, their stories are likely to make a social point.

Greg Brown measures the gap between hippie and yuppie in the first song on his fourth solo album, ''In the Dark With You'' (Red House Records, P.O. Box 4444, St. Paul, Minn. 55104), ''Who Woulda Thunk It'' - about how the longing for creature comforts creeps up on former rebels. Mr. Brown, who performs on National Public Radio's ''Prairie Home Companion,'' sings in a deep baritone growl that can be wry and comforting like a latter-day Dave van Ronk, counterpointed on the album by finger-picked guitar and mandolin and reedy accordion or harmonica. He has a knowing way with everyday details, particularly when he's writing about hard times in ''Just a Bum'' and ''All the Money's Gone.'' His album is homey and down-to-earth, and Mr. Brown is anything but self-important; in the album's title tune, he sings, ''I know less all the time/ Kiss me before I prove it's true.''
