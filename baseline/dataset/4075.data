Dr. Moore, director of the Economic Cycle Research Institute in New York, cautioned that he was making only a preliminary warning, though an aide asserted that Dr. Moore correctly predicted in February 1990 that subpar growth then would deteriorate into the full-blown, though brief, recession that began that July.

A recent Dun & Bradstreet survey of 3,000 business executives found a general ''wait and see'' stance, with those in small business least sanguine. ''Small businesses can be very sensitive to early changes in the economy,'' noted Joseph W. Duncan, the company's chief economic adviser. ''Their new pessimism may be an early sign that conditions will soften in the first half of 1997.''

In the same vein, economists at UBS Securities are telling clients that consumer spending ''continues to sputter'' and that both housing and exports will contribute only slightly, if at all, to growth in coming months.

''Expansions do not necessarily die of old age, but they become feeble,'' the bank's analysts say, predicting that the Fed will have to cut short-term interest rates next year because of ''below trend growth.''

History also shows that recessions have a way of popping up in the years after Presidential elections. Half the 10 postwar downturns, occurred at such times -- in 1953, 1957, 1969, 1973 and 1981, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.

And history also shows that despite the intense scrutiny that every indicator now gets, recessions can still arrive with little notice. In the summer of 1990, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said he saw no sign of a downturn even though the National Bureau later determined that it had already started. Because it takes time to evaluate economic data thoroughly, the researchers did not declare the recession under way until the spring of 1991, about the time it ended.

Indeed, in raising the specter of recession this week, Mr. Dole seemed to reflect Republican chagrin about a small but seemingly fiendish lack of congruence in the business and electoral cycles.

President George Bush, most analysts believe, lost his 1992 re-election bid in large part because most people thought the economy was doing poorly. But it was actually growing at a brisk 3 percent pace in the third quarter of that year and boomed at a robust 4.3 percent rate in the three-month period that included Election Day. President Clinton, by contrast, is getting credit for a strong economy when growth in the pre-election quarter was not only below that under President Bush but weakening.
