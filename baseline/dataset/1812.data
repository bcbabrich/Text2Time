Updated, 6:44 p.m. | STAMFORD, Conn. — After traveling to New York City to rouse phone-bank volunteers making calls for Senator John McCain, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman returned to his home state of Connecticut for yet another event to promote Mr. McCain’s White House candidacy. Mr. McCain is scheduled to hold a campaign rally at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Conn., at 1 p.m. on Sunday.



Mr. Lieberman lost the Democratic primary to Ned Lamont in 2006, but went on to win re-election to a fourth term, as an independent. Since then, he has caucused with the Democrats but often voted with Republicans. His support for Senator John McCain’s run for the presidency is no different.

At the Stamford Government Center this afternoon, Mr. Lieberman joined Representative Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut, to discuss Mr. McCain’s visit to Connecticut. They plan to join Mr. McCain during his visit to Fairfield.

Mr. Shays said that Mr. McCain did not need to visit to win the Republican primary in Connecticut. “He’ll probably win this state without coming, but he wants to say thank you to Joe,” Mr. Shays said.

Democrats across the state have expressed outrage at Mr. Lieberman’s endorsement of a Republican candidate. But Mr. Lieberman said it would be “irresponsible” of him to not support the candidate he thought was best for the job, “just because of party lines.”

“I know it’s unusual for a Democrat to support a Republican but it’s not unusual for normal people to do that,” he said. “People vote for the best person for office.”

“Good point,” said Mr. Shays, nodding in agreement.

Mr. Lieberman, in keeping with his positions on foreign policy and the war in Iraq and against Islamic terrorism, said the main reason why he supports Mr. McCain is because he is an “instant world leader.”

“He’s ready to be the commander in chief at a time when we’re at a war with Islamic terrorists,” he said. “He’s ready to lead us to victory in the war,”

Mr. Lieberman stressed Mr. McCain’s independent political tendencies as a reason he was supporting him. He mentioned that Mr. McCain was for stem cell research and was also one of the first Republicans to address global warming seriously.

“I think McCain is a Connecticut kind of political leader,” said Mr. Lieberman. “We never hesitate to work across party lines.”

“He’s the kind of person who will shake things up.”

Mr. McCain will be good for Connecticut because he’s a straight talker, a listener and a man willing to acknowledge when mistakes are made, added Mr. Shays.

“He’s not an ideologue,” he said.

Mr. Lieberman was sure to point out that he respected both Senator Clinton and Senator Obama but that Mr. McCain had more experience.

When asked if he would consider running with Mr. McCain, should he earn the nomination, Mr. Lieberman said absolutely not, as he told The Associated Press in an interview this week. “I’ve been there and done that,” he told reporters in Stamford.

Nancy DiNardo, chairwoman of the Connecticut Democratic Party, issued a highly critical statement in response to Mr. Lieberman’s appearance in Connecticut with Mr. McCain:

I continue to be disappointed beyond words with Joe Lieberman, as are a lot of Connecticut Democrats — saddened, surprised, and truly disheartened by just how completely he has abandoned the Democratic principles that have guided him over the years and the Party whose members have supported him and helped him achieve his goals. As recently as 18 months ago, Senator Lieberman was telling us Democrats that he shares our values, and with the exemption of Iraq, that he agrees with us on the issues we care so much about — critically important issues like a woman’s right to choose, tax and economic policies, health care and education. Moreover, in July of 2006, Senator Lieberman even stated that he intended to work to help a Democrat get into the White House in 2008. His endorsement of Senator McCain means he either doesn’t care about the issues noted above, or he’s putting politics ahead of people. If you look at Senator McCain’s voting record, and campaign platform – on these, and many other issues we care about – you’ll understand why I am saying this. This is a man, Senator McCain, who proudly says he was a “foot soldier” in the Reagan Revolution. Senator McCain is wrong on the issues we Democrats care so much about—and he’s wrong by a lot. I am proud to stand with my fellow Democrats and announce that we as a Party will grow stronger and do everything in our power to make sure a Democrat is elected in November.
