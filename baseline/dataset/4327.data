There has been speculation that the Knicks are interested in Wilkins, although it would be difficult for New York to sign him. The Knicks are over the salary cap, and the largest salary slot they have to offer Wilkins is the $1.25 million slot vacated by Rolando Blackman, who will not be re-signed. It will take much more than $1.25 million to sign Wilkins, an All-Star forward. But if the Knicks were interested in creating more salary cap room for Wilkins by making a trade, Wilkins would be interested in the Knicks.

"I think adding Dominique to the Knicks would clearly make them the best team in the East," Steve Kauffman, Wilkins's agent, said yesterday. "I honestly have no idea if New York wants to try and work something out, but other people seem to think it's a perfect fit. I expect the phone to be ringing off the hook tomorrow. We'll see who calls."

New York selected two talented players in Wednesday night's draft, but it remains to be seen how quickly Monty Williams and Charlie Ward will be able to contribute.

Outside shooting and quickness were two of New York's biggest needs. Williams can shoot. Ward is quick. Both players will need to improve if they are to play regularly next season. But considering that Williams was selected No. 24 over all, and Ward No. 26, the Knicks said they felt fortunate that both players were still available.

"The talent was pretty evenly matched after the 10 or 12 players, but we had Monty Williams rated much higher than No. 24," said Ernie Grunfeld, the Knicks' general manager. "He can shoot and we think he's a fine player. And Charlie, obviously, is a great athlete."
