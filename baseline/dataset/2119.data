Senator Charles E. Schumer was the keynote speaker today at a lunch set up by State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli during the state Democratic Party’s annual meeting in Nassau County.

Taking the lectern, Mr. Schumer praised Mr. DiNapoli, then offered what some interpreted as a minor jibe at Gov. Eliot Spitzer. “Thank you, Tom, for that wonderful introduction — but more importantly, so many of us in this room knew you what a great comptroller Tom DiNapoli would be,” Mr. Schumer said.

It was, perhaps, a pointed reference to the only state Democrat who was once vocal in his opinion that Mr. DiNapoli would not be a great comptroller. That was Governor Spitzer, who called Mr. DiNapoli “thoroughly and totally unqualified” for the job when the former assemblyman was about to be selected by the Legislature.

Since then, notably, Mr. Spitzer has mended fences with Mr. DiNapoli, recently calling him a man “of absolute integrity.” In turn, Mr. DiNapoli has offered support for the governor during some recent troubles, being first out of gate (or so we recall) with a press release supporting Mr. Spitzer after P. David Soares, the Albany County district attorney, absolved his administration of wrongdoing in the so-called Choppergate scandal.

And today Mr. Schumer himself went on to praise Mr. Spitzer, saying that he spoke to the governor often and vowing to work with him to overturn the Bush administration’s new policy restricting federally financed health care for children.

After the event, Mr. Schumer was asked if he supported Mr. Spitzer’s plans to give driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants. The senator demurred. “I haven’t studied any of the details,” he said.
