The United Nations Drug Control Program says in a report made public today that Afghanistan is now not only the largest producer of opium but is also becoming a major manufacturer of heroin, which is contributing to a rise in addiction throughout the region.

The report, prepared for a meeting here on Monday of Afghanistan's six neighbors plus the United States and Russia, says that Pakistan and Iran now have some of the world's highest rates of addiction to heroin, which is derived from opium. ''Central Asian countries show alarming signs of fast-increasing abuse rates,'' it says.

Afghanistan is encircled by Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and a far-western corridor of China.

''The number of heroin addicts in the region exceeds that of Western Europe and is still on the increase,'' says the report, prepared by Pino Arlacchi, executive director of the United Nations office for drug control and crime prevention. The report adds that communities of addicts in the region are seen as easy targets for organized crime and vectors for the spread of AIDS.
