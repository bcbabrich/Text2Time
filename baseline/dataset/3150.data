Europe's biggest tire maker, Michelin, warned that operating income this year would be 6.2 percent to 6.8 percent of revenue, down from an initial forecast of 7.7 percent to 8.3 percent, because of the slowdown in the United States, a weak global market for truck tires and the high cost of rubber, which is priced in dollars. Michelin said first-half operating income dropped 9 percent, to 491 million euros ($430 million) from 540 million euros last year, on a 4.5 percent increase in revenue, to 7.7 billion ($6.7 billion) from 7.4 billion euros. Michel Rollier, Michelin's chief financial officer, said the company could not rule out that those difficulties would not spill into 2002. One bright spot appeared to be the sale of 4 million tires to Ford to help replace 13 million Firestone tires Ford considers potentially hazardous. John Tagliabue (NYT)
