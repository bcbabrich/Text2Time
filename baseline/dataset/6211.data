JERUSALEM, Dec. 1 In—a special six‐hour session, the Israeli Cabinet decided today to boycott next month's debate on the Middle East in the United Nations Security Council and approved in principle the establishment of new settlements on the occupied Golan Heights.

The unusual Monday Cabinet session was called in response to the Security Council action last night linking the renewal of the United Nations peace‐keeping force on the Golan Heights to a full‐scale debate on the Middle East with Palestinian participation.

Israel accepted the sixmonth renewal of the peacekeeping force today but der flounced the Council's linking of the extension of the mandate with the Middle East debate, terming it a surrender to Syrian pressure.

In a long statement issued after the Cabinet meeting, the Government contended that the Security Council decision would sabotage peace efforts in the region it also reaffirmed its determination not to negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization in any forum and stated that it would not cooperate in any way with the debate in the Security Council next month.
