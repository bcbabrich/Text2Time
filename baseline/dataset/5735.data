''The trouble with most raspberry jam,'' says Rose Levy Beranbaum, ''is that it has too much sugar in it, and if you try to cut back on the sugar the pectin won't jell the jam.''

But Mrs. Beranbaum, whose cooking school, Cordon Rose, specializes in pastries and chocolate, was undaunted by the prospect of creating a low-sugar jam without any added pectin. Pectin is a carbohydrate that occurs naturally in some fruits, such as apples, and causes a gel to form when the fruit is cooked. Raspberries do not have the natural pectin to turn them into preserves without a little help from powdered pectin.

Mrs. Beranbaum wanted a jam in which the tartness and fruitiness of the berries was not masked by the sugar, so she turned her kitchen into a laboratory and set to work. It took her only three attempts -over a three-year period - to perfect the technique. It produces a jam that is intensely fruity and very tart, so tart that some people might be inclined to add a bit more sugar. Mrs. Beranbaum says that will not affect the intense berry flavor because her cooking method concentrates it.

Required: Time and a Sieve

Although the technique is quite different from ordinary jam-making, it is not difficult. It does, however, take time. Batches of the fruit are cooked down, combined with the sugar syrup and cooked again. Because the berries become so concentrated it is important to sieve the jam and eliminate some of the seeds; they can be used to make raspberry vinegar.
