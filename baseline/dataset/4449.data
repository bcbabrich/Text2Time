If Thursday's concert by Nicolas Collins, Joel Ryan, Ray Edgar and the Soldier String Quartet at the Kitchen had a collective message, it was similar to the one that music has been getting recently from the downtown school of electricity. The traditional artistic process is upended: no more the stepwise progression from materials to technique to beautiful object; now the art is in the materials themselves. How they are organized is anticlimax.

Midway through the evening, Mr. Ryan unwound wire across the stage, plugged it into a terminal and strolled back and forth, manipulating its length and rubbing it with a bow. Synthetically generated metaphors for human gesture and man-made sounds boomed and creaked from loudspeakers. The process was repeated a little later through the proximity of hand-held objects to various microphones.

This dialogue between man and machine had been introduced a few minutes before in Mr. Collins's "Broken Light," in which fragments of the Italian Baroque are electronically accelerated, spit out and responded to by the Soldier's four players. Whether by accident or on purpose, there was more a sense of music here than in the two Collins items that came before. "Lightning Strikes Not Once but Twice" and "Sound for Picture," two vignettes on the blind and the deaf, seemed more interesting for their narratives than for the bland electronic sound behind them.

Mr. Edgar's "Flexsonica II" found the performer, hands wired for sound, bending and caressing a metal bar. Here, an engineer of sorts happily shared empirical discoveries in sound. This Cybertronics series continues on April 16 and 17. Brush up on your applied science. This is a little like a visit to a new-inventions fair.
