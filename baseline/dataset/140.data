BRIDGETON, N.J. — A mother refused to let her 13-year-old daughter walk alone to the convenience store just two minutes away. A father barricaded his front porch with chairs to stop his daughter from wandering down to play on the sidewalk. Another mother snapped at her two-year-old son every time he waddled over to their yard’s gate.

Parents in this rural community in southern New Jersey have been haunted by the same question for the last two weeks: What happened to little Dulce Maria Alavez ?

The disappearance of Dulce , 5 — and the possibility she was abducted in the daytime from a local park — has gripped the region, shattering the sense of security intrinsic to any small town.

But in Bridgeton, a tight-knit enclave of mostly Latino immigrants, the case has thrust residents into the heated, national discourse over immigration and xenophobia from which they had been mostly insulated.
