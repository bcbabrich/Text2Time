Youth is life's period of resistance, if not revolt, so it was not surprising to see that Saturday evening's large crowd at the Washington Square Church was predominantly made up of young people. They came to hear the vocal music of North India as practiced by Pandit Jasraj and Swapan Chaudhuri. Mr. Jasraj is a singer of great range but is perhaps most powerful in his bass and baritone range. Mr. Chaudhuri plays the tabla.

What music could be more in opposition to ours? The European tradition is obsessed with beginnings and endings, a sense of temporal finiteness carved out of infinity. In this Indian vocal tradition, however, music starts and ends when it pleases, though at the same time confining itself to the most rigidly channeled use of given designs.

This obeisance to the notes of a specific scale and their co-relatives is the kind of restriction that would stifle Westerners, for whom modulations and harmonic development have become major avenues of expression. Indian music seeks freedom in its self-imposed stasis, while the European-American composer finds it in restlessness and exploration.

Mr. Jasraj provides powerful evidence that the barriers set up by these age-old sequential patterns, ornamental conventions and set scales are in the long run illusory. The implication is that the liberation of musical ideas lies in the microcosm and not beyond the next frontier.
