To the Editor:

While I'm sure Dr. Stephen G. Baum's medical credentials are impeccable, he must be aware that he exhibits certain nonprofessional prejudices in his statement that the common denominator in the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome has been promiscuity (letter, Oct. 21). Certainly it contributes; promiscuity also increases your chance of getting other diseases, including the common cold.

It was a loaded statement tantamount to saying that those who get AIDS deserve it for their life style. My layman's knowledge of the disease is that it is contracted by a virus entering the bloodstream. Are hemophiliac children who are unfortunate enough to receive tainted blood transfusions promiscuous? Can Dr. Baum state categorically that the disease could never be contracted via one exposure, or that a person having sex two times a year might unluckily choose the wrong partners?

I fully concur that AIDS education should be a part of sex education and that promiscuity will increase the risk of contracting contagious and infectious diseases. But indirectly labeling AIDS victims as promiscuous is unfortunate and certainly inaccurate. CHARLES ALMON Brooklyn, Oct. 22, 1986
