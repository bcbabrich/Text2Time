To the Editor

Your report (front page, Dec. 31) that a compromise by Senators Trent Lott and Tom Daschle may include a provision for a two-thirds majority in order to hold a Senate trial of the President is disturbing. The pretext for this hurdle is that since the 67 votes required for a conviction are lacking at present, no trial at all should be held.

If that same premise were extended to all trials, the accused and accuser would make brief presentations and jurors could decide matters of fact on any basis they wish.

This Clinton fiasco has already seriously damaged the integrity of American courts. This proposal benefits from a deceptively judicial air, while predetermining the outcome in a way that further debases our courts.
