Why should anyone with a point-and-a-half lead and just three rounds to go in a tourney of top class players work hard to win more games? The Bulgarian grandmaster Veselin Topalov found out in the Madrid International Tournament, which ended in early June. After six rounds, he had set himself at a comfortable pace of draws to cruise safely into solo first place. But he reckoned without the remarkable zeal and energy of the Alexei Shirov, a grandmaster formerly of Latvia who now lives in Spain.

Shirov put on a three-game winning streak that allowed him to overtake Topalov and share first place. As improbable as that was, Shirov is the man for that kind of effort. He habitually takes the kind of risk that often leads to such glamorous deeds. The moral is that Topalov should not have counted him out.

In the seventh round, Shirov daringly offered a pawn against his former Soviet colleague the grandmaster Valery Salov and won the game that started him on his final surge.

The bluntest way of knocking out the e4 pawn is the 1 . . . d5 2 ed Qd5 of the Center Counter Game, for which Black concedes White a tempo with 3 Nc3. Once considered primitive, it has taken its place in the storehouse of current openings.
