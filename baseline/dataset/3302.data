Re ''Population Shift in the West Raises Wildfire Concerns'' (front page, May 30):

The growing propensity of Americans to take up residence in fragile landscapes -- whether forests, mountains, deserts, wetlands or barrier islands -- is, or should be, a source of national concern. Their expectation, shared apparently by certain elected politicians, that the rest of us taxpayers should bail them out when disaster strikes or even threatens is, or should be, a national disgrace.
