WASHINGTON. June 30—The Carter Administration is developing a contingency energy conservation program, including such mandatory provisions as gasoline rationing, import quotas and forced closings of service stations, Administration officials said today.

The two‐pronged program would attempt to deal on one level with emergency problems that would occur in another oil embargo or other form of supply interruption. Perhaps more important, the program could function as a permanent allocation system, to be used if the energy measures now under consideration in Congress fail to solve the nation's energy problem.

Both the emergency and the nonemergency purposes of the program grew out of increasing fears that world supplies of oil and natural gas might grow increasigly tight by the 1980's, despite the Administration's current efforts, and that the balance of energy power might shift even more precipitously to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting countries.

This has prompted within the Administration a renewed conviction that a more foreceful emergency plan is needed because of the nation's growing dependence on imported oil. Imported oil has grown from 39 percent of domestic consumption in 1975 to 44 percent in 1976.
