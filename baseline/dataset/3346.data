Mr. Fischl, at any rate, is a star. He hit it in the early 80's with his figurative paintings, many of which involved disturbing sexual and social images in the supposedly safe setting of the suburbs. Mr. Fischl knew the suburbs, having been a Port Washington kid. One of his most talked about early works was ''Bad Boy,'' in which a woman lies naked on her bed while a young man reaches surreptitiously into her purse. This year a painting, ''Noonwatch,'' sold for $1 million. Mr. Fischl and his wife, April Gornick, a highly regarded landscape artist, have a home in Sag Harbor and a duplex in the Village.

This is all very impressive for someone, who, as Mr. Fischl says, ''wasn't a good kid.''

Mr. Fischl's father was a salesman. His mother? A brief pause, then an equally brief description. ''Housewife.'' Mr. Fischl speaks of flunking out of his first college; of living as a hippie in San Francisco; of his parents moving to the Southwest. But what he seems to enjoy discussing most is his work. He speaks wryly of trends in the art world, dryly funny in the style of Steve Martin and Mike Nichols, who are collectors and friends. When Mr. Fischl talks art, it is often Art Forum sort of stuff:

''I was of a mind that you could paint from experience towards experience.'' Something feels as if it's missing. Could he give us a better sense of his parents?

The answer comes back so bluntly and directly it is like a shot.

''My mother was a ferocious alcoholic who ultimately killed herself,'' Mr. Fischl says. ''My father was trying to hold the whole thing together as best he could. And they just had this incredibly intense, really horrible relationship. She died in a car accident -- went out extremely drunk, to run herself off the road. I was 22. She did not want to live. That's what I think.''

WHY was Mr. Fischl's mother so unhappy?

''Aha, the mystery of mysteries,'' Mr. Fischl says with a bitter and slightly unpleasant edge. ''I always thought she just lacked discipline. She was very creative and her fantasy of herself was as an artist, and she always approached everything as if it had to be a masterpiece or it wasn't worth doing. She tried everything: painting, sculpture, crafts, writing, but every time she put something out it was never good enough, it humiliated her.''

The painting ''Bad Boy'' shows a boy seemingly taking money from a purse. Was that boy ever Mr. Fischl?
