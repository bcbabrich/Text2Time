So buyers who feel little nostalgia for the LP era may feel shortchanged by the new reissues. Obviously, the recital records could have been combined in a multidisk set, with the original breakdown of programs indicated in the booklet. Still, the recordings sound splendid, and it is good to have them all back.

The ''Poliuto'' performance, which shows Callas at a crossroads in her career, has circulated in pirated recordings and, for some years, on the Melodram label; this is its first EMI release (65448; two CD's). When she appeared in this production, which opened the 1960 season at La Scala, Callas had been absent from the company for two years, because of an acrimonious dispute with its director, Antonio Ghiringhelli. It was a time of vocal insecurity for her. Her decision to return in a role new to her, from a little-known opera dominated by a tenor, bewildered many Callas fans at the time.

The opera, based on a play by Corneille and set in Armenia in the third century, deals with a spiritual crisis of the nobleman Poliuto, who converts to Christianity, risking persecution by the country's Roman occupiers. ''Poliuto,'' though a stylistic hybrid, is a work of ambition and grandeur, with crowd scenes anticipating the brassy Triumphal March of Verdi's ''Aida.'' The title role requires a tenor with lyricism and agility but also power and stamina. The Scala production, conducted sensitively by Antonio Votto, featured Franco Corelli, who lacked bel canto lyricism but had power galore.

Callas sings Paolina, Poliuto's wistful, deferential wife, who married him only after her true love, the Roman consul Severo, had (mistakenly) been reported killed. Paolina is so moved by Poliuto's courage in the face of persecution that in a transforming final scene, she follows him into the arena, where death awaits.

No doubt Callas chose this role in part because it allowed her a cautious way back into a company with which she had had a pivotal if tumultuous relationship. But here, in any case, is a searching, intelligent artist, characteristically championing a neglected work and finding dramatic resonance and musical complexity in a role thought to be secondary. Her singing is sometimes shaky, with wobbly vibrato and chancy high notes. But this is a deeply felt, subtly phrased, arrestingly vivid portrayal. The sound quality is adequate, for a live recording. The audience interrupts with frequent ovations, which merely underscore the sense of event in Callas's difficult homecoming.

The ''Live in Concert'' set (72023; two CD's) begins with Callas in 1935, not yet 12, singing ''Un bel di'' from Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly'' on the ''Major Bowes Amateur Hour'' radio broadcast. Because her father was opposed to her performing in public, she had to use a pseudonym, Nina Foresti. For a pre-teen-ager, the voice, though tremulous, is remarkably bright and full of temperament.
