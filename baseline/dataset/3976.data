After Adam was killed, his three brothers and an infant sister were removed from the parents' custody. That would seem to have been an easy call. Take the children away and never send them back. Period.

So the plan, for a while, was to try to have the youngsters adopted.

Enter Terry Weiss, an assistant deputy commissioner in the city's child welfare agency. In June 1994, Ms. Weiss changed the plan. She decided that the long-term goal should be to return the boys to their parents. (Adoption proceedings are under way for the girl, who is now 6.)

The question arises: How many of their children's bones do parents have to break, and how many children do they have to kill, before a decision is made by the authorities that they are no longer eligible for custody?

Obviously, in the view of certain key child welfare officials, Rufus Chisolm (who is still in prison) and Michelle Mann (who was released in 1994) have not achieved the necessary threshold of horror that would bar them from further considerations of custody. Perhaps if they kill one more child.

In a deposition taken last January, Ms. Weiss acknowledged that the boys were experiencing severe problems. She was asked, "In your view, did their serious emotional and psychological problems weigh in favor of changing the plan to return to parent, or weigh in favor of maintaining the goal of adoption?"
