New Voices Take Over In the Met's New 'Butterfly' 'Madama Butterfly' Metropolitan Opera

After a few weeks' rest, Giancarlo del Monaco's naturalistic new production of Puccini's "Madama Butterfly" returned to the Metropolitan Opera on Tuesday evening with new singers in all the major roles. But the biggest vocal star in the new slate, Placido Domingo, was not onstage but on the podium, conducting the work for the first time at the Met.

Mr. Domingo aquitted himself creditably, leading the orchestral interludes and underpinnings with all the lyricism and lugubriousness Puccini demands, but also with a current of nervous energy that gave the drama an edge. His conducting gestures were energetic and detailed, and the orchestra played well for him.

The new Cio-Cio-San, Diana Soviero, restored some of the vulnerability that had been wrung out of the production early in the season, but some iron remains. She began the evening in good vocal form, sometimes spinning out a seductively smooth sound. But at times she seemed short of breath, and there often seemed no connection between her upper and lower registers. The timbre changes between the highest and lowest passages in "Un bel di" were so broad as to sound like two distinct voices.

Pinkerton, in this production, is thuggish and one-dimensional, a pity because when his ambiguities are erased so are the reasons one is shocked by him. Michael Sylvester's compliance with this conception pointed up another of its flaws: the lyricism he brought to the music was entirely at odds with the oily, loathesome character he portrayed.
