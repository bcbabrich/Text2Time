With the election only three days away and political partisanship at a high pitch, the police force made its “maximum” effort to protect President Johnson during his visit to the city yesterday.

For the first time during a Presidential visit, a department spokesman said, patrolmen and detectives assigned to administrative and clerical duties—600 in all—were ordered on to the streets.

“It's not just to protect the President,” the spokesman said. “We don't want people to get the idea that the rest of the city is without police so we're giving it the maximum effort.”

Although the department, in keeping with past practice, would give no figures on the number of men assigned to the President, the total was estimated at 5,000.
