As a civilian, Ms. Hoster cannot be forced to testify in the preliminary proceeding, known as an Article 32 hearing.

But the presiding officer of the hearing, Lieut. Col. Robert Jarvis, said today that he would explore having Ms. Hoster recalled to active duty temporarily so that she could be required to appear at the hearing. To do that, he would have to obtain the agreement of Army Secretary Togo D. West Jr..

The witness today said that she did not file charges against Sergeant Major McKinney for several months, believing that what had happened to her was an isolated incident. She said she changed her mind after hearing Ms. Hoster's account, believing that she had an obligation to support Ms. Hoster.

The chief petty officer described how she found Sergeant Major McKinney staring at her on the first day of the benefits conference. On the third day, she said, he asked to speak with her outside the hotel and told her that he was nervous but that he could not leave Denver without telling her how attractive she was.

''Everything I said to him he turned around into another pickup line,'' she testified. ''When I said I was nervous, he said I was 'nervous like a schoolgirl' and, 'I'll make you feel like a woman.' ''

As she testified, Sergeant Major McKinney sat impassively in the small room.

The woman, who is to be cross-examined by his lawyer on Tuesday, said the non-comissioned officer had told her that she struck him ''as a woman in need of some passion'' and that if she went to his room she would be exposed to passion like she had never experienced before.

She said she told him that she was flattered but that she was happily married and that going to his room would make her feel guilty. She said he replied: '' 'If you come up to my room, I promise you'll never feel guilty.' ''
