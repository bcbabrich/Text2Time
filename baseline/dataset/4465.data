In the past, Allen Ginsberg's poetry has often raged and mourned. But Mr. Ginsberg was in a genial mood when he collaborated with Cyndi Lee on "The Beat Suite," a new work presented by the Cyndi Lee Dance Company on Sunday afternoon at the 14th Street Dance Center of the Educational Alliance's Emanu-El Midtown Y.M.-Y.W.H.A.

Ms. Lee's choreography was equally amiable. At various times, the dancers (Matthew Carmody, Amy Cox, Eric Diamond, Steffany George and Philip Karg) wandered wistfully, bounced up and down, and set their limbs happily twitching while Mr. Ginsberg, seated to their left, recited brief poems about such subjects as a melancholy, but never tragic, night and the joys of meditation. One poem even managed to be jolly about broken bones. The accompaniment included music by Mr. Ginsberg, played live on the guitar by Steven Taylor, and recorded pieces by Michael Blair, Bill Frisell and Steve Swallow.

The rest of the program was devoted to choreographically inventive energy studies by Ms. Lee. "Dunderhead Hoover," also a premiere, contrasted phrases in which Chico Katsube, Marie Pelletier, Barbara Thatcher, Ms. Cox and Ms. George moved together as a single unit with sequences in which individuals detached themselves from the group. A brief power failure near the conclusion shut off the music (a recording of the "Missa Luba") and turned out the lights. But the dancers continued gallantly in silence and semidarkness.

Other works came from the company's repertory. Ms. Cox was sometimes rooted to one spot and at other times bounding about in "Gospel." Mr. Carmody, Mr. Diamond and Mr. Karg appeared to swim and dive through space in "Swimming on Empty." The arms of Lisa Powers and Ms. Lee both glided calmly and stretched tautly in "Merton." And "Big Clock," a solo for Ms. Lee, was filled with so many odd percussive movements that she resembled an eccentric inventor's automaton.
