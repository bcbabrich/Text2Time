Kelsey--Harvey Jr. The Jay Heritage Center is saddened by the passing of a cherished friend, Harvey Kelsey Jr. He demonstrated a lifelong love and respect for the natural world and valued the sylvan beauty of gardens, trails and open spaces. He gave freely of his time and counsel to many organizations within his community, offering honest insights where his opinion could make a positive difference and benefit more people outside himself. Harvey spurred us on in our work with his loyalty, his indominatable energy, his humor and his ability to sail beyond obstacles to any horizon. We will miss him greatly and extend our heartfelt condolences to his children, grandchildren, family and friends who continue his legacy.
