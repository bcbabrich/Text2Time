''The biggest surprise was the return of the public to the market,'' said Andrew Engel, senior research analyst at the Leuthold Group, a market research and money management firm in Minneapolis. And, he added, ''this was one of the big reasons for the rally.''

He said that he had expected it to take much longer for investors to regain confidence in stocks. But he said it now appeared that investors have become conditioned to thinking of the longer term and are willing, therefore, to jump back into the market quickly.

Abby Joseph Cohen, the head of the investment policy group at Goldman, Sachs, said that she saw signs that showed that some investors were still being cautious. But she added that the positive economic environment right now had made investors more willing to make bets that many companies with weak earnings now will do better in the future.

''When inflation and interest rates are low investors have more confidence in the durability of the economic cycle and are willing to extend their expectations for the economy and for the earnings of a particular company,'' she said.

Besides the big 2003 gains, investors also got a much less volatile market. Last year there were just 15 days on which the Dow rose or fell 2 percent or more, compared with 48 in 2002, 25 in 2001 and 31 in 2000, according to Scanshift, a Chicago research firm.

While there is no unanimity, many forecasters expect the stock market to continue to rise this year, but at a much slower pace. Mr. Engel of the Leuthold Group and Ms. Clayman of New Amsterdam Partners say they expect 10 percent growth in the S.&P. 500.

''The discordant thing is that the big winners have been the low quality stocks and the low-priced stocks,'' Ms. Clayman said. ''In order for the rally in these stocks to be justified you have to continue to see 20 percent to 30 percent earnings growth.''
