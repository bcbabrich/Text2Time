But the scene abruptly turned to carnage: 13 of the 73 injured were hurt seriously and two had limbs torn away, hospital officials said.

''This is a terrible outrage committed by people who have no humanity whatever,'' said Jack Straw, the Home Secretary. ''We are dealing with people who have warped minds, right-wing extremists who are obviously racist and homophobic. That we know.''

The explosion went off at 6:37 P.M. at the Admiral Duncan pub on the corner of Dean and Old Compton Streets. The start of the holiday weekend and the summery weather had drawn thousands of strollers, drinkers, tourists and theatergoers onto Soho's streets. The timing coincided with what would normally be a relaxed, busy time, with thousands of Londoners stopping to socialize after work.

The owners of the Admiral Duncan, Scottish & Newcastle Breweries, said there was no warning before the explosion. Witnesses said the blast left the injured and dead flattened on the sidewalk outside the pub. ''I thought they had been blown apart,'' said one witness, James Fullum. In the immediate aftermath, wounded people staggered out of the Admiral Duncan, described by gay rights advocates as a well-known and almost exclusively gay meeting place.

''I saw the whole front blown out and bodies lying around in the street,'' said Sean Given, the manager of another bar in the area.

Another witness, Peter King, said, ''It reminded me of my childhood during the war.''

Other Londoners said the explosion revived memories of Irish Republican Army bombings. ''Everyone is just very frightened about what's going on,'' John Laycock, a restaurateur, said on television.

Inside the pub, people were hurled to the ground. A hospital spokeswoman, Louise Boden, said most of the wounded were young men suffering ''burns, lacerations, the trauma of being thrown about.''
