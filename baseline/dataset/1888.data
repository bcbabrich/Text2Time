Democratic incumbents with large African-American constituencies are trying to soothe resentments incited by their support for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Raymond Hernandez reports.

For example, Brooklyn’s 10th Congressional District, home to more African-Americans than any other district in New York, gave Senator Barack Obama his highest margin of victory in the state. But the district’s longtime congressman, Edolphus Towns, did not share his constituency’s preference for Mr. Obama and now some of those voters are pushing to oust him.

An emerging young black political class is seeking to assert the neighborhood’s power against what it sees as an older establishment, based in Harlem, that has long exercised disproportionate influence in New York.

The tensions in the district echo those in a handful of races around the country. Even after Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton embraced in Unity, N.H., last Friday and sought to put their divisions behind them, some strains are still evident closer to the ground.

A Shortage of Bicycle Parking

At a time when the number of people cycling in New York is soaring, one glaring problem for those who want to bike to work is the shortage of parking, Colin Moynihan reports.

In a city inhabited by bike thieves so crafty and notorious that the bicycle lock company Kryptonite calls one of its locks the New York Fahgettaboudit, many people are loath to leave a bike chained outside, where it can be stolen or quickly stripped of parts.

Some commuters, who park on the street, try to throw off thieves by choosing a different spot each day or by moving their bike during lunch. Others depend on the good will of local business owners who might be willing to squeeze a bike into a shop corner at no charge.

Even for those willing to park outdoors, space is limited. Although it is common for people to secure bicycles to signposts or parking meters, it is a violation of a city ordinance to lock a bike to anything other than a bicycle rack. In addition, many businesses and buildings post signs warning cyclists not to chain their bikes to fences or railings.

Bloomberg for Vice President (Times Two)

Clyde Haberman, in his About NYC column, asks: Why don’t both presidential candidates make Michael R. Bloomberg their running mate? After all, nothing in the Constitution seems to prohibit it.

“There’s nothing about parties in the U.S. Constitution to begin with,” said Nathan Persily, a law professor at Columbia University.

Richard H. Pildes, a law professor at New York University, said the main impediment might be state bans on “fusion candidacies.” This is an alien concept in New York, but most states have laws forbidding candidates to run under the banner of more than one political party.

But do those prohibitions apply to national candidacies? The situation may vary from state to state, Professor Pildes said. Also, “the vice presidency is such a weird thing because you don’t vote separately for the vice president,” he said. A credible argument, he suggested, might be made that any bans on fusion candidacies might not apply in this situation, “since we’re really voting for the president.”

Now, would Mr. Bloomberg move into the vice president’s official residence at the Naval Observatory in Washington or continue to bunk at his Manhattan town house, as he does now?
