When federal investigators began their study of the collapse of the twin towers in October, they planned to evaluate exactly how structural steel, floor supports, fireproofing and other building components gave way in a deadly sequence of failures after hijacked jets first rammed the towers and set them on fire.

But six months later, the investigators have concluded that they are unable to provide a comprehensive analysis of how well the buildings and their structural elements performed, and as a result, they cannot say if the buildings had specific weaknesses. That inability to determine if certain weaknesses existed, the investigators have concluded in a formal report, means they cannot responsibly answer the question of whether other buildings across the country might be vulnerable, as well.

The investigators are expected to make their findings public when they present their final report to Congress today in Washington.

The reason for that frustrating conclusion, the report says, is that national fire tests and standards proved virtually useless in evaluating how building components behaved in the raging fires that followed the plane impacts. Without a meaningful standard against which to measure the performance of the two towers, the investigators decided, there was no way to say fairly whether they held up adequately or failed before they should have.
