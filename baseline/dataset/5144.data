''The request voted by the 14 members of HEC is for either the use of the space or money from leasing the space,'' said Roger Wilder, 58 years old, who was one of the three people arrested Tuesday evening on trespassing charges. They will be arraigned Oct. 9 in Vermont District Court.

''The intent of the will is clear, and we believe the school board is progressively deviating from the will,'' Mr. Wilder said. The building was used for classrooms from 1938 until 1980, when most of the space was converted to administrative offices for the School Department, with the approval of the Probate Court.

In 1986, the department petitioned the court for the right to lease out the second floor to University Health Associates, a medical group associated with the University of Vermont, and the Lake Champlain Committee, a nonprofit environmental group. The first floor of the two-story building is occupied by a state program for emotionally disturbed children. The department takes in $30,000 in annual rental revenue, and the money goes to meet operating expenses for the school district.

The court allowed the change of use but restricted the terms of the leases to five years.

''It is our position - and the Probate Court's interpretation - that we are using the building within the parameters of the will,'' said Paul Danyow, the Superintendent of Schools in Burlington.

''The board is not ready to dispose of that building because of the fluidity of the school population,'' he said. ''We're seeing increased enrollments in the lower grades. We may need that school again.''
