NEW DELHI, Oct. 31 - Two days after a series of bombs tore through this capital in one of the deadliest terrorist attacks here, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told the president of Pakistan on Monday that there were indications of links to outside groups and that Pakistan must act to prevent terrorism against India.

Mr. Singh made his remarks in a telephone conversation with the Pakistani leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who called to express his condolences for the bombings, in which about 60 people were killed.

Although Mr. Singh, in a statement to news organizations after the call, did not identify Pakistan in his reference to external links, there has been widespread speculation in this country since Saturday evening that Pakistani-linked militant groups fighting over Kashmir may have been involved in the attacks. No one has been arrested in connection with the blasts.

Also on Monday, an Indian court sentenced a Pakistani and six Indians who had links to a militant group suspected in the attacks on Saturday for an attack five years ago on the historic Red Fort in Delhi.
