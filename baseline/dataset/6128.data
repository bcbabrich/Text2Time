WASHINGTON, Dec. 2 — Attorney General Griffin 13. Bell said today that he had ordered an investigation to determine whether any employee of the Dep4rtment of Justice had attempted to improperly influence the.appointment of the Wilted States Attorney in Pittsburgh.

The Attorney General announced the inlernal inquiry at a hastily called news conference in which he criticized an article: in today's issue of The New York Times that quoted unidentified sources in the Justice Department as saying that Belt and Associate Attorney General Mfchael J. Egan ‘had improperly delayed a full‐scale investigation into payments to one candidate for the job.

According to The Times account, Mr. Bell, responding to pressure from investigators in his ‘own department, delayed planned appointment of George E. Schumacher as United States Attorney. in Pittsburgh pending an inquiry into $60,000 in payments made to a Pennsylvania Congressman by. Mr. Schumacher's law firm. The Congressman, Representative Joseph M. Gaydos, is one of six = Democratic Representatives from western Pennsylvania who recommended Mr. Schumacher for the position.

Federal officials have said that,. under repeated questioning in the last four months, Mr. Schumacher and Mr. Gaydos have given contradictory explanations for the payments, which were made over four years beginning in the early 1970's. Mr. Bell said it was incorrect to say that he had delayed the appointment “under pressure from investigators in his own department,” as the news article said. He also disagreed with the article's reference to the process as a “planned appointment” of Mr. Schumacher.
