A sleek little black-lacquer bar is at the entry, then down several steps is a multilevel dining area done in gray felt wallpaper with cozy cranberry banquettes, a marble floor, potted palms, artful lighting, fresh flowers and crisp linen (set with knives and forks, which you can exchange for chopsticks). The soft surfaces minimize background noise.

A winning starter on the menu since the beginning is chicken soong, which is typically made with squab. This version is a sprightly combination of minced chicken, celery, peppers and carrots in a pocket of iceberg lettuce. Sesame noodles were a letdown, though, flaccid and mired in too much sauce. All of the dumplings can be recommended, especially the steamed spinach and coriander, nicely browned pan-fried dumplings filled with pork, and the spicy Sichuan won tons, also pork-filled, which have a deep, lingering heat sensation. An off-menu favorite among many customers is called Grand Marnier shrimp (ask Mrs. Chu to recount the dish's accidental origins). The first time I tried it, it was reminiscent of something you would get at happy hour in a resort motel. This time it was less offensive, less sweet, but still not something I would go out of my way for.

Waiters here are extremely accommodating when it comes to ordering, and they make sure the dishes come out the way you prefer. Fu's has a good selection of domestic and imported beers and a better than average wine selection for a Chinese restaurant. My preference with this assertive food is a spicy gewurztraminer from Hugel ($14).

Among entrees, sesame-sprinkled beef is subtle and flavorful along with Shanghai bok choy and sweet red peppers. It has been noted before that orange beef here -- curiously not on the written menu -- is the best in town. You can also have orange chicken, which is much lighter yet with the same tart-sweet appeal. Hot and spicy lobster served out of the shell was not exciting the first time but excellent on a second tasting. The lobster meat was perfectly cooked and had a supporting cast of peas, carrots and red peppers that had a one-two punch of sweet and hot. A terrific pan-fried flounder is deboned at tableside and garnished with fresh ginger.

Fu's has always served one of the best Peking ducks around. A chef carves it at tableside, scraping excess fat from inside the skin. "We Chinese like the fat!" Mrs. Chu interjects. The duck rolls are indeed leaner than most, but still moist and delicious. The kitchen also turns out a good mildly spiced lamb dish with zucchini, carrots and scallions. Side dishes like dry sauteed string beans, Sichuan broccoli and eggplant family style are appealing enough to make a meal in themselves.

It is reassuring to see that Fu's and Mrs. Chu have not lost steam in their eight fast-paced years. For refined Chinese food in an urbane setting, Fu's still ranks at the top. La Reserve ***
