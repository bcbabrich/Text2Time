To the Editor:

The article ''Clues on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome'' (Nov. 24) stated that the practice of putting infants to sleep in the supine position has decreased deaths from SIDS. It would be more accurate to say that pediatricians advised the supine sleeping position during a time when the SIDS rate fell. A conclusion about cause and effect cannot properly be drawn from the available data. It is probable that many causes interact to produce such deaths.
