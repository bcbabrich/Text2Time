It was the kind of nightmare that executives at the Sony Corporation might have feared when they plunged into the music industry's volatile mix of talent, ego and money six years ago through their $2 billion acquisition of CBS Records.

There in the witness box last week sat one of Sony's most valuable assets, George Michael, the pop singer, whose first solo album, "Faith," sold 14 million copies after its release in 1988. He told the High Court in London that Sony may know how to manufacture a Walkman, but that it has no appreciation for the creative process. Saying he was disillusioned by Sony's unwillingness to allow him to grow as an artist, Mr. Michael demanded to be released from his long-term contract.

The scene was played out in front of the 40 or so spectators who could cram into the small public gallery, most of them young female fans of Mr. Michael who were admonished by the judge not to squeal or otherwise disrupt the proceedings.

But it held the attention of recording companies, artists and lawyers all over the world, who see in the case not just an unusually bitter and public split between a star and his label, but a legal test of the industry's practice of signing top stars to multi-album contracts.
