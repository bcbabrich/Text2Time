The nation's largest operator of welfare-to-work programs violated federal law by paying lower wages to women than to men placed in the same jobs in a Milwaukee warehouse, according to a decision made public yesterday by the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

The company, Maximus Inc., has been under mounting criticism for its business practices in recent months. A state judge in Manhattan has held up the Giuliani administration's plans to award Maximus more than $100 million in contracts to help welfare recipients find work. And state auditors in Wisconsin recently found that the company had billed the state for $466,000 in improper or questionable expenses.

The federal commission's ruling found that a woman placed in warehouse jobs by MaxStaff, the company's temporary employment agency, was paid $7.01 an hour while five male co-workers got $8.13.

''We're obviously very disappointed with the determination,'' said Rachael Rowland, a spokeswoman for Maximus. ''We respectfully disagree with it. We remain confident that no discrimination occurred in this case.''
