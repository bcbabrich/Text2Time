Back in 1981, President Reagan's first budget bravely proposed ending the $4 billion in annual farm subsidies that David Stockman, the Budget Director, reviled as ''organized larceny.'' Five years later, those subsidies are up to $30 billion and the Administration is still stumbling from plan to plan in an effort to appease wrathful farmers.

The latest initiative, timed for the Tuesday elections, would pay farmers to idle one-fifth of America's grain land. It might actually save the Treasury some money next year. But it's still a sorry substitute for the free-market design that has been buried by public sympathy for poor farmers and hard-nosed lobbying by the rich ones.

The Agriculture Department offers about $2 for every bushel of grain that qualified farmers agree not to plant next spring. That would set back the taxpayers about $2 billion. But in the loony-tunes world of farm subsidies, this could prove a bargain. If the grain were planted and grown, the Government would be legally obliged to buy and store it, at considerably higher cost. Farmers apparently like the new subsidy program too. Cash today for not planting next spring sure beats having to raise crops and risk losing them to weather or insects. And reducing total stocks of grain improves the prospects for future prices.

Economists may even rationalize new subsidies for not growing grain that partly offset existing subsidies encouraging production. The result could be output closer to private supply and demand. Lost in the political shuffle, though, is all pretense of a long-term strategy for returning American agriculture to the free market.
