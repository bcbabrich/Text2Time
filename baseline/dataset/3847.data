Inmates in the Georgia prison system have long complained of guards' brutality, and now a few guards, counselors and other prison employees are supporting inmates' contentions that on one occasion, the state prison commissioner himself condoned, watched and celebrated a mass beating.

The most recent account, a sworn statement by the lieutenant in charge of a riot squad at Hays State Prison in northwestern Georgia, alleges that a top aide to the prison commissioner touched off a bloody attack on prisoners in July 1996 when he grabbed an unresisting inmate by the hair and dragged him across the floor.

That same day, Commissioner Wayne Garner watched in another cellblock while inmates, some handcuffed and lying on the floor, were punched, kicked and stomped until blood streaked the walls, said Ray McWhorter, a riot squad lieutenant at the prison, in a deposition filed today in Federal District Court.

Later, Mr. McWhorter said, Mr. Garner applauded the guards at a celebratory chicken dinner.

''Everybody was high-fiving and shaking hands and congratulating each other and patting each other on the back and bragging about how much butt you kicked,'' Mr. McWhorter said in his deposition, part of a Federal lawsuit brought by state inmates last fall against the commissioner and others.
