Roni Horn Mary Boone Gallery 417 West Broadway (near Spring Street) SoHo Through Oct. 30

"When Dickinson Shut Her Eyes" is the title of Roni Horn's bare-bones sculpture installation, and the poems of Emily Dickinson are its subject. The work consists of dozens of square aluminum rods, each of which is a yard or two long and carries a line of verse in inlayed black plastic letters. Propped up against the gallery wall, the rods are gathered into clusters that make up complete poems.

The poems Ms. Horn has chosen are not among those often anthologized, and she seems to want to compound their unfamiliarity by making them difficult to read. In some lines, the letters are printed in mirror image, and the verse-bearing sides of the rods are consistently turned in different directions, preventing a direct, face-forward attention to the flow of the words.

One appreciates Ms. Horn's attempt to slow down consideration of Dickinson's work. But to reduce the poems to a game of hide-and-seek is surely the last thing Dickinson, who so exquisitely paced her linguistic surprises, would have wanted. In the end, the chief accomplishment of Ms. Horn's installation is to send one to the bookshelf to consult the matchless originals firsthand. HOLLAND COTTER
