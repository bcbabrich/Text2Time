WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 —North Vietnam turned over to the United States in Paris today the names of nine American prisoners — seven servicemen and two civilians—held by Communist forces in Laos. The list also included the name of a Canadian civilian.

American officials were privately disappointed by the list since they had hoped that it would contain a substantial number of the 311 servicemen whom the Defense Department had reported missing and the 6 men carried as prisoners in Laos. Officials emphasized that the United States would be seeking clarification on the status of men believed captured or missing.

The provision of the prisoner list for Laos removed one procedural hitch that had developed in the prisoner‐exchange program under the Vietnam cease‐fire agreement that was signed Saturday, and it presumably cleared the way for release of the prisoners, probably starting next week.

When the Communist side supplied information Saturday on prisoners it held, the lists—to the surprise of American ofoped in the prisoner‐exchange program under the Vietnam cease‐fire agreement that was signed Saturday, and it presumably cleared the way for release of the prisoners, probably starting next week.
