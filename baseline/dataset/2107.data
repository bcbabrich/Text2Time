A heavy underdog on the road playing the nation’s winningest football program at the famed Big House. Who could have ever predicted that Appalachian State, the top-ranked team in the Football Championship Subdivision team, would upset No. 5 Michigan, 34-32, today?

Perhaps the Mountaineers, the two-time defending national champions of the Football Championship Subdivision, formerly known as Division I-AA.

Prior to the game, Appalachian State Coach Jerry Moore said, “I don’t think we would take a bunch of people up there who wouldn’t play hard and wouldn’t compete.”

According to The Associated Press, “no Division I-AA team had beaten a team ranked in the AP poll from 1989-2006, and it’s unlikely that it happened after Division-I subdivisions were created in 1978.”

So where does Appalachian State’s stunning victory rank among college football’s greatest upsets? Could it indeed be the biggest upset ever?
