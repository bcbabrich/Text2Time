To the Editor,

Your Feb. 15 news article ''Green Fades From a Blueprint'' and your Feb. 26 editorial ''Reclaiming the Hudson,'' on the proposed riverside park on Manhattan's Upper West Side that calls for moving the elevated portion of the West Side Highway, omit some information.

You did not point out that the opportunity to move the highway had been missed by the previous City Hall and Albany administrations when they decided to rebuild the road as is, rather than reconstruct it as a surface road, even though this was the ultimate plan. This was a bad, expensive and inexplicable decision.

The idea of relocating the highway now -- with more than $70 million invested in rebuilding it -- is one that we cannot bring to taxpayers. Your editorial says that I call the park a ''luxury.''

I said it would be a ''luxury'' to move the road at a time in New York's history when government finally is removing its heavy hand from the pockets of taxpayers.
