The Sept. 11 attacks made this the deadliest year for police officers since 1974, although when victims at the World Trade Center are excluded, the number killed in the line of duty increased only slightly, two police organizations say.

The groups, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund and the Concerns of Police Survivors, said a total of 231 federal, state and local police officers were killed in 2001, up from 150 in 2000.

If those killed at the World Trade Center are excluded, the number is 160.

A total of 71 officers died at the trade center, the two groups said, among them 37 from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and 23 from the New York City Police Department.

The groups said the national toll of officers killed on duty had been rising since 1999, when it reached 130, the lowest level since 1965.
