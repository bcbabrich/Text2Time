Whenever I looked at a picture of Kate Moss I thought of Corinne Day, who died last Friday at her home in England. The two women, model and photographer, were linked long past Ms. Day’s first pictures in the early ’90s of the teenage Ms. Moss, and I suppose that is inevitable when a truth is revealed.

The plain, unaffected beauty that Ms. Day and other photographers captured was nowhere to be found in glossy fashion magazines or on the Paris or Milan runways. It was the era of aggressive sexuality, whether from Jean Paul Gaultier, Thierry Mugler or Gianni Versace, and the young photographers and stylists who worked in London, usually for very little money, could not identify with that view of women. And they knew there was something else going on; they only had to look around them.

The style was called grunge, but it plainly real and very human. I loved hearing the stories about that time from Melanie Ward, and though I didn’t know Ms. Day, I always admired her work. Her pictures told us that she knew something about the lives of the models she photographed, that she empathized with them. That was one of Ms. Day’s secrets. Fashion itself is boring. But keep looking. And witness her curiosity and grace in some of the pictures she took in 2004 and 2005, in particular Gemma Ward at Glastonbury. They’re gorgeous.
