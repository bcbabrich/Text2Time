“I had seen how well couple of major studio films about the South had done,” Mr. McClure recalls, “so figured I could make me some money by doing a few myself, especially if I turned out action thrillers filled with classic car chases, a little spin, some ‘shine, some bigbellied sheriffs, the usual Southernisms.”

He rounded up some backers, rented a few cameras and hired a handful of actors and technicians. Some of the technicians had no experience except what they had gained in college film courses.

“The director had to come down from New York,” Mr. McClure says, “because somebody had to know what to do. The shooting took 16 days—about a fourth the normal time — and we brought the whole thing in for less than $65,000, which would last Burt Reynolds and the ‘Gator’ cast about two days.

“Man, when it rained, we just wrote that in the script.” he said. “And since we were basically using nonunion labor, when we ran into an actor who belonged to the Screen Guild we just changed his name.”

At last count. Mr. McClure reports, “Preacherman” had grossed $5‐million in ticket sales. No one in New York or Chicago or Seattle has ever heard of the film‐or its stars, who remain as obscure as ever—but “Preach” has played 10 separate dates in Sanford, N.C., population 11,716.

“All the critics panned it, and one even nominated it for ‘worst flick of the year,'” Mr. McClure says with a chuckle.

Mr. McClure followed “Preacherman” with “Hot Summer in Barefoot County,” which was advertised as “hot rods, hot lips and white lightning.” Then came “Truckin’ Man,” a Southern study in “gear jammin', hell fightin’ and tender lovin'.”
