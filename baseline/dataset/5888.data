TRENTON THE first year of the Kean administration, a period marked by economic problems and partisan bickering, has ended. Prospects for continued turmoil in the State House during the coming legislative election year also appear great, for every major bill will be debated with an eye toward its effect on the re-election chances of the 120 members of the Senate and Assembly.

Last year began with calls for bi-partisan cooperation by Governor Kean, who won election by the smallest margin in state history, and by the Democratic leaders in the Senate and Assembly. Mr. Kean, a Republican, was the first incoming Governor in recent history to win election without also pulling in majorities of his own party in both houses of the Legislature.

This proved costly, as problems caused by the ailing national economy escalated routine partisan posturing into confrontation. Before the year ended, Mr. Kean had repeatedly called the legislative leadership ''irresponsible'' for failing to enact new taxes to support state budget needs. At the same time, both the Senate President, Carmen A. Orechio, Democrat of Nutley, and the Assembly Speaker, Alan J. Karcher, Democrat of Sayreville, pictured the Governor as ''timid'' and lacking the leadership to find a solution to the budget crisis.

Relations between the two branches of government were strained during the first six months by the necessity of trimming more than $200 million from spending requests before enacting the current fiscal-year budget of $6.2 billion, a record high.
