BELDOCH-Hannah. She was ''Grandma Honey'' to the five Hochfelder boys and their wives: Jim and Ellen, Tom and Lynda, John and Janet, Andrew and Patricia, Peter and Stacy; and ''Great-Grandma Honey'' to Amy and Scott, Adam and Amy, Lauren, David, Jason, Julie, Josh, Alyssa, Robyn, Jake, Harrison and Charles; and great-great-grandmother to Samantha. After our mother Patricia Beldoch Hochfelder died in 1981, Honey was our surrogate mother, advisor, mentor and best friend to five generations at the same time. Her beautiful legacy will endure forever. The Hochfelder Family
