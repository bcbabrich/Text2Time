Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes – 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Hypothesize how the whales in the picture accompanying the New York Times article “Stranded Whales Dying Despite Rescuers’ Efforts” became beached.

2. Learn about why pilot whales were recently beached at Cape Cod by reading and discussing the article “Stranded Whales Dying Despite Rescuers’ Efforts.”

3. Consider the features of Cape Cod that make it dangerous for the whales; in groups, research dangerous geographical locations; brainstorm newspaper front pages on occurances at these locations.

4. Individually contribute to their groups’ front pages; assemble and display front pages.

Resources / Materials:

-large photograph or transparency of beached whales from the New York Times article that accompanies this lesson

-pens/pencils

-paper

-classroom board

-copies of the article “Stranded Whales Dying Despite Rescuers’ Efforts” (one per student)

-research materials about dangerous places around the world (encyclopedias, geography textbooks, computers with Internet access)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: On an overhead, project the image that accompanies the New York Times article “Stranded Whales Dying Despite Rescuers’ Efforts”. Students respond to the following journal prompt (written on the board prior to class): “How do you think these whales ended up on the beach?” After giving students a few minutes to make their hypotheses, have some students share their ideas with the class. Write hypotheses on the classroom board so that students can later compare their ideas to the explanations in the article.

2. As a class, read and discuss the article “Stranded Whales Dying Despite Rescuers’ Efforts”, focusing on the following questions:

a. What happened at Cape Cod on July 30, 2002? What event followed the next day?

b. What did veterinarians begin to do once they decided that the whales would not make it back to the ocean?

c. What is “the curse” of Cape Cod?

d. What noise informed rescuers that the whales were heading back to sea?

e. What was the beach like where the whales were first beached? What was the second beach like?

f. What bothered David Brand about the rescue effort?

g. What were some of the physical signs that the whales were dying?

3. On the board, write the phrase “The Curse of Cape Cod.” Using the article as a reference, create a list as a class of the geographical features that make Cape Cod a dangerous place for whales. After listing these features, divide the class into groups of three or four, assigning each group another famous geographical location that has a “curse” (meaning that it is difficult to navigate or traverse and poses a danger to humans and/or animals). Locations may include The Bermuda Triangle, the Afghan hills, Siberia, Antarctica, Mount Everest, and Death Valley. Each group researches their assigned location in order to answer the following questions (written on the board for easier student access):

–What are the geographical peculiarities that make this location dangerous? (E.g. terrain, physical shape, climate, location relative to other places)

–What famous event(s) has/have happened there that illustrate(s) these dangers? (The event may focus on the danger posed by the location to either animals or humans, or both.)

Each group then brainstorms a newspaper front page that contains specific information about the dangers of this location, a story about a dangerous event or events that occurred at this location, and pictures of the location itself and the events. Groups should include at least as many articles as there are students in the group, and should also include creative additions to the page, such as an advertisement for a vacation to this location or a timeline of other historic events at this location. Prior to the end of class, groups should divide the work among members, assigning each member a specific task for homework.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: At home, students complete their portions of the newspaper page. In a later class, groups should assemble their pages. Finished newspaper pages can be displayed in the classroom.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–What would you do if you saw a beached whale? WWhat would you do?

–How do you feel about the practice of writing “dead” on the whales?

–Do you think that euthanizing the whales was the right thing to do? What other action do you think could have been taken, and what do you think the results would have been?

–Have you ever had a pet die? How did in make you feel?

–Would you travel to a dangerous place? Why or why not?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on completion of journal, participation in class and group discussions, participation in group research, and completion of newspaper front page.

Vocabulary:

scores, euthanize, peninsula, sonar, marooned, voracious, Samaritans, phalanx, douse, brigade, lesions

Extension Activities:

1. Learn about international laws regarding the hunting and killing of exotic or endangered animals for human consumption. Are some animals forbidden in some countries but permitted in others? When did these laws come into effect? What has been the effect on the animals protected by the laws? Write an article for your school or local paper to heighten community awareness of this issue.

2. Stage a class debate on the topic of animal euthanasia. How is it different from human euthanasia? Do humans have the right to decide when an animal should die? How should this point be determined?

3. Research the various types and sizes of whale populations throughout the world. Create a map charting each population. Also include information on the risks posed to the different populations, such as climate, hunting, and disease.

4. Write a short story entitled “The Curse of Cape Cod” (or another famous location). In your story, focus on how the location itself affects the people and other living things there, leading to disastrous results.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Global Studies- Learn about the ways that different cultures prepare their dead. What rites and rituals are performed? What physical signs are provided to show that a person has passed on? How are bodies buried or otherwise treated? Write a paper about the cultural practices you find most interesting.

Social Studies- The article cites the whales’ “follow the leader” social structure as a reason for the mass beaching at Cape Cod. Create a documentary about adolescent human “follow the leader” social structure and the dangers that can ensue. You might even experiment with making the documentary in the style of a nature film, representing the human subjects as “animals.”

Science- Learn about another species whose behavior sometimes works against its own survival, such as lemmings or salmon. Create a poster illustrating how this behavior works and why this species engages in it.

Technology- Create a Web site featuring the location you researched in the main activity. Include pictures, interactive sections (e.g., “Navigate a plane through the Bermuda Triangle”), and other interesting information.
