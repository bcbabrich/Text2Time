It has been more than a year now since the overdraft scandal hit E. F. Hutton & Company. And for almost a year, the giant New York brokerage firm has been seeking to get out from under a particularly omnious legal cloud.

Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, any company that manages mutual funds is automatically disqualified from the business if it is convicted of a felony. The only exception is if the Securities and Exchange Commission grants the company an exemption. And the S.E.C. can only grant one if the prohibition is ''unduly or disproportionately severe,'' or the applicant's conduct has been such that it is ''not against the public interest to do so.''

In May 1985, Hutton, which manages more than $7 billion in mutual funds, pleaded guilty to 2,000 felony counts of mail and wire fraud. That set off the automatic disqualification as a fund manager. But a appeal to the S.E.C. got Hutton a temporary exemption. And on Thursday, it will come before the S.E.C. again to seek a permanent exemption.

Although commission officials expect the firm to get the exemption, the S.E.C. will consider imposing certain conditions on future conduct, requiring that any Hutton fund have a majority of independent directors or trustees, that Hutton must retain independent counsel for the disinterested directors or trustees and that Hutton have an audit committee made up of disinterested directors or trustees.
