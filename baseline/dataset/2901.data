At the hearing, Judge Nickerson, who has since died, said, ''It would be unrealistic to suppose'' that the defense lawyers who would benefit from a $10 million contract ''would be indifferent to the welfare of the P.B.A.''

In their decision yesterday, the appeals judges said Mr. Worth's divided loyalties became evident with the defense strategy he used at trial. He insisted to the jurors that Justin A. Volpe, the police officer who pleaded guilty to the assault, had acted alone.

Prosecutors have always argued that it was clear that other officers took Mr. Louima to the precinct and that at least one led Mr. Louima to the bathroom where the assault took place and held him down.

In the 68-page ruling, written by Chief Judge John M. Walker Jr., he and Judges Jose A. Cabranes and Chester J. Straub said that Mr. Worth doggedly pursued the assertion that Mr. Volpe had acted alone, a defense that Judge Nickerson later described as ''fanciful.''

Implicating a second officer, the judges said yesterday, would have been a plausible alternative defense strategy, but they said Mr. Worth had a reason for avoiding it. They said implicating a second would have given Mr. Louima ammunition for the claims in his civil suit that there was a conspiracy involving numerous officers and a cover-up.

''Casting Volpe as an aberrant officer who acted alone, on the other hand,'' the judges said, ''would likely have been consistent with any defense advanced in the civil case.''

Mr. Volpe pleaded guilty in the midst of the trial. The decision yesterday said Mr. Volpe's lawyer then told Mr. Worth that Mr. Volpe ''can take your guy out of the bathroom,'' meaning that he could clear Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Volpe's lawyer told Mr. Worth that his client would testify that it was another officer who had taken Mr. Louima to the bathroom. Still, the judges said, Mr. Worth persisted with his assertions to the jury that Mr. Volpe had acted alone, and he did not call Mr. Volpe to the stand.
