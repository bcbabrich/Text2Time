Administrivial Notepad Alert: There will be a Notepad in tomorrow’s puzzle that says “When this puzzle is done, the circles will contain five different letters of the alphabet.

Administrivial Liz Gorski-Specific Announcement: Great news for those of us who love Liz Gorski and her puzzles. Her former blog, Crossword City, has been acquired by Crossword Nation, and Liz will now not only be constructing for them, but will be writing an ongoing blog there about solving and anything else that pops into her very creative mind. Make sure you stop by, bookmark her page and extend a warm welcome to her.

I appreciated the shout-out to The Onion at 35 Down, and couldn’t touch M. C. HAMMER at 58 Across. For those of you who don’t get that, observe:

As much as I can appreciate a good sports clue (yes, I’m just playing along here), I would have much preferred seeing 17 Across (PORTLAND) clued with reference to one of the funnier series I’ve seen in a while, IFC’s Portlandia:
