Sent to Hiroshima

Professor Fujita, who will continue his research at the university, was born in Kitakyushu, Japan. He studied sunspot movements as a teen-ager and remembers his father telling him to get down from the roof during a typhoon.

In 1945, when he was an assistant professor of physics at Meiji College of Technology in Japan, he was sent to Hiroshima and Nagasaki to examine the nature and number of atomic bombs used. ''It was a dangerous game walking around three weeks after the bomb,'' he said.

The experience served him well 30 years later, however, when he was asked to help find the reasons for an Eastern Airlines crash at Kennedy International Airport. He discovered that during a severe storm, violent gusts of air can move straight down, crushing houses and trees and making it impossible for planes to fly. Air, he found, would ''hit the ground very hard'' and spread out, not unlike the shock-wave patterns at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which moved from ground zero outward.

Although this theory of downbursts and microbursts was initially disputed, Professor Fujita installed Doppler radar at three Chicago area airports and was able to document his findings. Now the Federal Aviation Administration is capitalizing on them with the widespread use of Doppler radar, which allows observers to measure the speed of moving objects, including wind.

Tornado Teaching Tool

Tornadoes are Professor Fujita's other passion at Chicago. He devised a widely-used system for measuring their strength, known as the Fujita Tornado Scale, and he has studied and photographed their effects.
