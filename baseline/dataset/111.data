Sanders and Warren had the sharpest messages

The race’s two leading progressives, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, dominated Tuesday night’s debate by defending their uncompromising vision against more moderate ideas. Over and over, as centrist candidates argued that Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren’s policies were impractical, they made their case that Mr. Trump was not the root of America’s ills, and advocated, as Ms. Warren calls it, “big, structural change.”

They were helped by two factors. They had significantly more name recognition — and support in the polls — than the people who were attacking them, including former Representative John Delaney of Maryland and former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado. With them as a foil, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren were able to more easily remain above the fray. However, there is also an ease in defending the progressive vision, because it is aspirational. While other candidates are forced to argue about political possibilities and moderation, the two senators can think bigger and bolder, and ask the audience to do the same.

The hard question for both, which they have avoided on the debate stage to this point, involves how they would pass their policies in a polarized Washington. And many Democrats remain worried that a message of radical change could be perilous in a general election, noting that moderates had a strong track record in the 2018 midterms and that Mr. Obama and President Bill Clinton came from the center of the party.
