Updated, 11:06 a.m. | Even as supporters of congestion pricing prepared to gather at City Hall at 11 a.m. today to cheer the City Council’s vote approving the plan and to urge the State Legislature to approve the $8-a-day traffic fees, opponents of congestion pricing have mobilized as well — at least in their talking points.

City Room received an intriguing e-mail message this morning from Carolyn Daly and Corey B. Bearak of Keep NYC Congestion Tax Free, a group that opposes congestion pricing.

“Despite all of the efforts of the city administration and City Council, the congestion pricing scheme died at midnight last night,” they wrote. “Last year, the State Senate, State Assembly and governor passed into law legislation which set out the creation of the commission to study traffic congestion. It also set the deadline for final action in a clear and unambiguous manner. That legal deadline was March 31, 2008. The language is very clearly and explicit. And it is equally clear that the State Legislature did not approve anything regarding congestion pricing by the stated deadline. The governor did not sign any measure into law by the stated deadline.”

Although a federal memorandum of understanding with the city sets the deadline at April 7 — rather than March 31 — that deadline is “legally only an agreement to agree and does not supersede a law,” Mr. Bearak and Ms. Daly wrote.

Unsurprisingly, supporters of congestion pricing immediately dismissed the argument as specious. After all, if the Legislature set the March 31 deadline in the first place, the Legislature can extend such deadline.

“This is nonsense,” Stu Loeser, the press secretary for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, wrote in an e-mail message in response to questions from The Times. “As we are reminded again and again, a current Legislature cannot bind the hands of a future one. The State Legislature has the same powers to pass congestion pricing today as they did yesterday.”

Gene Russianoff, a staff lawyer at the Straphangers Campaign of the New York Public Interest Research Group, also scoffed at the notion. “April 7 is the real deadline — 90 days since the start of the legislative session, which was the requirement,” he said in a phone interview. “The March 31 deadline, which is part of the law that created the commission, on which I sat, is not a real deadline. The Legislature could just change it. If the Legislature decides to do congestion pricing, the March 31 deadline will not be an obstacle — or an excuse.”
