When Bobby Bowden had something to say, the ears of his players suddenly opened wide. At the end of practice on Thursday, the last day of serious work before his Florida State Seminoles meet the Nebraska Cornhuskers in the 60th Orange Bowl on Saturday night, the head coach of a school still in search of its first national championship made a brief but dramatic change in the routine. Rather than calling upon an assistant to review the schedule for the players, Bowden offered some questions.

"He had a different look about him," said Ken Alexander, the perceptive senior linebacker. "He said, 'Are you really ready? Do you know what it's going to take to play in this game? We need to win this game. Not just for me, not for you. For everybody.' "

That is, for everybody in and around Tallahassee, Fla., whose tastes run to garnet and gold.

For the shivering fans in scarlet back home in Nebraska, and the players who were being born about the time the Huskers won consecutive championships in 1970 and 1971, a different story will be told on New Year's night.

Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne, who was a member of Bob Devaney's staff during those championship seasons, said, "There are a lot of fans in Nebraska who feel I've been a good enough coach, but I haven't really done what they'd like to see me do." One Defining Moment?
