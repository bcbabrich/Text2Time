The Senate plan could also force a highly public intraparty wrangle over how to use the surpluses. But Mr. DiFrancesco and Mrs. Whitman dismissed possible differences today. Mrs. Whitman said the Senate cuts "were initiatives we were going to propose, as well."

Mrs. Whitman has said she wants the tax-cut legislation in place before her budget speech on March 15. Assembly Speaker Garabed Haytaian has promised to deliver the bill by the end of the month from his chamber, and Mr. DiFrancesco pledged today to work as quickly as possible on the Senate bills. The fiscal year ends on June 30. Concern Over Property Taxes

At the heart of the Senate Republicans' decision to lay out a plan for paying for the tax cuts is a growing concern that the proposed cuts, especially for the income tax, would force increases in property taxes and reductions in state aid to municipalities, as well as a political backlash.

By proposing to transfer all $150 million of the Taxpayers' Relief Fund, originally set up to counter Federal gasoline-tax increases, into the Property Tax Relief Fund, the Senate Republicans would have a way to help offset property-tax increases should the proposed tax cut force them to increase.

"We just think it would be speculative if we just proposed cutting taxes today without telling you that we are not going to affect school aid, we are not going to affect municipal aid, we are not going to affect property taxes," Mr. DiFrancesco said. "I don't know if the Governor's office is on board with it. They are aware of it.

"If the administration were to identify other sources that were acceptable to the Legislature, obviously we wouldn't mind. If the administration was to have a whole different scheme of saving money through spending cuts, obviously we wouldn't mind. But we would not want to stand here today and propose that we would eliminate $285 million without telling you that it can be funded through a process in the budget as it exists today. It's up to Governor to determine whether that's the best way or whether they have a better way."

Mrs. Whitman, in Washington for a meeting of the National Governors' Association, said she was delighted with the Senate proposal. "It just means a further commitment that we're going to get this tax cut through," she said.
