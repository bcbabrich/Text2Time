Mike Lowell was bothered by a torn labrum in his left hip, so he had one hit in Boston’s last 11 games. J.D. Drew has been hampered by a strained lower back, so he played in only two of the last 38 games.

But, when the Red Sox opposed the Los Angeles Angels in Game 1 of their division series on Wednesday night, Drew was batting fifth and playing right field and Lowell was batting seventh and playing third base. The playoffs are here and the Red Sox hope the two sidelined regulars are ready.

“I think J.D. had probably his best day in a while yesterday, so that was really good,” said Red Sox Manager Terry Francona. “And, again, there are some off days that help. Mikey Lowell did, I don’t want to speak out of turn, I think he actually did better than we thought.”

Eventhough Drew has been out longer, Lowell’s injury seems to be of more concern to the Red Sox. Francona said Boston’s best team has Lowell at third and Kevin Youkilis at first. He joked that Lowell is “not running the 100 meters in the Olympics” and is “not that fast to begin with.”

If Lowell’s injury prevents him from scoring from second base on a single, Francona said the Red Sox would consider making a change. But Francona stressed that Lowell, who was the Most Valuable Player in the World Series last year, has earned the right to show whether he can contribute.

“This kid has handled so much adversity,” Francona said. “This really hurts. I’m sure it’s painful, what he’s gone through and his willingness to play, he deserves a chance here.”
