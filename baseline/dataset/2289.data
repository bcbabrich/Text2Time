It’s time for President Bush to go to China. I don’t mean that literally, but metaphorically. It’s time for George Bush to do what Richard Nixon did – perform an act whose effectiveness is a function of the fact that he is the last man anyone would have expected to do it. What would that act be? It won’t be – and shouldn’t be – agreeing to a face-to-face, one-on-one debate with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, if only because when you accept the other guy’s invitation you cede him the initiative and the position of leadership, and we all know that George Bush will never willingly do that. No, it has to be something that a) makes clear that he is the one in charge, and b) is so surprising and (apparently) out of character that its very announcement alters the geopolitical landscape and disarms criticism in advance.

President Bush should announce that he’s going to the Middle East for a 7-to-10-day trip and taking along Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and a few congressional leaders from both parties. He should explain that it is not his intention to negotiate anything and certainly not to ask for anything. He should say that he just wants to see firsthand what is going on in a region that is the repository of mankind’s hopes and fears, and so he will visit every country, not only those that are already friendly to the West. He should declare that while he has every faith in U.S. intelligence and considers himself fully informed by the appropriate agencies, there is simply no substitute for being on the ground where you can look the other fellow (or woman) directly in the eye. (He already says that all the time.)

There would be any number of upsides to this venture (or adventure) and almost no downsides. (There would be one big one, but we’ll get to that later.) First there is the political upside. Members of his own party could not demur without giving the Democrats a weapon in the upcoming elections and beyond. (See, even when the president comes up with a good proposal, his party’s regulars will nix it.) Democrats would be obliged to applaud the plan because it is a version of what they have been calling for all along – a turn from military action to diplomacy.

And Democrats would not be able to upstage or imitate the initiative because any unilateral visit from them would be perceived as nothing more than a political sideshow, a grandstanding gesture with no real power behind it to act. Best of all, the Democratic leaders could not decline to participate, for they would then come across as (what they often are) petulant, obstructionist and weak.

Then there is the upside of no possible bad outcome. If the relevant leaders refuse to host the U.S. delegation, the administration still gets both local and international credit for having been willing to go. If the leaders accept, but the trip is so complex an undertaking that it cannot occur before the midterm elections (as would almost certainly be the case), voters will give the administration credit anyway (credit on credit) for having the idea and being ready to act on it. (And besides, whether the trip is stalled, in progress or in the planning stages, all the radio and TV commentators will talk about little else, and names like Abramoff and Katrina will be distant memories.)



If the trip comes off but goes badly – ugly protests at every step; transportation foul-ups; (mild) food poisoning; potentates, princes and presidents refusing to engage in substantive conversation – the president gets to look like a heroic warrior persevering in the face of adverse circumstances. Even if there is no apparent yield, the yield will already have been harvested. And if the trip is a success – crowds come to jeer but end up cheering, endless photo-ops of the president interacting with the common man or woman in the street, real conversations that produce a resolution to meet again or a joint statement declaring mutual respect and a commitment to future cooperation – the president should start writing the speech he will give when he receives the Nobel Peace Prize in Stockholm.

Then there is the historical legacy. Forget about Abu Ghraib, Enron, Halliburton, the Social Security fiasco, the prescription drug fiasco, the deficit fiasco, the Iraq fiasco (the list could be continued indefinitely). President Bush will be remembered as the man who broke the Middle East impasse. The mere act of announcing the trip will be his version of “Tear down that wall, Mr. Gorbechev.” This is an October surprise that could keep on giving for decades and even centuries, and it would be risk-free.

Well, not quite. There is that one downside, and its name is security. Every day hundreds of thousands of people in that part of the world declare that they want to kill George Bush, and here would be the best chance they ever had to do it. Of course the security precautions would be massive. No government, even a government hostile to the United States, would want an assassination or even an attempt at an assassination to occur on its territory. And this would be one time when the hierarchical and despotic political structures about which we always complain would be a good thing: the more absolutist the regime, the more likely that it will be able to identify and control (or perhaps “detain”) persons and groups who are thought to pose a threat of violence. Still, security can never be perfectly tight and the possibility that a lone wing nut (a favorite term of the political right) might get through cannot be discounted. It would then be a matter of doing a cost-benefit analysis, a balancing of the danger and its likelihood against the probability of a very large success.

I’m serious. Despite the occasional tongue-in-cheek tone of the preceding paragraphs, I really think this is a good idea. At the very least it would change the dynamic in the region without asking the president to yield an iota of moral or political authority.

When I was a dean – to compare great things with small – and confronted by a disruptive and obstreperous faculty member or chairperson, I would never call the difficult party into my office. Instead I would telephone and ask him or her if I might drop down and pay a visit. The result often (but not, alas, invariably) was to eliminate defensiveness and improve the chances that something constructive might actually get done; and while I sat there in the uncomfortable straight-backed chair, I was still dean and everyone knew it.

Now being a dean is nothing like being a president, and walking down a few flights of stairs or taking an elevator is nothing like traveling half the world to make your way in hostile territory. But the gesture of going to someone else’s office (or house or parliament or mosque) is a powerful one that has the promise at least of wiping the slate clean and making a new beginning. It might just work. Nothing else has.
