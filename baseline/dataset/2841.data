A New Jersey man was arrested Friday on charges that he sent blueprints for specialized valves to a company's office in New York, knowing that the blueprints would be passed on to North Korea, federal prosecutors said.

The blueprints could be used to produce valves that are critical in the operation of a nuclear plant.

A criminal complaint filed in United States District Court in Manhattan by the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York accused Sitaraman Ravi Mahadevan, 40, of Marlton, N.J., of shipping the blueprints to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in New York. Mitsubishi is one of the contractors involved in the construction of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization's nuclear plant in Yongbyon, North Korea, prosecutors said.

Mr. Mahadevan, an engineer and manager at Valcor Engineering Corporation in Springfield, N.J., was released on $750,000 bail. If convicted he could face a prison sentence of up to 10 years and a fine of up to $250,000.
