Fighting between Government and opposition forces intensified today in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, amid reports that the President, Mohammed Siad Barre, had taken refuge at the international airport.

The position of the President, an ally of the United States, appeared increasingly vulnerable, officials in Washington said. But they said that they had no confirmation that the President was at the airport preparing to flee the country, and that they had no clear idea who had the upper hand in the fighting.

The President has a bunker near the airport and has often used it as part of his routine of rarely staying in one place for any length of time, the officials said.

In the last few days, the fighting had moved to the area of the Presidential residence, known as Villa Somalia, and to the downtown area of the city that fronts onto the Indian Ocean, an official in Washington said. Mortars, machine guns and hand-held rocket launchers were being fired. A Tribal Conflict
