SOUTH ORANGE, N.J., July 31Renee Richards was not overly impressive today, but she did not have to be. She easily won her singles match as play started in the $85,000 Mutual Benefit Life open at the Orange Lawn Tennis Club.

Dr. Richards, a 42‐year‐old transsexual and the center of controversy since she entered the women's field in a tournament here last year, advanced to the second round with a 6‐1, 6‐1 success over 17‐year‐old Donna Lies of Springfield, N.J.

Miss Lies, who ranked 33d in last year's national ratings for girls 16 years and under, was far too nervous to give much opposition to her opponent, an ophthalmologist, from Newport Beach, Calif. Dr. Richards gave Miss Lies a lesson in depth of strokes from the baseline, and delivered sone serves rarely seen on the junior and women's circuit.

But over all, the winner's game was somewhat erratic, especially from the backhand side.

“I was disappointed with my serve,” said Dr. Richards. “Also, I didn't move Donna around. I should have had more versatile game.”
