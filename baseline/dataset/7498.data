The San Diego Chargers, subpar physically for five weeks, have become something less than the awesome defending champions of the American Football League.

A succession of injuries to such key performers as Lance Alworth, Paul Lowe, Ron Mix, Keith Lincoln and Dick Harris has brought the West Coast juggernaut to a standstill. After three league games, the Chargers show a record of one victory and two defeats.

However, unfortunately for the New York Jets, most of the Chargers are expected to be in excellent health when the clubs clash in Shea Stadium Saturday night.

That was the message delivered by Bob Burdick, San Diego's advance man, at the Jets' weekly luncheon yesterday. Of particular interest to Week Ewbank, the Jets' coach, was Burdick's report on Harris, the defensive back who specializes in harassing receivers.
