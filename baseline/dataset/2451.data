Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students design new devices to help victims of natural disaster communicate with rescue workers, government, media and loved ones. For homework, they write proposals promoting their technology.



Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Consider the difficulties of communicating by traditional means during a natural disaster.

2. Learn about the effects of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans media, residents and others by reading and discussing the article “Flooding Stops Presses and Broadcasts, So Journalists Turn to the Web.”

3. Design new technology to maintain communication during disasters.

4. Write proposals describing the new technology and its advantages.

Resources / Materials:

-pencils/pens

-paper

-classroom board

-copies of the article “Flooding Stops Presses and Broadcasts, So Journalists Turn to the Web,” found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050901thursday.html (one per student)

-computers with Internet access

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Students discuss the following prompt (written on the board prior to class) with a partner: “During the past three days, Hurricane Katrina has ravaged New Orleans, leaving 80% of the city under water and residents stranded. If you were trapped in your home during a natural disaster such as a hurricane and needed help, with whom might you need to communicate? Who might need to communicate with you? How would you communicate?”

After a few minutes, allow students to share their ideas and record them on the board. Remind students to consider both their need to inform (rescue workers, loved ones, etc.) and their need to be informed (disaster bulletins, government updates, etc.). What forms of communication technology might and might not continue to function during a natural disaster (land phone, mobile phone, beeper, e-mail, Internet, radio, television, shortwave radio, satellite, etc.)? Of what use would each technology be in such a situation?

2. As a class, read and discuss the article “Flooding Stops Presses and Broadcasts, So Journalists Turn to the Web” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050901thursday.html), focusing on the following questions:

a. Unable to use their offices and presses, to what medium have news outlets in New Orleans turned?

b. What is the daily circulation of the Times-Picayune?

c. What was the one-line headline of the electronic edition on August 30? To what was it referring?

d. To where did the staff of The Times-Picayune evacuate?

e. Which of the four local television stations has been able to keep broadcasting? How?

f. What information did the Web sites of two other stations convey?

g. Where did the fourth station move its operations?

h. What proved more “resilient than traditional media” for New Orleans reporters? Why?

i. What was the state of communications in New Orleans in the aftermath of the hurricane?

j. From where is The Times-Picayune’s Web site run?

k. What role have Web logs, or “blogs,” played in the disaster’s aftermath?

3. Ask the class to imagine that the governor of their state has invited them to prepare a report for a committee on “Disaster-Proof Communication Technology,” whose mission is to facilitate local and statewide communication during and in the aftermath of a natural disaster.

Explain to students that they will work in three to five small groups (depending on class size) to design new technology to enable residents to communicate with rescue agencies, state government, the media, and family when the power is out and traditional means of communication no longer function. Encourage students to draw on their own experiences with cutting-edge technology (i.e. computer hardware and software, MP3 players, pocket organizers, video games, etc.) and conclusions drawn from the article and the warm-up discussion, while brainstorming the look and function of their device.

Each small group will work together to develop designs for the device’s hardware and software and possible uses for the technology, writing a one-page outline proposal guided by the questions below. The purpose of the exercise is to stimulate both students’ thinking about how need can drive technological innovation and their creativity in conceiving ways to fulfill that need. It may help students to review The New York Times special section on Hurricane Katrina (//www.nytimes.com/pages/national/nationalspecial/index.html) for background on its effects on New Orleans.

Groups should be guided in their development of a technology design by the following categories and questions (copied into a handout for easier student access):

HARDWARE DESIGN

-What is the device’s primary purpose and function? What is it called?

-How and with what (other devices, radio signals, etc.) or whom can it communicate? Why is it particularly useful in a natural disaster?

-What does it look like? What is its size and shape?

-What forces or elements can it withstand?

-Will it have the ability to record and/or play audio? Can it be used to signal with light, sound, etc.?

-How does it run? How can it function in a natural disaster?

-What buttons or other controls does it have? For what purpose?



SOFTWARE DESIGN

-What type of operating system (computer, Web browser, digital camera, etc.) does it utilize?

-What does the user interface look like? What is the basic “look and feel”?

-What information can the user input (location, physical description, contact information, health records, special needs, etc.)?

-What information can the user receive (audio or video news bulletins, Web pages, instructions, directions, message receipt acknowledgement, real-time communication, etc.)?

-Where and how is information sent and received?



USES

-For whom is the device primarily designed (individuals, families, organizations, media, government officials, rescuers, etc.)?

-How can it serve groups with special needs, such as the elderly, the ill and/or disabled, youth, pets, those with certified disaster training, etc.?

-When will the device be used? Only during large-scale disasters? When else might it be useful?

Remind all students to take notes on their group’s design to use for the homework assignment. Provide time at the end of class for each group to briefly present their ideas to the rest of the class. Encourage students to pay close attention to their classmates’ proposals. If time allows, discuss differences and similarities among the proposals. Ask students: What have you learned about the process of developing new technology?

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: For homework, students individually prepare formal proposals based on their outlines, editing them as they see fit. If time allows, groups may reunite in a future class to prepare a final set of proposals, which can be bound together and submitted to a local or state authority and relevant local disaster-related agencies and organizations.

Further Questions for Discussion:

-Who are The Times-Picayune and New Orleans television affiliates reaching through the Web? Who are they not reaching? How might news media prepare for natural disaster?

-Do you access news media online? How much of the media that you read is online? Do you think that the Web will play a more central role in media in the future? Why or why not?

-Do you read your local newspaper? During a natural disaster, what kind of information would you expect from it? Why? Does it have a plan for such a disaster? If so, what is it?

-How might the technology developed in class be used to help residents of other areas with high risks of natural disaster?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on participation in the initial task and subsequent class discussion, contribution to the design project, and thoughtful completion of the written assignment.

Vocabulary:

outlets, abandoned, circulation, catastrophic, evacuating, bayou, affiliate, interim, resilient, oversees, ingenuity, magnets, impacted, assault

Extension Activities:

1. Develop a series of print, radio, television and/or Web advertisements to promote the technology you designed in class.

2. Write your own blog in which you express your perspective on an ongoing current events story such as steroids and sports, the war in Iraq, or a local story.

3. Create a “How It Works” poster that explains how levees worked and failed when confronted with Hurricane Katrina.

4. What causes electricity and telephone wires to stop functioning? Interview an electrician and do Internet research, then write an article and submit it for publication to your school and/or community newspaper.

5. The article likens an e-mail message sent by a Times-Picayune editor to “a wartime cable message.” Research the cable communications technology to which the writers are referring and write an essay about whether you think cable communications are obsolete or still useful today.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Civics – Write a report on the roles of local, state and national government in a natural disaster. Describe the roles played by all three in New Orleans and interview officials in your own city and state government to determine what their responses would be were a natural disaster to strike your state and how they would work together. Consider the following areas of responsibility: preparedness, rescue effort, temporary housing, assessment of damages, maintenance of public order, disbursement of relief aid, and clean-up and repair.

Geography – Label a blank map of the world to show what hurricanes have affected which parts of the world in the last two decades. How much damage (human and economic) did they cause?

Health – Read The New York Times article “Disease and Coordination Vie as Major Challenges” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/students/pop/articles/31health.html) and visit the official Web site of FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) (//www.fema.gov/), then create an informational pamphlet on the physical and mental health risks and remedies presented by a hurricane and its aftermath.

Media Studies – Visit your local library and browse the Web sites mentioned in the article to compare coverage of New Orleans news before and after the Hurricane Katrina disaster. Write an essay that responds to the following question: How does the role and function of the media change during a time of disaster?

Science – Construct a three-dimensional model to show how Hurricane Katrina caused flooding in New Orleans. Use the model as a visual aid and deliver an oral presentation on the topic to your class. The three New York Times maps showing “The Impact of Hurricane Katrina” (https://static01.nyt.com/packages/html/national/2005_HURRICANEKATRINA_GRAPHIC/index.html) and the slide show of photographs and video called “Hurricane Katrina: The Storm’s Impact” (https://static01.nyt.com/packages/khtml/2005/08/30/national/20050830_STORM3_FEATURE.html) may be helpful.

Teaching with The Times – Read The Times’ coverage of Hurricane Katrina for the next month, clipping articles that relate to technology. What technology played a major role during and after the disaster? How will the crisis influence hurricane watch networks (if at all)? Did technology have a negative affect on residents who stayed in New Orleans? If so, how? Write a creative essay on the disaster that focuses on the uses (or uselessness) of technology.
