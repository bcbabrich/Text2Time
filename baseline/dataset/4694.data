Bobby Fischer tried the same type of quiet positional play yesterday in Game 27 that he had used to defeat Boris Spassky in Game 9, but this time it got him nothing. The players agreed to a draw after 46 moves of uneventful, though stubborn, maneuvering.

Fischer has nine victories in their Belgrade match, and will be awarded the winner's $3.35 million prize if he can add one more to his score. Spassky has won five, and seems headed for the loser's share, $1.65 million. Nevertheless, he seems determined not to be a pushover.

Fischer made a slight alteration from his known strategy in this game, and may have expected to harvest more from it. Spassky's defense, however, was impeccable. In fact, it worked so well that he could reasonably entertain some small hopes of fabricating a victory out of it. But Fischer played carefully, holding his opponent at bay, and neither player could significantly disturb the game's balance. A Healing Rest?

It is possible that Fischer was not averse to taking such a draw after having been squashed in the previous game. Licking one's wounds is considered an important part of chess generalship. Spassky would have done more, if he could have.
