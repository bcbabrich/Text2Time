Speaking of age, DENG XIAOPING, the senior leader in China, who has been reported to be seriously ill, had something to say this week about his longevity. According to The Associated Press, the 89-year-old leader told The Press Digest newspaper in Beijing that he attributes his long life to cold showers and the game of bridge, which he plays avidly.

"I haven't had a single cold in the past 10 years," he told the newspaper. "One of the reasons I'm in such good health is that I take a cold shower every morning." He said the showers augment the body's ability to withstand cold. NADINE BROZAN
