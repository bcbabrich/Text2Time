IT was midsummer, but standing on the seventh tee, I felt a blustery wind blowing hard in my face. The green, 175 yards away, was framed by dunes covered in golden fescue and protected by natural-looking sand traps pockmarked with stones and tufts of grass. Stretching from the craggy beach to the eastern horizon was a vast body of water. A brief rain squall broke out as the sun struggled to poke through the clouds.

I could almost imagine I was on the coast of Ireland.

But this was Wisconsin, along the shore of Lake Michigan. And the course was no classic seaside links over sheep-grazed meadows, but rather the two-year-old Straits Course at Whistling Straits, built from scratch by Pete Dye, the devilish golf course architect, on the site of an abandoned military firing range.

Now, I've never been to Ireland. But Herbert V. Kohler Jr., the chairman and president of the Kohler Company and the force behind the nearby American Club resort in the town of Kohler, has. So when he decided that he wanted the Platonic ideal of a Irish seaside course, modeled on the great Ballybunion -- and opened the corporate coffers to pay for it -- that is exactly what he got. Including sheep.

The same relentless pursuit of perfection was carried over to the resort, where my wife, Lisa, and I spent a few days of our vacation. Just about everything at the Kohler complex is perfect, almost too perfect.
