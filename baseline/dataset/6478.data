TORONTO, Dec. 1 (UPI)— William M. Kunstler, the Amer ican civil rights lawyer who was a defense attorney for the Chicago seven, was acquitted today of assaulting two leaders of a right‐wing group.

The prosecution recommended the acquittal, saying there was not enough evidence to support the charges that Mr. Kunstler struck the two in a fight be tween leftists and rightists at tending a Kunstler speech last June 22.

“It'll ruin my image as a bat tler,” Mr. Kunstler said after the verdict. “But the truth had to come out.”

Marshall Margolis, a Toronto lawyer, and James Renwick, member of Parliament, testified for the defense that Mr. Kunstler had not struck or tried to strike anyone.
