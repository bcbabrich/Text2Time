To the Editor:

Re ''What Happened to the Asian Century?'' (Op-Ed, Dec. 29):

Ian Buruma writes that increased growth awaits those Asian nations that give their citizens more freedom.

But the opposite has been true for the last two decades, and the medium-term prospect is for more of the same. Highly coveted foreign investment for labor-intensive industries will continue to flow to the most repressive and corrupt countries (with the exception of Myanmar).

Most realists do not find it ''hard to imagine'' that China's economy can keep on growing without granting significant new freedoms to the Chinese people.
