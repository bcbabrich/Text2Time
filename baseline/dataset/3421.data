Now Mr. Mahathir's favorite hobbyhorse -- controlling capitalism's excesses, keeping small countries from being washed out to sea by the ebb and flow of billions of dollars -- is the subtext of half the seminars here in Davos.

While almost no one has endorsed the Malaysian solution, declaring a nation's currency valueless outside its borders, the 73-year-old Prime Minister has come to seek vindication, and to delight in the fact that the International Monetary Fund and the United States Treasury fear others could follow Mr. Mahathir's path.

''The U.S. must be more tolerant of the stupidity of Malaysia,'' he said. ''Why not leave us to do the wrong things we want to do? What is this talk about freedom and independence if you say I have the power to stop you and I will stop you?''

Actually, the United States has not exactly said that. But Mr. Mahathir was directly challenged on his own turf in November by Vice President Al Gore, who at an Asian economic summit meeting in Kuala Lumpur took up the language of Mr. Anwar and other enemies of Mr. Mahathir's rule, openly calling for ''reformasi,'' or reform.

Mr. Gore's aides are happy that it played well back home, that the Vice President, in the words of one of his advisers, ''took on a tin-pot dictator.''

Here in Davos, Mr. Mahathir and Mr. Gore steered clear of each other, no small trick in a town this small. But Mr. Mahathir spent a good deal of time repairing relations with investors, who have cut his country off ever since Malaysia declared that any money invested in the country must stay there for at least one year.

Asked over dinner about statements he made to largely Muslim audiences in Malaysia about the role of Jews in causing the global financial crisis, he readily admitted that his people ''see a Jewish hand'' in the chaos, and he did not appear prepared to challenge that perception.
