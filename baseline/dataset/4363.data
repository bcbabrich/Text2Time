It's no big deal, she said. Her rise, undoubtedly heightened by a shallow woman's draw depleted of stars, has given her a unique place in Japanese sports, endorsements having paid so well that Date is set for life and her father, a former subway conductor, has been able to retire.

Date doesn't see herself creating a Japanese ground swell for tennis by becoming that country's first player, man or woman, to crack the top 10. Her ambitions, by American standards, are modest. With her 24th birthday later this month, in her sixth year on the tour, she said she merely wants to achieve "realistic goals."

It could be that old habits are difficult to break. Date was introduced to the sport by her parents in Kyoto when she was 6. A natural left-hander, she was informed that since the overwhelming majority of Japanese played tennis right-handed, it might be viewed as culturally incorrect for her to play southpaw. Though she continues to write and eat with her left hand, she switched to a right-handed game, forever more.

Date did have to rebel after convincing herself that she was good enough to play the pro circuit. After she graduated from high school, her parents wanted her to go to college. She thought she was ready to see Europe, North America, the world beyond Asia.

"I just told them I was going," she said.

Her ranking has risen steadily since 1989, and she has beaten, along the way, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, Gabriela Sabatini and Mary Joe Fernandez. At the Open, Date hopes she can repeat the quarterfinal run she made here a year ago, when she took out Anke Huber and Jana Novotna along the way to being eliminated by Manuela Maleeva-Fragniere.
