They were drawn across the Atlantic by curiosity about another culture or dedication to their professions. Some were retirees savoring their freedom, or grandparents relishing their grandchildren. Others were students, exploring another part of the world. Some were businessmen. Some were crew members, for whom the flight between America and Egypt was business.

Yesterday morning, all 217 passengers and crew members on Egyptair Flight 990 were apparently plunged into the sea off Nantucket. Though united in death, they were diverse in life.

Four of the passengers were Egyptian students, ages 12 to 19, who had been in Baltimore for a two-week exchange program between Luxor, their hometown, and Baltimore, its sister city, said Abdel Wahab Elabd, the chairman of the Baltimore-Luxor-Alexandria Sister City Committee. A fifth passenger was the father of one of the students; he was a chaperon on the trip.

''They were very bright kids, very charming, all of them,'' Mr. Elabd said. ''They had a great time here.''
