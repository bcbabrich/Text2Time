There are indications that Tyrone Wheatley, the Giants' first-round draft pick, has agreed in principle to a multiyear contract and could report to camp as early as Wednesday. That's the good news regarding the Giants' top two picks. The bad news is that offensive tackle Scott Gragg will miss four to six weeks with a broken right foot.

On Sunday night Wheatley left Detroit, where he has been staying with his grandmother and aunt, and is now in the New York area. It is the first time in weeks that Wheatley has come to New York.

The Giants and Wheatley's agent, Joel Segal, have apparently worked out the nagging issues that had slowed negotiations. Those issues mainly concerned salary and bonus money. One package the two sides are talking about is a five-year deal worth about $5 million. But that deal is just one of several options that have been discussed.

Segal has said for weeks that a deal was close, but now some people familiar with the situation say the two sides are extremely close. The Giants' last offer was similar to the five-year, $4.925 million deal signed by Napoleon Kaufman of the Raiders. He was chosen one pick behind Wheatley at No. 18.
