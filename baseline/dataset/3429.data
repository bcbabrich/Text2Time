The Aruba Tourism Authority, in an unusual reversal of the outcome of a review, has decided to return its account to Fitzgerald & Company in Atlanta after dismissing the agency two weeks ago to hire the Martin Agency in Richmond.

Fitzgerald, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, had handled the Aruba account, with billings estimated at $7 million to $10 million, from April 1996 until the review concluded on Feb. 12 with the selection of Martin, also owned by Interpublic. In a statement on Friday, Jan Van Nes, director of the tourism authority in Oranjestad, Aruba, praised Fitzgerald for its ''presentation and initial attention'' to the account.

But, he added, ''we believe that the right decision for the future of Aruba is to resume our successful relationship with Fitzgerald.'' David P. Fitzgerald, president and chief executive at Fitzgerald, said the agency was ''delighted'' with the reinstatement.

At Martin, Kerry Feuerman, vice chairman, said his agency was ''surprised'' that the review results were being reversed because ''based on the incredibly enthusiastic response we got to our presentation, we thought we were going to have a great relationship.''
