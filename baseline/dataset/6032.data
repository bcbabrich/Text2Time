LOS ANGELES, May 1—'California's chief legal officer renewed a dispute last week over the constitutionality of three state laws that are hampering the development of atomic power. In a formalWASHINGTON,May 1 (AP) — The House Government Operations Committee recommended in a report released today that further Federal licensing of nuclear power plants be suspended until legal opinion, Attorney General Evelle Younger asserted that three statutes, enacted in 1976, transgressed both the Federal and state Constitutions.

His ruling, however, was not expected to have any immediate effect on the virtual moratorium on new nuclear plants in the nation's most populous state. But it seemed likely to have repercussions in the current California political campaign, and may stimulate litigation.

The laws in question bar any new nuclear plants until the Federal Government develops a national nuclear‐fuel reprocessing system and a permanent disposal system for radioactive waste. The disposal system is generally believed to be 10 to 15 years away.

A third law provided for a feasibility study of underground atomic plants. Similar constraints are under consideration in New York and several other states.
