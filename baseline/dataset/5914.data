This has not been one of the great weeks in Bayreuth history. The combination of nearly unbearable heat and the new ''English'' production of the ''Ring of the Nibelungs'' that never seemed to know where it was headed or why made for long, stifling evenings in the Festspielhaus that Wagner built to house his music dramas.

However, even inferior performances of the ''Ring'' must end. With the premiere Saturday night of ''Gotterdammerung,'' the new cycle of four works that the Bayreuth Festival mounted to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Wagner's death finally struggled to a close.

The production, which was entrusted to the all-British team of Sir Georg Solti, Sir Peter Hall and William Dudley as conductor, director and designer, respectively, proved to be acceptable musically, if uneven and flawed.

But the director and his designer earned the fiercest and most sustained jeering that I have ever heard in a theater. Even when they joined the entire company on stage for a massed bow, the audience would not allow them to hide. The whole stage full of people was booed until the pair responsible for the staging appeared in tandem to take their medicine.
