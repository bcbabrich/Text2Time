Don Meade, the stormy petrel of the American turf in the days when he was the nation's jockey champion, said yesterday that his 18year ban from racing had been lifted and that he intended to apply Monday for a license to be a trainer in New York State.

The 50‐year‐old former rider said he had been notified by officials in Mexico that the lifetime suspension he received there in 1945 for using profane language to track stewards was lifted on July 19.

Except for five days in 1950 when the state of Florida gave him a probationary license that he later returned, the Mexican suspension has kept Meade out of racing in the United States because United States and Mexican racing bodies abide by each other's rulings.

Once Meade said that he would begin a comeback, if he could win reinstatement, by returning to the saddle in Mexico. But today he said that his age was against that.
