''Obviously, we're pretty slow,'' Dane Fife, Indiana's senior guard, said, laughing. ''It's pretty clear we can't get up and down the floor like some teams. But our style of play goes back to the basic fundamentals of basketball. Boxing out, cutting, beating people off the dribble, using our big guys as passers -- those are all pure elements of basketball.''

Thus far, those are among the elements Indiana has executed with beauty.

''To set the pace and the tone of the game, we figure out a game plan and try to execute it,'' said Jarrad Odle, a senior forward. ''On missed shots we try to run our break, but on made shots we like to slow it down and run an offensive set. If we use up the shot clock and take good shots, that slows it down and makes it a 60- or 70-point game. We've got the scorers to go to an 80- or 90-point game, but we really do play a lot better when it's a lower-scoring game.

''We always look for the best shot, and on defense we try to make the other team use almost all of their shot clock. When we do that, that's two 35-second possessions per team. That's more than a minute for two possessions, and over the course of the game that impacts the entire game.''

Much of managing a game starts for Indiana on defensive transition.

All five of its players on the floor are taught to get back on defense and find a spot to defend the lane. The dribbler must be stopped at the perimeter and not allowed into the interior. Do not let opponents freelance on offense; force them to create an offensive set.

Dribble penetration and layups drive Indiana Coach Mike Davis into a tizzy.

''Playing your pace and your style maintains an offensive flow,'' Davis said. ''You want the other team to spread and make passes and then take bad shots. If you don't have control of the tempo, you are asking to lose. Our kids know that if we lose, we want to lose doing what we do best and not getting caught up into the other team's style.''
