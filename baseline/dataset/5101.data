''We're very glad to see George Washington in such good form,'' said Mitsuko Suzuki of Japan, who traveled to New York City with four members of her family for the festivities. Closing the Cycle

Yesterday's ceremony capped a series of observances of the nation's founding that included the celebration of American independence, in 1976, and the 1987 salute to the Constitution. And the inaugural re-enactment came after a weekend of festivities that brought a flotilla of tall ships into New York Harbor and sent fireworks flashing over lower Manhattan on Saturday. In the foggy night sky, the fireworks had a washed-out look, but the crowd oohed and aahed as rosettes bloomed above New York harbor and cannon-like booms echoed back and forth.

After the first inauguration 200 years ago, Dr. W. W. Buchanan, a godson of Washington, wrote that there was ''a police office and watch-house'' at Broad and Wall Streets, and he watched the inauguration from there. That station house is long gone, but the police were on hand yesterday. More than 4,500 officers were stationed throughout lower Manhattan, and most of the area was sealed off to private cars for most of the weekend.

Yesterday's events began where Washington began his day 200 years ago, at St. Paul's Chapel, between Fulton and Vesey Streets. Two hundred years ago, its steeple made it one of the tallest buildings in Manhattan; now it is dwarfed by the World Trade Center and almost everything else nearby. But inside the sanctuary, with its clear glass windows and covered altar, the pew that George Washington used on his inauguration day is still there.

For yesterday's ''Service of Thanksgiving,'' the church was filled with more than 300 dignitaries, including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat of New York. He arrived as the deep, ancient bells in the church tower tolled. A Hymn Is Reprised

Mayor Edward I. Koch was already inside, as were Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a fellow Democrat; Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a New York Republican; Senator Frank Lautenberg, a New Jersey Democrat, and the actress Helen Hayes.

Mr. Bush's heavily-guarded motorcade glided to a stop under a tent outside the chapel and the President and Mrs. Bush went inside, where bright television lights and video cameras were nestled between the chapel's ornate white columns. There was no sermon, only readings and prayers, including one by the Right Rev. Paul Moore Jr., the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York. Mr. Moore greeted the Bushes and noted that he had once worked on a ''civil rights program in Texas'' with them.
