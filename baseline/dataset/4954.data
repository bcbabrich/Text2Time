LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton, the French liquor and luxury-products company, moved to increase its stake in Guinness P.L.C. to 24 percent, in line with the British liquor company's stake in LVMH. LVMH said the move was part of an agreement reached with Guinness in 1988 to hold equal stakes in each other. Guinness said it welcomed the move.

LVMH is raising its Guinness stake by offering to pay as much as $13.86 a share for up to 59.4 million Guinness shares. The French company's holdings include 42.8 million shares acquired today. These purchases plus the tender offer will cost a total of about $1.4 billion, LVMH said.
