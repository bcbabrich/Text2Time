Even in New York, it's hard to find haute couture, old Yahtzee games, rubber boots and captive plastic honey bears all in one space. Not to mention a place where all of it, except for the honey bear, is free.

But past the shiny boutiques of Bedford Avenue, down Grand Street toward the water, is a storefront with a hand-painted sign reading, ''Free Store.'' It is crammed with crockery, clothes, lamps and tools, and you are welcome to walk out with anything you like.

''Anything that's not chained down,'' explained Jessica Baldwin, the store's owner, if that's the right word. Six months ago, she turned the 350-square-foot area into a merchandise repository and lounging area, complete with coffee maker, boom box and guitar (all chained down). Like a giant clam, it filters the sea of excess items that flow in and out of a neighborhood.

It started as a temporary project. ''People were calling it a performance store,'' Ms. Baldwin said, adding that it was based on similar stores from the 1970's. She is no retrograde, (''I wouldn't compare myself to hippies or call myself a hippie. It's 2002.''), but her store, open for anyone to hang out and play music, shares that 70's public-good ethos. Nowadays, ''there are fewer and fewer benches and pay phones,'' she said. ''Just less common space for people.''
