Although the eyes of Irving, Texas, and a national television audience will be on Joe Namath when the Jets play Dallas Saturday, the eyes of the Jet defense will be on Roger Staubach and their legs will be trying to keep up with him.

Staubach is ‘the daring quarterback of the Cowboys and right now he is in a singular position—he's one of the best running quarterbacks in the National Football League and he's the leading passer in the National Conference.

Little wonder he presents problems for the defensive people.

“No one's been able to stop him,” Buddy Ryan, the Jets’ defensive line coach, said yesterday. “He's a different type of scrambler than Fran Tarkenton. Tarkenton is smart. He lays down before you get him. This guy keeps going. He thinks he's a running back. He's still trying to win the Heisman Trophy, in the pros.”

Staubach won the Heisman eight years ago, as a junior at Navy. Four years of naval service, including a year in Vietnam, delayed his pro career, but now, in his third year as a Cowboy, he's reaching the potential he showed as a collegiate star.
