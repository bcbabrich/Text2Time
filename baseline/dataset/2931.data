American and Australian troops killed four suspected Taliban or Al Qaeda fighters along the Afghan frontier in the past two days, military officials said today, as hundreds of allied troops under United States command swept the border area near Pakistan.

Military officials said that a force of fewer than 1,000 allied fighters had been working in and out of the border area for more than a week and that they had found large caches of weapons, but few adversaries, despite the recent firefights.

The allied fighters include Afghans, American Special Forces, troops from the 101st Airborne Division, and Australian and British special operations forces and Royal Marines.

A Pakistani intelligence official said a major American-led military operation would probably begin in the area around Khost in the next 24 hours. Pakistan, the official said, had already been alerted to seal its border along Afghanistan's Paktia Province. An American communications and intelligence center had been set up in the tribal area on the Pakistani side to help coordinate the operation, the official said.
