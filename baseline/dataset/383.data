They maintain a subscription to the concert series at the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion near Houston, where their seats are in the sixth row center. Most frequently these days they see Dave Matthews, whose own spontaneity renders everyone else loose as well. “He never plays the same show twice,” Mr. Barker said.

Fans of jazz, jam bands and certain dance or electronic music will recognize themselves in this, too. Dr. Brown described this to me as “giving yourself over” to the experience. The anything-can-happen vibe will be familiar to people who hunt, fish, go bird watching, play music or paint, and also to anyone who has ever shown up in a restaurant and asked the staff to bring out whatever they are most excited about that day.

Money eventually does enter the play conversation, as it must. But Mr. Boudreaux often uses his play conversations to talk people out of spending. Second homes are a big topic of conversation. He worries about people who pay to keep an inherited second home without stopping to think about whether going there meets their children’s (or their own) definitions of play. Is it voluntary, for starters? Do they lose track of time or worry themselves sick over the to-do list?

Similarly, plenty of people stretch to be the first in their families to buy a lake home or hunting cabin without reckoning with the burdens of maintaining it — or whether their children will be too busy with sports, camp or summer jobs to ever go there.

Ms. Brown, whose family is comfortable financially, found herself spending less once she reckoned with Dr. Brown’s definitions of play. Dr. Brown finds himself playing storyteller for his grandchildren as he ages and the tricky double black diamond ski runs in Colorado become more of an effort. (He still enjoys his daily hikes by a river with his dog.)

The Barkers actually make money on their concert ticket subscription, since they do not go to most shows and resell their excellent seats on the secondary market. That said, Don did plow the profits into pricey seats for a coming Adele show as part of a Christmas present for Louise.

As for Mr. Boudreaux, who said that he found many of the elements of fun in his work, too, he tries to lead by example. His family of four is in a condo, not a grand home on St. Charles Avenue or elsewhere in the finer precincts of New Orleans. But the condo does allow them to have access to a pool, which meets the definition of play for him, his wife and their older daughter. (Their son is a baby.)
