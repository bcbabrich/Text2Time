In something of a microcosm of ABC's fortunes this television season, the comeback of ''Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' last week started strong in the ratings but faded as the competition stiffened.

The game show, now called ''Super Millionaire'' to reflect the $10 million jackpot, still performed better than almost everything else on ABC's schedule. It was the highest-rated program on the network each of the five nights it was on last week, although none of the shows matched Sunday's promising performance, when it was the highest-rated show on any network.

The show averaged more than 13 million viewers a night, a strong showing that would place it about 21st among all shows this season. But its viewership among the 18-to-49-year-olds that ABC most cares about -- the group advertisers want to reach the most -- was more modest. ''Super Millionaire'' attracted about 5.3 million viewers in that age range, (good for about 37th overall this season). Still, the show was some good news for ABC, which is mired in fourth place among the four major networks and a drag on the earnings of its parent, the Walt Disney Company. It improved on all the shows it replaced on ABC's regular schedule and on the ratings on the shows that preceded it, as well as performing surprisingly well among younger men from 18 to 34. Last Thursday, the network ordered another week's worth of the shows in May.

As the show's executive producer, Michael Davies, put it, ''The ratings were solid, not spectacular, solid.'' But he added, ''I'm sure in their wildest dreams ABC wanted 'Millionaire' to be the show that could put the network on its back and carry it. It's not that.''
