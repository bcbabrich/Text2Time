Sanchez may be asked to become the team's second baseman if Roberto Alomar is traded before the July 31 deadline, as is widely expected. In the meantime, Sanchez said he would be happy to tutor Reyes.

''I'm up for that,'' said Sanchez. ''I've had so many guys do that for me. I can do it, too.''

Reyes is hitting .205, and just .158 left-handed, and he has made six errors in 20 games since being called up. But since his promotion from Class AAA Norfolk on June 10, he has shown he is ready to play for the Mets.

Steve Phillips, then the Mets' general manager, had said when Reyes was promoted that he would be with the team only until Sanchez was ready to return, then he would be sent back to Norfolk. Phillips was fired two days later.

With the Mets tumbling further and further out of contention, Duquette and Howe agreed that Reyes could learn more by staying with the team, even if he continued to make mistakes. What do the Mets have to lose?

''If we were fighting for a pennant right now, maybe we'd look at it a little differently, but we're not,'' Howe said.

Mets management had been concerned that Reyes might be overmatched against big-league pitching. He has struck out 12 times in 73 at-bats, but he has also driven in 15 runs and hit a home run.

''He doesn't show signs of being concerned or upset, and he plays hard every inning he's out there,'' Howe said of Reyes.
