It was Governor Carey who decided to house prisoners in empty buildings of the Long Island psychiatric hospital. Protesting neighbors organized an articulate, determined pressure group.

In the 1982 campaign, all the gubernatorial candidates, including Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Koch, promised to close the Pilgrim prison. Mayor Koch later changed his mind, concluding that a public that demands crime control has to accept more jails and prisons. But Mr. Cuomo stuck to his promise.

The Pilgrim prison has operated since 1982 without posing any threat to the community. Objections to it are irrational. The fact that its prisoners can be accommodated elsewhere hardly justifies its abandonment. The new prison construction will only make a potentially catastrophic situation barely tolerable.

Closing Pilgrim offers powerful encouragement to the mindless ''not-in-my-neighborhood'' sentiment that hopelessly complicates the siting of many necessary projects - sewage-treatment plants, shelters for the homeless, homes for the retarded, drug rehabilitation centers.
