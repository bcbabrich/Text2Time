President Bush met with Prime Minister Li Peng of China today for the first time since Mr. Li presided over Beijing's crackdown on democracy campaigners in 1989.

Mr. Bush went ahead with the chilly, 20-minute encounter despite critics' charges that even a brief meeting would buttress the international standing of the Chinese Government and Mr. Li. The President contends that such contacts are worthwhile as a means of tempering Beijing's behavior through dialogue. Hundreds of people protested against the meeting outside.

The meeting took place in a conference room here after both leaders attended the summit meeting of leaders of nations represented on the Security Council.

Barely an hour before they met, the State Department issued its annual worldwide human rights report, in which China was accused of an array of abuses and described as a repressive regime "falling far short of internationally accepted norms." [ Page 6. ]
