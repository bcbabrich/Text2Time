To the Editor:

The anecdote from "McNamara's Old Bronx" about the pianist Ignace Jan Paderewski dropping in impulsively on a Bronx piano teacher (after hearing a Chopin nocturne emitting from an open window), and giving the astonished woman an impromptu free lesson (F.Y.I., April 24), reminds me of a similar event many years ago:

Mischa Elman, the legendary violinist, was notorious for visiting, unannounced, Manhattan stringed-instrument dealers and repair shops. One afternoon in Rembert Wurlitzer's 42nd Street store, I was trying out a violin to borrow for an audition. No sooner had I begun the Glazounov concerto, when Elman popped in.

I froze, but he gestured to keep playing. Suddenly he cried, "No, no," grabbed the fiddle from me, and played the entire first movement.

It was a somewhat one-sided lesson, since I didn't get to play another note.

But I could not resist telling my fellow Juilliard students that I had a lesson with Elman.
