For the most part those babies were either abandoned in hospitals at birth, born with drugs in their systems or brought to the hospitals suffering from neglect or abuse.

The study found 58 of the children, about 60 percent, were still in foster care in 1988, many because the paper work had not been done on time. Both the city and the private agencies who place children under contract were found to be at fault. 'Results Are Shocking'

The 73-page report said that in 46 percent of the cases, the agencies had failed to file a petition to end parental rights on time. In another 46 percent, the city failed to respond on time to requests to put children up for adoption or to place them elsewhere.

''The results are shocking,'' Mr. Goldin said. ''These children have been shuffled from one temporary home to another. Morever, indifference has been compounded by bad judgment.''

For example, the report said, the city waited seven months to respond to an adoption request, then denied the request because it was more than six months old. The child in that case, who came into foster care after being neglected, remains with foster parents who have said they will not adopt him.

By law the city must respond to adoption requests within 30 days.

The report said the city also failed to abide by the 30-day limit in a case involving a child who had not seen her mother in 22 months and who was listed as expected to ''return to parent.'' Although a request to put the child up for adoption was made in August 1987, the city had not responded after nine months. Deprived of Adoption

In another case, a child who was never visited by either parent was still not freed for adoption after almost three years, the report said. Had proper procedure been followed, the child could have been adopted shortly after his first birthday. Instead, the report said, ''adoption is still in the remote future.'' The 30-Day Limit
