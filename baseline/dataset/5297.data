To the Editor:

Two points about ''Why the Rush on Nuclear Waste?'' by Dan W. Reicher and Caroline Petti (Op-Ed, July 13) need emphasis: (1) it is mostly opinion, and (2) it is mostly inaccurate.

The proposed waste isolation pilot plant, sitedc 26 miles east of Carlsbad, N.M., was authorized in 1979 for storage of ''transuranic'' waste - the everyday items (rags, rubber gloves, lab coats, etc.) that become contaminated during routine operation of our nuclear defense facilities. It is being constructed in a salt formation, a site chosen after a national search. It has had its critics, as do most things nuclear.

Any balanced discussion of the project should not ignore the following:

* The Department of Energy is not seeking any waiver of Environmental Protection Agency standards for waste disposal. Further, I am not aware of any Congressional initiatives to seek a waiver.

* Because possible water seepage into such a repository is a critical and contentious issue, the National Academy of Sciences was asked to review it. The Academy's review raised legitimate issues that have yet to be resolved; however, it declared the formation of a so-called radioactive slurry to be improbable, saying that any uncertainties ''are not considered sufficient to warrant a hold on research activities currently planned.'' We will continue to work with the Academy to resolve this issue before the plant becomes a permanent repository.
