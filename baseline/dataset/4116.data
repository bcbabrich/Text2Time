A new panel established by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to monitor police corruption had its first meeting yesterday, even as City Council members and some lobbying groups sharpened their complaints that the Mayor had improperly obstructed the role of the Council by creating the commission.

Nicholas Scoppetta, the chairman of the panel announced by the Mayor on Monday, said the two-hour meeting in his law office dealt mainly with organizational concerns: selecting an executive director, staffing and moving into permanent office space.

"It was a good meeting, and we decided that we would meet at least on a weekly basis," said Mr. Scoppetta, a lawyer who served as Commissioner of Investigation in the administrations of Mayors John V. Lindsay and Abraham D. Beame. "We intend to get on with our responsibilities as quickly as possible."

The speed with which the panel began its task underscored Mr. Giuliani's determination to face down the Council, which passed its own law establishing a police monitoring commission with far more sweeping investigative authority than the Mayor's panel.
