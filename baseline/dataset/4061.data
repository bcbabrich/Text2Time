Lawyers for Alex Kelly, the onetime high school wrestling star who fled to Europe when he was charged with raping two teen-age girls a decade ago, are due in court here on Tuesday to begin selecting a jury for a trial of one of the two rape cases.

But after years of orchestrating a strategy aimed at portraying Mr. Kelly as a frightened youth who was wrongly accused, the defense faces sharply increased courtroom risks because of publicity about new charges filed against Mr. Kelly last week, lawyers following the case say.

The new charges, to which Mr. Kelly, 29, pleaded not guilty last Monday, involve accusations by the Darien police that Mr. Kelly was speeding to evade the police, flipped his car over and then ran away, leaving a former girlfriend injured with broken ribs and scalp cuts.

Mr. Kelly has not acknowledged that he was driving the car, and the new charges will not be central at the rape trial. But wide news coverage of an incident involving an injured young woman and a young man on the run, lawyers said, threatens to affect potential jurors' attitudes and undercuts the careful strategy constructed by Mr. Kelly's lawyer.
