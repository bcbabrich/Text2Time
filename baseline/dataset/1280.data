Fans and pundits will surely debate the extent and the quality of the Knicks’ progress this season.

They have a winning record (but just barely).

They are on a pace to make the playoffs (as a lower seed).

They might win a first-round series (though it seems unlikely).

They have an undisputed star in Amar’e Stoudemire (but he is not LeBron James).

Yet the progress is both tangible and indisputable, and a credit to Donnie Walsh, the team president, who over two years dismantled a dysfunctional, overpaid lineup and replaced it with a cohesive, respectable, reasonably priced team.

As Walsh awaits word about his future, it is instructive to look back to the roster he was handed on April 1, 2008, which may look even worse in retrospect than it did at the time.

Six of the 15 players Walsh inherited are out of the league — not counting Eddy Curry, who might as well be. Three others are on N.B.A. rosters but barely playing. That leaves only five players of any significance.

Without further ado, welcome to “The Isiah-era Knicks: Where are they now?”

Thriving, Mostly

Zach Randolph, Memphis Grizzlies Had a brief and forgettable stopover with the Los Angeles Clippers. Now producing the usual gaudy numbers for Memphis: 20 points and a career-best 13.2 rebounds a game. Has not made the playoffs or been part of a winning team, though the Grizzlies have a shot at the eighth seed in the West. Salary in 2008: $13.3 million. Current salary: $17.3 million. How he left: Traded (with Mardy Collins) to Clippers, for Cuttino Mobley and Tim Thomas, on Nov. 21, 2008.

Jamal Crawford, Atlanta Hawks Won the Sixth Man of the Year award last season, simultaneously proving that Crawford was a) one of the better players Isiah Thomas acquired and b) was miscast by Thomas as a starting guard and No. 1 scoring option. Remains a key reserve for playoff-bound Hawks, but scoring and shooting percentages have dipped, to 15.9 points and 43 percent. Salary in 2008: $7.9 million. Current salary: $10.1 million. How he left: Traded to Warriors, for Al Harrington, on Nov. 21, 2008.

David Lee, Golden State Warriors Named an All-Star in final Knicks season, albeit as an injury replacement. Was the best member of a bad Knicks team, averaging 20.2 points and 11.7 rebounds. Now a solid member of a poor Warriors team, averaging 16 points and 9.7 rebounds. Salary in 2008: $990,000. Current salary: $10.8 million. How he left: In sign-and-trade deal with Warriors, for Anthony Randolph, Ronny Turiaf and Kelenna Azubuike, on July 8, 2010.

Nate Robinson, Boston Celtics Other than Crawford, the only Isiah-era Knick to play a major role for a playoff team. Helped fuel Celtics’ Game 4 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers in 2010 N.B.A. finals. Now averaging 7.7 points and shooting .412 as the Celtics’ sixth man. Salary in 2008: $1.3 million. Current salary: $4.2 million. How he left: Traded (with Marcus Landry) to Boston, for Eddie House, Bill Walker and J.R. Giddens, on Feb. 18, 2010.

Wilson Chandler, Knicks Thomas’s best parting gift — a talented, low-maintenance, high-scoring forward who always plays hard and improves every year. Averaging a career-best 17.4 points. Current salary: $2.1 million. Future: A free agent this summer, could be used in trade for Carmelo Anthony or let go to make room for Anthony.

Approaching Irrelevance

Quentin Richardson, Orlando Magic Opened season as a key rotation player, became superfluous when Magic acquired Gilbert Arenas and Jason Richardson. Played 57 minutes in January. Salary in 2008: $8.1 million. Current salary: $2.3 million. How he left: Traded to Memphis, for Darko Milicic, on June 26, 2008.

Jared Jeffries, Houston Rockets Found niche as versatile defender in his final years with Knicks. Niche in Houston is between 13th and 14th seats on the bench. Has made 17 appearances this season, averaging 7.8 minutes. (Side note: Thomas, upon signing Jeffries, said he would “balance the plane ride.”) Salary in 2008: $5.6 million. Current salary: $6.9 million. How he left: Traded to Houston (with Jordan Hill) in three-team deal that brought Tracy McGrady to Knicks, on Feb. 18, 2010.

Renaldo Balkman, Denver Nuggets The hustle. The hair. The Rodman-like nose for the ball. There was little to enjoy about these Knicks, but Balkman’s frantic energy was something. He is more static now: He has played 44 minutes this season. (Side note: Balkman was drafted one spot ahead of Rajon Rondo in 2006.) Salary in 2008: $1.3 million. Current salary: $1.7 million. How he left: Traded to Denver for Taurean Green, Bobby Jones and a second-round pick, on July 28, 2008. (Jones and Green were later waived.)

Eddy Curry, Knicks Symbol of an era of overpaid underachievers. Peaked in 2006-7 (19.5 points a game), regressing ever since. Unable to stay healthy or in shape jeopardizing career. Has appeared in 10 games since start of the 2008-9 season. Salary in 2008: $8.9 million. Current salary: $11.3 million. Future: If Knicks cannot trade his expiring contract by Feb. 24, they will probably waive him.

Off the Grid

Stephon Marbury Benched by Coach Mike D’Antoni. Refused a buyout. Took a buyout. Joined the Celtics. Played sparingly. Declined to re-sign with Celtics. Wanted better offer. Found no other offers. Went on YouTube. Ate Vaseline. Now playing in China. Salary in 2008: $19 million. How he left: Waived Feb. 24, 2009.

Jerome James Often injured, always jovial, rarely in shape. Spent a lot of time on what came to be known as the Jerome James Memorial Stationary Bike. Presumed retired. Salary in 2008: $5.8 million. How he left: Traded (with Tim Thomas, Anthony Roberson) to Chicago for Larry Hughes on Feb. 19, 2009.

Malik Rose Consummate nice guy, veteran of two Spurs championship teams, tried best to infuse professionalism in a chaotic environment. Now a broadcaster for the Spurs. Salary in 2008: $7.1 million. How he left: Traded to Oklahoma City for Chris Wilcox on Feb. 19, 2009.

Mardy Collins Steady, selfless guard. Not particularly good at anything. Out of league after failing to make Washington Wizards last fall. (Side note: Paul Millsap was still on the board when Collins was drafted in 2006.) Salary in 2008: $967,000. How he left: Traded (with Zach Randolph) to Clippers on Nov. 21, 2008.

Fred Jones Won 2004 slam-dunk contest. Won 23 games in only season with the Knicks. Spent 2008-9 with Clippers. Has not been seen since. Salary in 2008: $3.3 million. How he left: Was not re-signed after 2007-8 season.

Randolph Morris When Knicks signed him straight out of college — via little-known loophole — Thomas said Randolph was like an extra first-round pick. Like an extra Mardy Collins. Salary in 2008: $810,000. How he left: Was not re-signed after 2007-8 season.
