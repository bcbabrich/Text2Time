The statement said that there was “no basis whatsoever — in fact or in common sense,” for the charge by Mr. Agnew's lawyers that officials of the department had leaked information to the press in an effort to prejudice the proceedings against the Vice President. It went on to suggest that Mr. Agnew had precipitated the leaks by disclosing on Aug. 8 that he was under investigation.

All day Friday, as he golfed with Mr. Sinatra on the Tamarisk Country Club course bordering the singer's milliondollar estate and rested at one of the four guest houses in the hideaway, the Vice President was said to have fumed about the statement. He re portedly talked of “going public” with a rejoinder and began mentally sketching its outlines.

“But he tainped, it all down at breakfast” the next morning, an associate said. “He said it would not be good politics” to spell out what was on his mind, but decided to make “one or two points” after completing the delivery of a prepared speech on the need for secrecy in the grand jury to protect, the innocent.

The Vice President's aides passed the word to newsmen at the Los Angeles Convention Center that Mr. Agnew would make some pointed comments at the end of the address. He did, without notes, and “once he got started it was as if he couldn't stop,” the associate later remarked.

Mr. Agnew referred to having “been living in purgatory” because of unspecified charges against him. He said that the violations of grand jury secrecy were not his fault but “deliberate, contrived actions” of Government prosecutors. The Atig. 1 letter received from United States Attorney George Beall in Baltimore, notifying him that he was under investigation, was made available to The Wall Street Journal even before he received it. Mr. Agnew declared.

The associates said that the Vice President regretted his omission of one point that had troubled him — the published speculation that he had sought to make a deal with the prosecutors, offering to resign if the charges were dropped—and that he later wished he had denied those accounts on television.

Instead, he told a group of Republican officials with whom he met after the speech that the “plea bargaining” had been initiated by the Justice Department and had, never been. seriously considered by him. His aides then let newsmen know of the private discussion.
