''It's a completely clandestine operation; they don't even know we're there,'' said George B. Litchford, an engineer who holds the system's patent. Mr. Litchford has been licensing the technology to Megadata since 1989. Megadata is thought to be the only company in this business so far. It is hardly a gold-mine business. Megadata, whose stock is thinly traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, has revenue of less than $2 million a year from a range of communications products, and it lost money last year. The shares closed at 50 cents today, down 37.5 cents each, after spiking upward Tuesday on word of the company's involvement in the plane-crash investigation.

Though the National Transportation Safety Board was unaware of Megadata's existence before the crash, the F.A.A. has known about the company but typically ignored it.

Megadata's services may be useful to airlines for efficiently moving people on the ground, said Bill Jeffers, the F.A.A.'s director of air traffic. But ''it doesn't have to do with the safe and efficient movement of aircraft,'' which Mr. Jeffers said was his agency's concern.

Yet, in the case of the T.W.A. crash, Megadata's records proved invaluable to Federal officials.

After Mr. Keller's phone call, safety board investigators and agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation went to Megadata's office to view charts and determine what other aircraft were in position to see the final moments of Flight 800. Eyewitness reports are considered by aviation experts to be extremely unreliable, and the Megadata information helped establish whether the other pilots were in positions to see what they claimed to see.

Based on scans from an F.A.A. radar in Riverhead, L.I., Megadata's charts showed that two aircraft -- an Air National Guard helicopter and airplane -- were indeed in position to have seen the fireball.

F.A.A. radar systems of the type used in Riverhead send out pulses of energy that are reflected off metal objects in the sky, creating blips on a screen. The systems also send out electronic queries, asking the identity and altitude of planes with transponders -- special radios that can respond to F.A.A. queries by emitting electronic identification codes a millionth of a second later.

Subtracting that microsecond and dividing by the speed of light, the F.A.A. knows the range, or how far away the plane is. By keeping track of precisely where the circular-scan radar beam is pointed when it asks the question, the F.A.A. knows the direction, or bearing, of the aircraft.
