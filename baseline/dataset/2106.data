The education of Donald Young continues.

He has had it hard, losing in the first round in five tournaments this year. He has had it easy, advancing to the third round of the United States Open with a walkover past 13th-seeded Richard Gasquet.

Saturday at Louis Armstrong Stadium, the 18-year-old junior champion received a dose of grind-it-out Grand Slam tennis as he lost to 50th-ranked Feliciano Lopez, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (5), 7-5.

Young showed flashes of brilliance. He won the first set with two service winners after he had blown an easy putaway off a net chord; he finished with 45 winners. He also showed flashes of inconsistency as he committed 45 unforced errors. But mostly he showed the fortitude to battle on a stadium court in front of an enthusiastic crowd.

The final point total: Lopez 132, Young 125.

Young, who is listed on the ATP Web site as 5-foot-9-inches tall and weighing 145 pounds showed surprising power, hitting 11 aces as his served reached a high of 135 miles per hour.

Lopez did just enough to win — in fact, the match always rested on Young racket. Lopez traded lefty groundstrokes with him today, weathering many winners off Young’s best shot: the acute crosscourt forehand, his monstrous spin shooting the ball off the sideline and out of reach.

With a staunchly partisan, capacity crowd in Louis Armstrong Stadium shouting “C’mon Donald, we’re rooting for you” and “Go D-Money” and even one “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” it’s clear many see Young as the future of American tennis.

Near the end of the pivotal third set against Lopez, Young put his entire arsenal on diplay in his best point of the match to get to 6-5. The point started with a number of groundstrokes, Young hitting the heavier strokes and pushing Lopez from side to side. As Young approached the net, Lopez hit a perfect lob that landed just inside the baseline. Young hit the accelerator, wheeling to the baseline and blazing the ball directly at Lopez, who deftly dropped the ball just over the net. Quickly reversing course, Young charged the net, reaching the drop shot with plenty of time to hit the winning passer.

But Lopez held serve, leading to the third set tie break. The more experienced Lopez played the big points safely, while Young continued to go for winners. The crowd gasped “Oh!” when he shanked a difficult overhead. They cheered his flat, backhand winner. There were gasps on almost every point, as Young has the kind of topspin that keeps fans wondering if the ball will sail long, but usually, just in the nick of time, it lands in the court, often well within the baseline.

Unfortunately for Young, not enough of these shots dropped. His last shot of the set went long and he was down two sets to one, a deficit he was unable to overcome. He then almost hit the ball out of Armstrong Court, drawing a code violation.

For American tennis fans, this match was no cause for despair. Young showed off his talent and speed, and there will no doubt be many more victories to come. He also showed off his two biggest weaknesses — his service game and groundstroke consistency — and, at 18, he still has time to work on those and mature as a player.
