Since he went down in the second game of last season with a severe injury to his right knee, defensive end Jeff Lageman has been working toward the goal of hitting the field for the team's regular-season opener.

It now looks as if Lageman has reached his goal. When the defense takes the field against Denver on Sunday, Lageman will line up at the starting left end position. He will play in a brace that will protect his reconstructed knee.

Coach Bruce Coslet said Lageman would be monitored closely.

"If somebody has a real long drive against us, we might take him out in the middle of that drive," Coslet said. "Or if somebody has a drive against us and we turn the ball over real quick and the defense is right back on the field, then we might consider resting him a few snaps before he goes back in. It's a fatigue type thing." Keeping Count

Coslet, bowing to caution, held Lageman out of the first preseason game against Pittsburgh. Lageman played 10 snaps in the second game against Philadelphia and 20 snaps against the Giants.
