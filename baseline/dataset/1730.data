CORTLAND, N.Y. — The more time that Rex Ryan spends in front of the cameras, the more it becomes clear that should this whole coaching thing not pan out, he would make one heck of a stand-up comedian.

I like to watch the other reporters when Ryan cracks jokes. Sometimes, they hold their stomachs to stifle laughter. Other times, they try to bottle that laughter, but fail miserably, nearly falling off their chairs.

I wrote about Ryan – and the contrast in styles with Eric Mangini, the former coach – for an article that is online and will run in Sunday’s paper. Regardless, the jokes just keep on coming. What follows are a few excerpts from Ryan’s latest stand-up routine, er, news conference, held on Saturday morning. A news conference that started, it should be noted, with Ryan jogging to the podium and pronouncing he was getting his “jog on.”

On the first scuffle of training camp, between offensive tackle Damien Woody and defensive end Shaun Ellis on Saturday morning:

A: That’s one that nobody would break up. Like, Guys, just keep fighting until you die.

On what safety Jim Leonhard looks like without pads on:

A: I told both him and (Danny) Woodhead that my kid is playing for Summit High School, and that if there is a conflict, they need to play for us and not Summit. They were having to do both I think (laughs). They look like they can be in high school.



On Day II of his diet:

A: Why’d you bring that up (laughing)? Let me tell you this – the vegetable part of it, way worse than I even thought. We should have a bonus cup for anybody who would like to give it a shot. I’m not kidding. We can put one here. You guys can see it. (The color) is hard to describe, it (looks) like rust (laughs). I plugged in my nose to drink it. It’s absolutely brutal. But hey, I’m hanging in there. It’s Day Two, so we’ll see.

On Kris Jenkins’s calf injury:

A: (It will be) a few days for Jenkins. (He will) definitely miss the special teams practice (laughing). I don’t think we’re going to have Jenkins long snap today (laughs).

Comedy aside, Ryan addressed several more newsy topics. Kellen Clemens looked as sharp as a Marine’s sword early during the morning practice, including on a deep ball he floated to receiver Jerricho Cotchery in double coverage for a gain of about 50 yards. But Clemens tempered that excitement with two more interceptions, giving him three total picks in the first three practices.

“You see that he’s got a really good grasp of this system,” Ryan said. “This is his fourth year. When you talk about the difference right now with him and Mark, Sanchez is out there going through it, learning a little bit, where Clemens knows it. He has a great grasp of it and makes very few mistakes with his checks.”

Clemens outperformed Sanchez on Saturday, although it’s impossible to say that one quarterback leads the other after two days.

Sanchez worked with the second team, had several passes batted down, and when the second-team offensive line came off the field after one series, guard Stanley Daniels announced to his fellow linemen within earshot of reporters that “he doesn’t have his cadence down.” Daniels was presumably talking about the quarterback.

Sanchez did struggle with his cadence in the off-season – he even practiced by shouting in front of his mirror at a hotel – but Ryan said later he had improved. That said, one of the Jets biggest problems so far, according to Ryan, was too many false-start penalties. And cadence is one part of that.

“That’s what we have to learn from offensively – don’t put yourself in a hole,” Ryan said, speaking specifically about the penalties. “We talked about this earlier, about how if you have to beat us physically, this is going to be a tough football team to beat. We can’t have those mistakes.”

Both of Clemens’s interceptions landed in the hands of Leonhard, nicknamed White Lightning by his former teammates in Baltimore. Ryan said that Leonhard disguises coverages as well as anyone in the N.F.L. other than his former Ravens teammate Ed Reed.

On the injury front, nose tackle Kris Jenkins limped off the field during the morning practice with a calf injury. Jenkins will miss some practice time, probably less than a week, and said: “It’s nothing serious. I won’t skip a beat.” Woodhead missed practice in the morning after a hit knocked him woozy on Friday, but he returned in the afternoon wearing a red no-contact jersey.

The rookie running back Shonn Greene did not have an injury during practice, but he did absorb a vicious and legal blow from linebacker Bryan Thomas. Ryan called this Greene’s “welcome to the N.F.L. moment.”

Ryan also said that he wanted the Jets to increase the tempo of practice, and there was a noticeable difference between the Saturday and Friday sessions.
