Unable to resolve the major issue‐the participation of the Palestine Liberation Organization at Geneva‐Mr. Vance and President Anwar el‐Sadat of Egypt at televised news conference sought to put the best face on what was a fallback position if a Geneva session could not evolve from the Secretary's current trip.

As explained by Mr. Vance, he will try to persuade Syria, Jordan and Israel to join Egypt in a working group and to meet under his auspices in Washington and New York starting in ned‐September.
