Banca Commerciale Italiana said that Italian regulators had indicated that they would approve its bid to buy 51 percent of the Irving Bank Corportion at $80 a share. The offer has the approval of Irving's management and directors and is competing with a hostile offer from the Bank of New York Company. Banca Commerciale's bid must still be approved by the Federal Reserve Board, which is expected to take several months.

Irving's stock was unchanged yesterday at $62.375 a share, or slightly below the $64.81-a-share value of the Bank of New York's offer. The Bank of New York, whose stock rose 12.5 cents a share, to $31.625, is offering $15 cash and 1.575 of its shares for each Irving share.
