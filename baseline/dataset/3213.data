Bowing to reality but still confident about growth, executives of Home Depot Inc. reduced the company's expected earnings growth yesterday to an increase of 18 to 20 percent a year for the next three years. Last year, they had predicted a growth rate of 23 percent to 25 percent for the company.

The announcement came at the company's annual meeting for Wall Street analysts and investors in Atlanta, where Home Depot, the country's biggest home-improvement chain, is based. Investors appeared to like the news, driving shares of Home Depot up $2.63, to $46.65, in the heaviest trading since September.

''It was a relief rally,'' said Colin McGranahan, a retail analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''The numbers were what I expected, and pretty much what the market expected.''

It was the first meeting led by the chairman and chief executive, Robert L. Nardelli, who replaced Home Depot's founders less than a year ago after a long career at General Electric. Like many executives in retail, Mr. Nardelli watched the ground shift beneath him as the sputtering economy and the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 made shoppers newly cost-conscious and reluctant to make any but the most essential purchases. That shift has required the company to embrace a plan of action that makes cost cutting as important as rapid expansion.
