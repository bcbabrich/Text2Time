BERLIN, Oct. 31 — Nearly 80,000 West Berliners crossed the Berlin wall today on the second day of the first period for visits with relatives in East Berlin, under the recently‐con­cluded East‐West German ar­rangement for such trips.

Four street crossings of the wall were used by the visitors, in addition to subway and ele­vated trains.

During the present two‐week visiting period, each West Ber­liner eligible for one‐day passes can make one visit across the border, with two more visits to follow during the Christmas holidays. Two further visits have been set for next Easter and Whitsuntide.

During the first such ar­rangement last Christmas 1.2 million West Berliners made the trip to the East.
