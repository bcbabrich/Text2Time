CURRY is the chameleon of the table. It not only comes in assorted colors -- yellow, red and green -- but also can transform an ordinary dish into something aromatic and exotic. Shuffle the seasonings and an Indian dish can take on a Thai, Burmese or Caribbean personality. It can even taste French. Now, as Americans hanker for ever-spicier foods, curries of all sorts are becoming more common here.

Since 1987, according to the American Spice Trade Association, sales of cumin and turmeric, the two main components of curry, have risen strikingly, up 65 percent for cumin, which gives curry its aromatic, slightly bitter intensity, and 40 percent for turmeric, the dried root that gives yellow curry its color. Curry's heat comes from pepper and chilies, and their sales are also skyrocketing.

The standard yellow curry powder, though, is just one of many seasonings now available. Increasingly, stores are stocking curries from a number of countries, in both "dry," or powdered form, and "wet," or paste. Among the new wet seasonings available in stores now are Indian curries like Instant India and Curry King. Two of the many brands of Thai varieties are Taste of Thai and Thai Chef. Some of these products are made in the United States, while others are imported, not only from Asia, but also from Canada, where two interesting brands of Indian-style pastes are Himalayan Gourmet and Shahi.

Aside from being wet or dry, yellow (with turmeric), red (with red chilies) or green (hotter, with green chilies), curries also fall into two other categories: for tourists and for purists.
