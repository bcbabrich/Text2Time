The director Ulrich Seidl's ''Dog Days,'' which takes place during the miserably hot summer in Vienna, is a roiling mix of anger, resentment and need: the often destructive power of love. We see this in the first sequence, when the belligerently jealous Mario (Ren√© Wanko) threatens the guys who look at his girlfriend, Klaudia (Franziska Weiss); he seems to leave pools of testosterone wherever he steps.

After he forces her unwanted suitors away and floors his car through the streets of Vienna, he screams at Klaudia and throws her out of the car. We then get the credit sequence, with several groups of people shown sunning themselves under the piercing sun; the pictures could be a melting mess bringing together Francis Bacon and David Hockney. (The cinematography by Wolfgang Thaler has been scaled to the emotional pitch of the material.)

With these shots of the pale cast of characters, we can almost feel the melanoma developing. Mr. Seidl treats the chemistry of human relationships like a cancer, an enormous growth that, unchecked, leads to disease.

And he fixates on flesh, scouring it with his camera to search for a trace of the humanity within. (The film has unflinching nudity and sexuality, and ''Dog Days'' doesn't believe that love and physical contact are mutually inclusive.) He doesn't find much; the men and women in ''Dog Days'' are broken down into bullies and victims. There are further couplings between Mario and Klaudia; she is drawn to his brutality for reasons never made clear, but the bond between them has an awkward realism.
