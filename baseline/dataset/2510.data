Correction Appended

Helicopters swept the sky, and clusters of police officers stood guard on street corners. But for revelers in Times Square, the New Year's Eve countdown was about party, not panic.

With the nation on a heightened terror alert, security was tight throughout the city. In Times Square, where crowds began forming early yesterday afternoon, police officers looked through backpacks and checked celebrants with metal detectors.

Even so, revelers streamed into Times Square for the time-worn tradition. Though there was no official crowd count, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said the numbers were high.

''We're going to have a record crowd tonight, they are backed up to Central Park,'' he said as he left dinner at a Times Square restaurant.
