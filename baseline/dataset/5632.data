The House of Representatives will bid a fond, sentimental and bipartisan farewell tonight to Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., who is retiring when Congress adjourns, probably in the next few days.

Since 1980 the senior elected Democrat, Mr. O'Neill has spent virtually all his adult life in politics.

He was elected to the Massachusetts legislature in 1936 when he was 23 years old and served until 1952, the last four years as Speaker of the House. In 1952 he was elected to the House of Representative, where he has served 34 years, the last 16 as a member of the Democratic leadership and the last 10 as Speaker.

When the House concludes its regular business this evening, leaders of both parties will salute the Speaker with floor tributes. It is not a surprise party. A screen will be installed behind the rostrum for a special O'Neill film, which features his cameo appearance in the television show ''Cheers'' in a Boston bar. Then all hands will adjourn to the Capitol Rotunda for a reception honoring Mr. O'Neill and his family.
