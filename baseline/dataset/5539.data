Roberto Duran, fighting for the first time in 19 months, scored a dramatic second-round knockout tonight over Manuel Esteban Zambrano, the Colombian middleweight champion.

Duran, who was knocked out by Thomas Hearns in a World Boxing Council middleweight title bout in his last fight, sent Zambrano to his knees with a left hook to the ribs. Referee Carlos Berrocal counted out the Colombian at 2 minutes 57 seconds of the second round as Zambrano struggled to regain standing position.

Duran, who weighed in at 165 pounds, is scheduled to fight again March 1, but his opponent has not been chosen.

Zambrano weighed in at 163 pounds.
