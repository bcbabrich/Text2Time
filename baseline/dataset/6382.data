“I was never worse than third,” he said. “I was behind George Lewis and Ranchos Lejos along the back side, carefully staying wide of them in case they collapsed. They did and I was In front without even trying for it. My horse handled the track well and I thought my chances were good. But once he tired, he lost his rhythm and that did him in. I looked ahead and Dust Com mander kept getting smaller and smaller as he kept going away from me.”

Perhaps the most surprising of the dis appointed jocks was Eddie Belmonte, the mod‐fashion‐plate who rode Personality the more highly regarded of John Jacobs's entry. He was a stunning eighth, while his stablemate, High Echelon was in the money as third finisher.

“At the three‐eighths pole,” said Eddie, “my horse was full of running. I know him and what he can do. I even was beginning to smell roses. That's how confident I was. We were in good position and everything was breaking good. He was moving nice and beautiful. But some where near the quarter‐pole there was a patch of water on the track.

“Now this is a young, inexperienced horse. He's still leading but he's a shadow jumper. You know, he jumps at shadows. When he saw the water he swerved and ducked in and out. He never got back in proper stride. I know he can do better.”

Fashion Tailored

Eddie reached into his locker and fin gered the velvet suit he had especially tailored for the victory party. The trousers are emerald green and the jacket is salmon pink. The colors of the Jacobs family. Per haps he can wear it more happily after the Preakness or Belmont.

But the other jock on the other Jacobs starter, Larry Adams, emerged from some misadventures with a third place on High Echelon. The big unpredictable gray also has bad jumping habits.

“He jumped across the path in front of the grandstand,” said Larry, shaking his head in disbelief. “It took at least a quar ter of a mile for him to regain momentum and we dropped back to 17th and last place. That should show you how far he had to come and how well he did it.
