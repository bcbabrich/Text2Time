An international gathering of Christian counselors here is undertaking an ambitious idea: reduce divorce among church members by training 100,000 married couples over the next five years to be ''marriage mentors'' for people getting married or working to keep their marriages going.

The idea, written as a brief statement called ''Commitment to Building Healthy Marriages,'' has been printed on a poster and mounted on an easel, so it can be endorsed by those attending the meeting of the American Association of Christian Counselors. Among the first to sign was the Rev. Jerry Falwell, whose Liberty University has just begun a doctoral program in pastoral and professional counseling.

''It is clear that the breakdown of the family -- 50 percent-plus divorce rate -- bleeds over into the Christian community,'' Mr. Falwell said in an interview.

Indeed, a recent survey by the Barna Research Group, a market research firm in Ventura, Calif., found that born-again Christians were about as likely to divorce as other Americans. Lately, too, news articles have reported that divorce rates in some Bible Belt states are the nation's highest.
