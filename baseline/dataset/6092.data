WASHINGTON, Sept. 1—A controversial study that paints a bleak portrait of United States defenses has emerged as the focus of an emotional debate involving Congress and the Pentagon.

The study, by John M. Collins, senior specialist in national defense with the Library of Congress's Congressional Research Service, says that quantitative changes in American and Soviet armed forces favor the Soviet Union, with scattered exceptions. The document also contends that American intercontinental missiles are increasingly vulnerable to Soviet attack.

Attention has been focused on the report as a result of recent allegations in Congress that the document had been “suppressed” because it conflicts with the generally optimistic Administration view of the United States ‐Soviet military balance. The study was placed in the Congressional Record last month by Senator Jesse A. Helms, Republican of North Carolina.

Work to Be Reviewed

Since then, Mr. Collins, a retired army colonel and specialist in strategic and tactical planning, has been denied a pay increase that he was scheduled to receive and warned that his work is not up to acceptable levels of competence. Mr. Collins has also been informed that his future work must be reviewed by a group of designated peers.
