The first Tokyo International Film Festival opened today with the premiere of ''Ran,'' a Shakespearean story in a Japanese feudal setting by Japan's most acclaimed director, Akira Kurosawa.

A total of 137 films from 42 countries are to be screened during the 10-day festival.

''Ran,'' or ''Turmoil,'' was not completed in time for the Cannes Film Festival this month. Mr. Kurosawa spent nine months shooting the film, his 27th, which he has said ''is to round out my life's work in films.'' It cost $10.4 million, unusually expensive for a Japanese film.

The 75-year-old director has described ''Ran'' as a rendition of Shakespeare's ''King Lear'' in a 16th-century Japanese setting.
