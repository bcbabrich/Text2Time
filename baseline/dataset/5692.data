Jules Kirschenbaum (Forum Gallery, 1018 Madison Avenue between 78th and 79th Streets): Jules Kirschenbaum is one of the more complex painters now working in a realistic idiom. His work is allegorical, filled with literary allusions and deeply introspective; at the same time, it not only contains images of Japanese erotica, but also the paint and texture sometimes seem to breathe sexuality. While his work could hardly be more meticulous in its rendering of objects, Kirschenbaum also twists and turns his pictorial space in search of the visionary.

A handful of works in this show leave no doubt about his gifts. In ''David Harris Playing Scarlatti,'' a pianist is lost in his playing while the body of the piano and the fantastic shapes on the inside of the lid begin to float into space. In ''Auto da Fe III,'' a figure sits at a table, scratching his head, surrounded by a painting by Giovanni Bellini, a painting by Grunewald, an erotic Japanese print and Uccello's ''Battle of San Romano.'' One of the horses in the Uccello has tumbled out of the painting and lies on the studio floor. In ''Studio II,'' there is an almost excruciating tension between a voluptuous, female nude model, seated alone in the middle of a studio, and the suggestively masculine forms all around her.

''Between Abstraction and Reali

ty'' (Marilyn Pearl Gallery, 38 East 57th Street): I hope that ''Between Abstraction and Reality'' will inspire a larger and more disinterested exhibition. This show's subject is a tendency in contemporary American painting to combine landscape and abstraction in a way that continues the tradition in American painting of Albert Pinkham Ryder, Arthur Dove and Marsden Hartley. Unrepresentative works by Georgia O'Keeffe, Dove, Hartley, Charles Demuth, Lee Krasner and Jackson Pollock are in this show. The contemporary painters are Gregory Amenoff, Anna Bialabroda, Bill Jensen and Katherine Porter. There are three sculptors as well, but they only blunt further the point the show makes.

The contrast between the earlier and the contemporary American artists is instructive. With Dove, Krasner and Pollock, the earth was so much in their blood that they did not have to worry about it being in their work. As long as their painting reflected their deepest thoughts and feelings, the earth would be there. The younger artists are approaching landscape after all the years when progressive art rejected it, and they are far more wary and removed. Amenoff calls attention to the movement and texture of the paint itself. In Porter's work, landscape imagery and urban sophistication seem almost to be pitted against each other. Only in Jensen's painting do the abstract elements become a way of tapping the full force of the natural world. (Through tomorrow.)

''From Organism to Architecture'' (New York Studio School, 8 West Eighth Street): In order to get anything out of this show, it is necessary to forget its title. ''From Organism to Architecture'' immediately suggests to me that evolution from organic form to architectural structure that took place in the work of Mondrian and Kandinsky. Although a dialogue between geometric structure and organic form generally seems to be the subject of the show, this dialogue is still so widespread that the selections could only be extremely arbitrary. Only the organizer, the painter Ross Bleckner, knows for sure. It was certainly impossible for this visitor to tell what he was trying to say from his babbling accompanying statement.

As long as no one is looking for a coherent argument or a historical perspective, the show has something to say. It makes the point that the tension and dialogue between organic and architectural are continuing, and it focuses attention on scale. Iris Mitchell's four paintings could only work at their almost miniature scale. The same is true of the 10 small and very diverse paintings by the late Victor Alzamora that are the heart of the show. The effectiveness of these works has an instructive effect on the other, mostly larger works, making many of them looser and more overblown than they would appear to be on their own. The painting by Cy Twombly neatly fits the title of the show and looks very good. So does the finely constructed portrait by Max Beckmann. But what this portrait is doing in the show is anybody's guess. (Through March 15.)
