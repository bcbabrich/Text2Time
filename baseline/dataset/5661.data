President Reagan's meeting this week with Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone of Japan, like his recent meetings with the leaders of West Germany and Britain, looks to be little more than a courtesy visit. That's too bad, because there's serious business waiting to be done.

When he was asked the other day if he would press Mr. Nakasone to be more hospitable to American goods and correct a growing trade imbalance, Mr. Reagan replied: ''How can I get tough with a very good friend?'' Nor was this merely a polite cover story; the meeting in Los Angeles is to last less than three hours, including lunch. But if they won't talk firmly now, when?

Japan's trade with the United States is disturbingly unbalanced. Japanese exporters in 1984 sold Americans wares worth $35 billion more than those sold by Americans in Japan. That's more than a quarter of America's worrisome worldwide trade deficit. The gap need not be closed, but it has to be narrowed.

What's likely in 1985, however, is that it will widen. In part, that's because of the faster growth of the American economy, sucking in still more imports from all over. But both Governments deserve blame for not doing enough to correct the imbalance.
