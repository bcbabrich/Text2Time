An article in The Arts on Sept. 20 about the success of "Rock Star: INXS" on CBS referred imprecisely to songs performed on the show that have rarely been made available to other prime-time shows or commercials. "Imagine" by John Lennon and "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen have also been performed on the prime-time show "American Idol."
