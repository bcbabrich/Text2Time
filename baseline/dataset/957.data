TUESDAY’S PUZZLE — Well, you knew it was going to happen, and here it is. A puzzle about the newly-elected PONTIFF, POPE FRANCIS, by Ian Livengood.

It’s only Tuesday, and it’s the sort of theme that even I wouldn’t try to poke fun at, so I won’t give the rest of it away. It’s a pretty easy solve, however, and the rest of the puzzle is smooth as well. The only other thing I’ll say is that I liked seeing the word PEACE under the new PONTIFF’s name at 67 Across.

I love me some MOCHAS when I am at Starbucks, and will practically do THE WAVE on my own if they shave some chocolate on top. Did anyone else feel a slight twinge of embarrassment at seeing the words SEXT and EROTICA in a grid about the POPE? No? Just me?

Have you ever wondered what it takes to guard the POPE? Here is an interesting video on what it takes to become a member of the elite SWISS GUARD:
