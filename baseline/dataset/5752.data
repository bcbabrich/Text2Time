Dr. Cary Goodman was not satisfied with the kind of entertainment that children were getting. So three months ago, he and some other grown-ups took crayons to paper and drew a picture of what a world's fair for youngsters would look like.

Their ideas came to life Saturday when a parade of children marched through the gates of the Asphalt Green in colorful, shimmering costumes to begin New York's first annual Children's Worlds Fair.

Performers came from as near as the city's own neighborhoods and as far as Crete. The Greek island sent a dance troupe, and they joined other musicians and artists in the eight-hour festival.

Around the Asphalt Green, at 555 East 90th Street, exotic dances and songs were performed on stages representing five continents. Cardboard versions of an Egyptian pyramid and the Great Wall of China were displayed. So was a European castle, this one made of sand.
