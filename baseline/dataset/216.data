It has been a hard year for romaine. A national food-poisoning outbreak tied to the lettuce this winter sickened hundreds of people across 35 states and killed five. The threat has passed, but the sting lingers. Romaine, for many households, is still a tough sell. In mine, commodity iceberg, that old crunchy friend, has lately been in ascendance, and wedge salads have been the order of the day: pale green-white triangles drizzled in pale white-blue dressing, with crumbles of bacon and bright red pops of cherry tomato, and pricks of green chive strewn across the top. The crunch of it, the bright colors, the sweet and salt seem to please the children. Adults, too.

In restaurants, of course, wedge salads have done well for years, even decades, as essential steakhouse fare — “iceberg wedges, blue cheese, bacon” was Roger Sterling’s order on “Mad Men” when he and Don Draper saved the Madison Square Garden account in Season 3, set in 1963. But there is no reason not to bring them home. “There’s something special about this blank-slate, juicy and crisp wad of iceberg that’s dripping with fat and crunch,” Brooks Headley, the chef and owner of Superiority Burger in New York City, told me. “Doesn’t need a fancier lettuce. Just needs the bacon just right and the blue cheese not too fancy but also just right.”
