tonal guidance specialists, this is known as hitting the daily double.

If Commissioner Kennedy has come a fair piece from his beginnings, so has professional roundball. It was 26 years ago when Walter Kennedy, press agent for the N.B.A.'s fledgling predecessor, the Basketball Association of America, arranged a luncheon meeting between Maurice Podoloff, the organization's president, and Harold Rosenthal, who was writing a profile of basketball's infant czar for the New York Herald Tribune. Telephoning later to make sure the interview had gone well, Kennedy asked, “Where did he take you to lunch?”

“I hate to tell you,” Rosenthal said. “We sat at the counter in Lindy's spa” (a luncheonette on 53d Street long since vanished in a cloud of bicarbonate). When the N.B.A. held a news conference the other day to announce the extension and reinforcement of the commissioner's powers, the meeting was held in the alcoholic opulence of Twenty One.

The decision to strengthen Kennedy's hand was news worthy on two counts. For one, the action was unanimous, and it is a rare day in November when those 17 club owners agree on what time it is. For another, in conferring the robe and scepter of absolute monarchy on their leader, they were running directly counter to current trends.

Twilight of the Czars

In most professional sports, the bottom has just about dropped out of the czar business. The first and toughest of the overlords was Landis, who came to power in 1920 and ruled with a heavy hand until his death in 1944. But if baseball started with Little Caesar, it wound up with Ethelred the Unready.
