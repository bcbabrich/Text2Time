LUBBOCK, Tex. — Saturday night’s showdown between top-ranked Texas and No. 6 Texas Tech is being hailed as the biggest game this dusty West Texas city has ever seen.

The game is expected to attract more than 56,000 fans and set a new attendance record for Jones AT&T Stadium. Texas Tech fans were encouraged to wear black attire for a blackout effect.

The matchup also prompted ESPN’s College GameDay to make its first visit here.

Outside the stadium this week, a couple thousand students formed a tent city called Raiderville. Texas Tech Coach Mike Leach visited Raiderville residents Thursday and fed them barbecue.

The actors Matthew McConaughey, a Texas fan, and Brad Leland, a Texas Tech alum who is on the television show “Friday Night Lights,” both have sideline passes.

“We’ve had so many demands on tickets,” Texas Tech Athletic Director Gerald Myers said in a telephone interview. “We could sell 15,000 more tickets I think for this game.”
