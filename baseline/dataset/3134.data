The state's 30 poorest school districts will receive $315 million in supplemental state aid for next school year, only about a fourth of the $1.2 billion in supplemental aid the districts had requested, the state Department of Education announced last week. Supplemental aid pays for programs, like full-day sessions for preschoolers and increased teaching staffs, that were required by the state Supreme Court in the long-running dispute over funding for poor, mainly urban districts known as Abbott vs. Burke. The supplemental aid is in addition to the $2.9 billion the state already has allocated for the 30 poorest districts out of the nearly $6 billion that is appropriated for all school districts.
