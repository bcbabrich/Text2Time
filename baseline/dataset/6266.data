WASHINGTON, Oct. 31—Over a one‐month period in the fall of 1969, President Nixon made 21 separate requests to his top aides to take action to counter what the President saw as unfavorable news coverage, according to a memorandum made public tonight by senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr.

The memorandum, written by Jeb Stuart Magruder, then a White House assistant, to H. R. Haldeman, who was the Presidential chief of staff, said that “shotgunning the rr.edia” was not effective.

It suggested that the Administration could better “get the media” if it used such tactics as harassment by the Internal Revenue Service and the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department.

Attached to the memorandum was a log of the President's requests between the middle of September and the middle of October. 1969.
