Simms's test will come if Parcells's Jets sink into a losing streak, or if Simms's reverence becomes too evident. As an analyst, Simms has proven to be one of the best; honest about plays but rarely critical personally.

''Whether they win or lose, there'll be a lot to say,'' Simms said.

''Our relationship will never change. I'm still the player; he's still the coach. I hold him in reverence. Maybe that's not a good thing for a journalist, but that's the situation.''

Last Friday, Simms became one of numerous Giants alumni to visit the Jets' camp or be employed by the team, from Carl Banks and Pepper Johnson to Mark Bavaro and Jumbo Elliott.

''I felt bad for the ex-Jets,'' said Simms, ''especially the ones who played a long time. But Bill says, 'I need people around me who know what I want so I don't have to coach them.' Still, I wonder how the old Jets must feel. I wish they could be there. I'd have the same feeling.''

Watching the Jets practice made Simms feel as if he had never played. ''It was like, 'Wow, look at this,' as if I'd never done it before.' Then Jumbo comes by. And he's huge. But what amazes me is I used to talk to Jumbo like he was one my kids. 'Do this! Do that!' He could have driven me down like a nail. But he didn't. That's the general order of things. I was the quarterback.''

Although Simms's feelings toward Parcells have obviously not changed, his partisanship toward the Giants -- they released him unceremoniously in 1994 -- has faded. ''I've moved on,'' he said. ''But when I played, I hated the A.F.C.''

NBC is the American Football Conference network, so Simms is allegiant to it. And this season, for the first time, he will call a Jets game.
