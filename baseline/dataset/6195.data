‘Amalgamation’ Is Offered

That, he said, was the source of his concern, not any fear that the memorandum would embarrass the President, the State Department or the Secretary of State. He offered to “amalgamate” the contents of the Boyatt memorandum into a summary that would be .presented to the committee without any indication of what elements had originated with Mr. Boyatt.

In addition to his roles as Secretary of State• and as President Ford's adviser on national security, Mr. Kissinger is one of four high Government officials who sits on the 40 Committee—so named for the number of .the Presidential directive that established it.

The committee is in the midst of an examination of what its chairman, representative Otis G. Pike, Democrat of Suffolk, has termed the “risks” that attend such covert activities and the degree of control the Administration exercise over them.

Following the conclusion of Mr. Kissinger's public testimony the panel voted to close its doors and to begin with him process by which details of some covert operations could be made public.

Representative James P. Johnson, Republican of Colorado, made the motion to continue Mr. Kissinger's appearance in executive session, and said that some of the undercover intelligence made known to the committee thus far amounted, in his opinion, to “possible violations of the laws of the United States.”

That opinion was echoed earlier by Representative Ronald V. Dellums, Democrat of California who read to Mr. Kissinger a litany of what he .termed abuses by the intelligence community and by Mr. Kissinger himself. Mr. .Dellums charged that the Secretary had failed to share with ‘ other agencies “the essence of .your conversations with international leaders.”

Mr. Kissinger appeared to bristle slightly at Mr. Dellums's questions. “I regret that you hold those views,” the Secretary said, “especially on the basis’ of such insufficient evi• dence.”
