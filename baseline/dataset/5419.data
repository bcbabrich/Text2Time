Between them, Rainer Crone and Elizabeth Ferrer of the Columbia faculty persuaded Professor Schapiro to let them show 65 of his paintings and drawings in the Wallach Gallery. Even if we know that his first teacher was John Sloan, there is something remarkable about the forthrightness of the self-portrait drawing that he made when he was 16. As for the two portrait drawings of Whittaker Chambers, whom he knew well in 1923, they have a bite and a grip that are astonishing for someone who was barely 19 at the time.

Meyer Schapiro has always been around artists, and from Max Weber and Stuart Davis to Barnett Newman, Donald Judd and R. B. Kitaj, they have prized his company. When with them, he had a rare gift for the unexpected push in the right direction. We know from the late Thomas B. Hess, whose essay of 1978 is reprinted in the catalogue, that as an exile in New York during World War II, Fernand Leger was delighted to be introduced by Professor Schapiro to the ''Beatus Apocalypse'' in the Morgan Library, with its ''background shapes of intense color bounded by crisp edges'' that Leger soon adapted to his own uses. And it was he, in 1952, who was able to persuade Willem de Kooning that ''Woman I'' was not a failure, as de Kooning had supposed, but a success from which other successes were sure to come.

Given a record of this kind, and given the diffidence with which Professor Schapiro regards his own activity as an artist, it should surprise no one that the works in his show -most of them small - are gentle and ruminative in character, and touch on a whole gamut of idioms. (There is even a study after a drawing by Seurat that would deceive many a layman. Matisse is there, too, in a drawing of Mrs. Schapiro done in 1932.) There are landscape studies (note the tall clouded sky in ''Glebe Mountain'') and cityscapes (note the deft placement and the beauty of tone in ''Riverside Park, New York, Near the West 80's''). Family subjects play a large part in the show, and often bring out a freedom of color and a lightness of touch that speak for the pleasure with which they were done. And as Professor Schapiro has always been hypersensitive to political developments, it is natural that before and during World War II there are imaginative subjects (''Furious Monsters,'' for one, and ''Apocalypse Over Manhattan'' for another, not to mention ''War'' and ''War and Peace'') that touch on the terrors of the day.

There are some very good later portraits, and there are abstractions that have both weight and resolution. But then, nothing that comes from Meyer Schapiro's hand - whether written, drawn or painted - can leave us indifferent. The show is open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 1 to 5 P.M., through May 23, and it is best reached from the university entrance at Broadway and 116th Street.

From the moment in 1946 when his work was first presented by the Pierre Matisse Gallery, New York has never been short of Dubuffet exhibitions. Readers may wonder, therefore, why we should need yet another large retrospective - spread, this time, over two galleries, with the earlier work at Wildenstein's and the later work at the Pace Gallery. Shouldn't he be given a rest? How many more of those relentless jigsaws do we have to decipher?
