The first major strike in the steel industry in 18 years closed iron ore mines and processing plants yesterday across northern Minnesota and Michigan, the heart of the ore country.

Some 16,000 to 17,000 workers were idled in the walkouts by the United Steelworkers of America, which tied up about 85 percent of the nation's domestic iron ore output.

The strikes do not immediately threaten steel production because a four‐month supply of ore and pellets had been stockpiled. They may, however, threaten the efficacy of the Experimental Negotiating Agreement between the industry and the union.

Industry‐Wide Strikes Forbidden

Industrywide strikes are forbidden under this agreement. But strikes on mine‐or plant‐level problems, so‐called local issues, are allowed. The union insists that the strikes are over such local issues. Linus Wampler the union's district director in Duluth, Minn., cites 1,250 complaints at 21 striking locals “that have festered for years,” involving such things as job assignments and seniority.
