THE effort to establish the striped bass as a game fish in New York State has once again failed.

Don Jordan, an official of Save Our Stripers, Inc., of Massapequa Park, L. I., the organization that led the highly publicized campaign to make the striper off limits to commercial fishermen, says that the so‐called “compro mise” legislation that was passed late last month is an “insult to the sport fishing and conservation public.”

The legislation bans striper netting in the Hudson River from the village of Croton‐on Hudson to the village of Cox sackie in Greene County, from Dec. 1 to March 15, but Jordan observes that netting is almost always impossible along that stretch during the period mentioned because of ice. The bill also bans haul seining from Shagwong Reef around Montauk Point to Dutch Plains. This is more of the same, says Jordan, be cause the rocky bottom in the area has always made haul seining impractical there.

Save Our Stripers is call ing upon members and sup porters to ask Governor Rockefeller to refuse to sign the bill into law. If it is signed by the Governor, it will go into effect July 1 of this year.

The bill also establishes a $100 yearly license fee for those who would sell the stripers they catch. This ap plies to rod‐and‐reel fisher men as well as outright com mercial fishermen.
