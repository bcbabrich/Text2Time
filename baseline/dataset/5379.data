Inquiries into the bribery allegations were under way by the United States Attorney in Brooklyn, Andrew J. Maloney; the city's Commissioner of Investigation, Kenneth Conboy, and by the Fire Department Inspector General, Jonathan Fairbanks.

The investigators declined to comment on the matter yesterday, but they were said to be looking into all of the work handled in recent years by the inspectors named in the allegations, and into all Fire Department documentation pertaining to the renovation work at Port Mobil, which began in 1979. Port Mobil is across the Arthur Kill from Perth Amboy, N.J.

Questions about that work arose Thursday and Friday in testimony at a Federal tax-evasion trial in Brooklyn by a Bronx piping contractor who said he had paid thousands of dollars in bribes to five fire officials to expedite inspections and avoid costly delays. 'Way of Doing Business'

The contractor, Robert Matthews, manager of the Matthews Industrial Piping Company of the Bronx, who testified under a grant of immunity, said he paid $126,000 in bribes from 1979 and 1983 to the Bureau of Fire Prevention's chief civilian inspector, Milton Fishkin, who retired in 1984.

Mr. Matthews also said he had paid unspecified bribes to the deputy chief inspector of the bureau's bulk oil unit, Richard Docyk, and $100 each to three inspectors whom he did not identify. Pending the outcome of the investigations, Mr. Docyk was relieved of his duties Friday and placed in a ''nonsensitive position,'' officials said. Testifying at the trial of an executive of a Staten Island excavating company, Mr. Matthews said he had paid $1,000 a month to Mr. Fishkin from 1979 to 1982, and $5,000 a month to him in 1982 and 1983 when his company was working at Port Mobil.
