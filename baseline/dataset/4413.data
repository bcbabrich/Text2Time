By rejecting insistent Bosnian demands today that the United Nations either send soldiers to defend Sarajevo or let the Muslims there buy arms freely to do the job themselves, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has upped the stakes for his organization in its efforts to resolve the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Throughout a long and difficult day of constant heckling by Sarajevo's residents, the Secretary General insisted over and over again that the only way forward was through negotiation and dialogue, not guns and fighting, and that the omens were good.

"I believe 1993 will be the year of peace for Bosnia," he said repeatedly. Power Seems to Be Slipping

A success would clearly raise his own prestige hugely, along with that of the United Nations. But it is equally clear that another failure would deliver a serious blow to the organization's reputation as a peacemaker at a time when, after a string of early post-cold-war successes, its powers seem to be slipping in several parts of the world.
