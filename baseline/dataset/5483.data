The Postal Service finished the fiscal year 1987 with a loss of more than $200 million, emphasizing the need for the higher rates expected to take effect next spring, Postmaster General Preston R. Tisch said today.

While the final accounting has not been completed, preliminary results indicate that the Postal Service losses will range from $200 million to $225 million, Mr. Tisch said at a National Press Club breakfast. The agency completed its fiscal year last Saturday.

The Postmaster General added that, while he would continue to urge postal managers to hold spending down, he expected the agency's losses to reach $400 million in the current fiscal year.

Anticipating those losses, the Postal Service earlier this year filed for higher rates, which would raise the cost of a first-class stamp from 22 cents to 25 cents. Increase Likely in April
