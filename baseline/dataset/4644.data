The Aluminum Company of America said yesterday that it was eliminating 2,100 jobs to trim operations and increase efficiency at 21 of its worldwide business divisions.

The nation's largest aluminum producer will take a second-quarter after-tax charge of $40.6 million for severance payments. In the year-earlier second period, Alcoa earned $81.2 million, or 95 cents a share, on sales of $2.57 billion.

"We're not responding to a downturn in orders or the business cycle," said a spokesman for the Pittsburgh-based company. "We're doing this to be more efficient. It is not a response to the market." Sagging Prices, Lagging Profits

Investors responded enthusiastically to the news. On the New York Stock Exchange, Alcoa shares rose $1 to $75.875 yesterday.
