"Where's Gary?" said S. M., Pavement's lead singer and guitarist, about two-thirds of the way through the band's set at Maxwell's on Tuesday night, the first of two sold-out evenings. He looked around rather distractedly. Gary, the drummer, was nowhere to be seen. No one in the band seemed to know where he had gone or when he had left. Only mildly daunted, S. M. nosed around the stage for a minute or two, and the band attempted to go into an acoustic song. They had trouble getting it off the ground -- someone kept messing up, and S. M. was starting to laugh -- but eventually they shuffled through. The bassist, perhaps bored, sat down on the drum stool and watched.

Half rock-and-roll, half circus of the absurd and all attitude, Pavement's show set a new standard for lackadaisical cool on the underground rock scene (their unorthodox nomenclature is part of the mystique). The band's music draws on a conventional set of pre- and post-punk influences: Sonic Youth's calculated guitar noise and half-spoken vocals, the Velvet Underground's thudding rhythms, Dinosaur Jr.'s way of strangling a pop hook. When Pavement put a little effort into its performance, its ingenuity was easily apparent. S. M. would push his voice into a derelict falsetto, singing along with Spiral Stairs's primitive guitar lead and rolling his eyes; a second drummer flailed away on a heavy tom, hitting slightly behind the beat and giving the rhythms a jagged, 3-D quality.

Most of the time, though, Pavement acted as if it just didn't care. Back in the 80's, bands like the Replacements made a statement out of sloppiness, putting on shows in which songs would go half-finished, band members would change instruments and venerable rock gods like Led Zeppelin would be felled in drunken versions of their most famous songs. But where the Replacements were making a stand against the corpulence and conformity of mainstream rock, Pavement is making a stand against making a stand. In the 90's, no icons remain to be toppled (except maybe Nirvana, whom S. M. cheerfully ridiculed). Pavement takes nothing seriously; antiprofessionalism is as much a joke as professionalism.

Interestingly enough, the attitude provided some good entertainment. What S. M. didn't seem to know when he asked "Where's Gary?" was that the drummer had already had a minor altercation. During "Here," a song from the band's debut album, "Slanted and Enchanted," he was wailing away happily, tossing sticks in the air between each beat. Then he apparently broke a piece of equipment. Gary got up from behind his kit, stuck a cigarette in his mouth and began to walk offstage. Spiral Stairs stopped him, turned him around and pushed him back toward his seat. After that, Gary must have been looking for an opening, a moment when no one was paying attention and he could sneak offstage.
