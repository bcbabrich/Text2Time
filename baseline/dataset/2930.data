The measure, which Mr. Hatch said he would co-sponsor, calls for a 10-year jail term and $1 million fine for anyone who tries to clone a child, either by implanting a cloned embryo into a woman's womb or into an artificial womb. It would require cloning research experiments to be approved by hospital or university ethics committees.

Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who is the bill's lead sponsor, said she hoped the legislation would ''bring out a broad consensus.'' But research opponents immediately denounced it.

''Under this bill, what President Bush called embryo farms will spring up and flourish,'' said Douglas Johnson, spokesman for the National Right to Life Committee.

The opponents had few kind words for Mr. Hatch, who justified his support for the research by saying that life begins in a woman's womb, ''not in a petri dish.'' Kenneth L. Connor, president of the conservative Family Research Council, called that argument ''empty sophistry.''

But Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and another co-sponsor of the Feinstein bill, praised Mr. Hatch as taking a politically difficult stand. Mr. Kennedy said Mr. Hatch's support ''proves once again that support for patients knows no party lines.''

Discussions of morality in science have percolated in the capital for nearly a year and were in evidence again today, as Elias A. Zerhouni, the Bush administration's nominee to direct the National Institutes of Health, appeared before the Senate health committee for his confirmation hearing. Mr. Kennedy, the committee chairman, said he expected that Dr. Zerhouni would be confirmed by the full Senate by the end of the week.

During the hearing, Dr. Zerhouni carefully avoided offering his personal views on stem cell research or cloning. The senators, led by Mr. Kennedy, did not push him. Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, did ask him, though, if he would press President Bush to revisit his policy about limiting federal financing for embryonic stem cell research should it become apparent that more studies were needed.
