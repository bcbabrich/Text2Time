The Brooklyn Philharmonic and the Next Wave Festival joined forces over the weekend to present three concerts of a program of determinedly post-modernist European orchestral music in the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Opera House. Each score was a major effort, lasting between 25 and 33 minutes. There was one post-modernist ''greatest hit'' and three premieres, and it was the hit that proved the highlight of Friday evening's performance.

Arvo Part, the Estonian composer who now lives in West Berlin, is one of several composers (among them Alfred Schnittke and Sofiya Gubaidulina) who have received the partisanship of Gidon Kremer, the Soviet violinist who also now lives in the West. Mr. Part's score ''Tabula Rasa'' has won particular praise for its religio-mystical, Eastern European gloss on Minimalist precepts. The means are simple but the ends are profound.

Just how Mr. Part achieves this profundity, compared to simple-minded imitations that use similar tactics to far lesser effect, is a quandary. With busy, complex scores, one can avoid the issue of artistic worth by dwelling on the complexities. With Minimalism, one is forced to fall back on essentials.

''Tabula Rasa,'' which lasted 27 minutes, is in two movements, scored for two solo violinists (Mr. Kremer and Tatyana Grindenko), strings and prepared piano, which acts like a distant percussion battery. In the first movement, the strings establish a slow, restful pulse, like a heartbeat, and the violinists weave ethereal traceries in upper positions and harmonics. In the second movement, it is the soloists who delineate the pulse, punctuated by more varied string textures and a periodic effect that sounds like a distant, tolling bell. The result is either restful (there were several peaceful sleepers in my immediate proximity) or consoling; I stayed awake, and was consoled.
