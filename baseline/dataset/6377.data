To THE EDITOR:

I READ with increasing distaste Hilton Kramer's account (April 14) of the exhibit of 19th‐century. American art in the Metro politan Museum, put together to celebrate the centenary of that institution. One of the primary purposes of a mu seum is to collect, organize and interpret important cul‐ tures of other lands and other times. Mr. Kramer's ex traordinary provincialism is such that he would not per mit this museum or any other to collect, organize and interpret any art except that of his own day.

Mr. Kramer replies:

I am afraid that Professor Jones has completely misread my article on the Met's “19th‐Century America” ex hibition. Nowhere have I sug gested that the Met should confine its collections or ex hibitions to the art of our own day. Indeed, more at tentive readers of my articles on the Met will be aware that, if anything, I have voiced grave misgivings about the museum's decision to lavish its resources on the collection and exhibition of contemporary art.

In my review of “19th‐Cen tury America,” I made two principal points: (1) that in the selection of the decora tive arts the museum chose to dwell exclusively on the pretentious, second‐hand tastes of the upper middle class while totally ignoring the genius of American folk expression; and (2) that the paintings in the exhibition were not selected on the basis of esthetic merit. To neither of these points does Professor Jones address him self.

“FICTION”

To THE EDITOR:

Hilton Kramer is to be congratulated for his evalu ation of the Metropolitan's “19th‐Century America.” One Wishes that The Times's his tory editor would also say something about Leutze's Washington. The truth is that Washington crossed the Delaware by ferry and not in a Durham boat. To have him stand up in a boat and pose for a picture while the sailors are sweating to keep the boat afloat in choppy waters is an insult to the father of our country. The least the Met could do is to make it quite clear that the portrait is pure fiction and a denial of history.
