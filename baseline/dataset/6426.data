Atter its sharp decline on Thursday, the world sugar futures market regained a little equlibrium yesterday. Trading slowed from a near record 6,344 contracts to 1,400 contracts.

The sharp drop on Thursday followed reliable reports of better than expected supply situation. Yesterday, at the opening of trading, there was some further liquidation of sugar contracts by speculators, probably due to some margin calls after Thursday's debacle.

As one broker commented, the selling may have been overdone because trade buying entered to steady the market and push prices ahead for the day.

The busy September delivery, which declined from 3.83 cents a pound to 3.70 cents on Thursday, pushed ahead to close at a range of 3.74 cents to 3.75 cents yesterday. The world spot price remained unchanged yesterday at 3.75 cents.
