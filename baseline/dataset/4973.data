To the Editor:

Was Franz Werfel baptized into the Roman Catholic Church after his death? The Rev. E. J. Mattimoe writes that he couldn't have been and implies that only your reviewer, John Simon, thinks he was (Letters, June 10). But Peter Stephan Jungk's biography states that he was and declares that Alma Mahler Werfel was lying when she denied it. We have to conclude that a ceremony was performed, even though Father Mattimoe says it was invalid. What was the disposition of Werfel's soul after this event, which may have been an improper event? We shall have to wait awhile for the answer to that one.
