The sales tax in Suffolk County will increase a quarter of a percentage point Saturday, from 7.25 percent to 7.5 percent.

As a result, an extra penny of tax will be added to every $4 worth of goods or services purchased in the county.

The increase was approved by the County Legislature in September to help bail out the Southwest Sewer District and to avoid a doubling of sewer taxes for Islip and Babylon residents who live in the district.

William Brotherton, the deputy county executive in charge of finance, said that most of the tax increase would be spent in the sewer district for the first two years. But he said that over the five-year life of the tax increase, nearly 40 percent of the $115 million he expects it to yield would be spent in other sewer districts to lower tax rates.
