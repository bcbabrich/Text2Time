I-20 Gallery

529 West 20th Street

Chelsea

Through Aug. 9

Like many of his generation, Todd Knopke (b. 1973) brings to the table a cheerfully inconsistent, antiheroic sensibility. His exhibition looks like a show of a half-dozen different artists, most into some variation of Neo-Pop primitivism.

It includes a huge quilt emblazoned with the words ''Come On, Sing Out, Everything's Not Lost''; a life-size sculpture of the artist as a professional wrestler; a painting of two people communing through crystals held to their foreheads; photographs of mosh pits; a wooden sculpture of a guitar amplifier and microphone painted flat black; and a crude, life-size sculpture of five white, life-size wolves sitting in a tree based on a psychoanalytic patient's dream famously written about by Freud.

All of this is more or less amusing and might be taken seriously as a meditation on wishful contemporary narcissism. But except for the wolf sculpture, a genuinely striking image, nothing else in the show is as compelling as a miniature closet built into the gallery wall at floor level.

The door is an 18-inch-tall bookcase filled with tiny volumes, and it hinges open to reveal an electrically lighted interior with wire coat hangers, a polished hardwood floor and a revolving disco ball.
