"I bought it in a large amount initially expecting it to sell because the Elton John single is already out," said Lal Sarju, the store's soundtrack buyer, referring to "Can You Feel the Love Tonight." "But when the movie comes out, I expect to sell a couple hundred pieces a week."

Buyers at record and toy stores agree sales of the soundtrack will probably be sluggish until the movie opens, but they're hoping airplay and the pre-release hype will help. "There's already been a lot of anticipation," Lew Garrett, the vice president of purchasing for the 430-store chain Camelot Music, said. "I think it has the potential to be one of the biggest hits of the summer. We certainly bought it that way." Beastie Boys With Monks

The Beastie Boys were the last band anyone expected to get political. The hip-hop trio's first full-length album, "Licensed to Ill" in 1986, was a boy's night out, crammed with tales of drinking and partying. Their most recent album, "Ill Communication" (Grand Royal/Capitol), released yesterday, sounds more like the morning after. It's sleepy and sprawling, heavy and reflective. "The earth needs to be respected," Adam Yauch (a k a MCA) raps on "The Update." "It's been far too long that she's been neglected."

On Friday night at the Academy, the Beastie Boys -- Michael Diamond (Mike D), Adam Horovitz (King Adrock) and Mr. Yauch -- put their money where their mouths are. The surprise performance, announced the day of the show, was a benefit for Artists for Tibet, a national campaign to preserve Tibetan culture. Also on the bill were Luscious Jackson, a female punk, funk and hip-hop quartet that includes the former Beastie Boys drummer, Kate Schellenbach, and the Tibetan Ganden Jangtse Monks.

"I don't think most of our audience has ever seen something like the monks," Mr. Yauch, 29, said from his parents' home in Brooklyn hours before the show, "and I definitely don't think the monks have ever seen the kind of insanity that goes on at our concerts before. Hopefully it will run smoothly. The main thing we're hoping to do with the concert is bring about some more awareness about what's happening in Tibet, especially among younger people."
