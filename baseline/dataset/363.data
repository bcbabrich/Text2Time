To the Editor:

Re “Don’t Drug Test Poor People” (Op-Ed, June 28):

I agree with Jamila Michener and Julilly Kohler-Hausmann that poor people shouldn’t be selected for drug testing to qualify for Medicaid or other assistance. The only way it would be fair to test them is if we test everyone who benefits from government aid or subsidy.

This would include people who receive a subsidy on their federal income tax by claiming the mortgage interest deduction; or people who have a tax-advantaged, employer-provided health insurance policy; or people who receive a break on taxes by claiming charitable deductions.

I could go on.
