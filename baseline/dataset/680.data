WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — This offering from Kevin Christian and Brad Wilber rocked me out of my midweek blahs. In my view, it’s a sassy, bluesy grid that was a lot of fun to solve. This puzzle is the solving equivalent of sipping your third Scotch in a dark blues club after midnight. All you know is that you’re having a good time and the band is playing all your favorites.

Maybe I liked the disparity between the operatic theme and the sizzling, hip, clean fill. NORSE GODS are stuck inside the four excellent theme entries: TYR is inside PANTY RAID, ODIN inside MOOD INDIGO, THOR inside TRUTH OR DARE and LOKI inside HELLO KITTY.

But then: We’ve got BOSSMAN and we’ve got our drums on a RISER, which I somehow knew. We’ve got the trendy ANIME and HELLO KITTY. Our MOOD is INDIGO. TRUTH OR DARE is probably clued the way it is so that more people will recognize it at this point in the week, rather than as Madonna’s tour documentary, but that’s O.K. We’ll take an entry like that any way we can get it, because it throws off sparks as you move your hand or cursor across the grid. The late ELMORE Leonard, the coolest of the cool, snapping his fingers in the corner.

And we’ve got some delicious wordplay in “Hit bottom?” for SPANK and “Cover of knight?” for ARMOR.

I’m frankly surprised they’re not charging a SIN TAX for this one.

Not sure of some of the entries here? TELL MAMA and I’ll help you out.

Constructors’ Notes:

Brad Wilber: Kevin and I met at A.C.P.T. in 2013 and and we thought it would be fun to work on a couple of midweek puzzles together. He had a big notebook of theme ideas and he sent me sort of a buffet of selections. This is the one I chose. He had a group of theme entries that required no tweaking and were all familiar phrases with some panache.He had a nice start on the fill, as well. One of my suggestions was to add two white squares to the center to reduce the count of three-letter words, and the seven-letter words slid neatly and painlessly in. We discussed just about every corner of the puzzle together, so even if it took a bit longer than average to finish, it was fun to go over so many fill options.

It won’t be easy to do because this was a good one, but free your mind and move yourself on to the Thursday puzzle:
