SAN FRANCISCO — The success of Matt Harvey in his first two major leagues starts has some wondering whether Zack Wheeler, the Mets’ other coveted pitching prospect, might also make an appearance in the big leagues this year.

But Manager Terry Collins said that it seemed an unlikely outcome for Wheeler, who was only just promoted to Class AAA on Wednesday afternoon.

“I’m anxious to see Zack Wheeler pitch,” Collins said. “Will it be this year? I would doubt it.”

Wheeler has gone 10-6 with a 3.26 earned run average and 117 strikeouts in 19 Class AA starts this year.

Collins said the decision was General Manager Sandy Alderson’s to make. But he speculated that the high number of innings Wheeler would pitch by the time September comes would preclude him from a call-up. Wheeler has pitched 116 innings already.

“I’m sure there’s a lot of that being talked about in the organization,” Collins said. “This guy’s already at more innings than he’s thrown in the past. I’d be surprised if we see him in September.”

Collins has not seen Wheeler pitch since spring training. But he has been hearing positive reports on him.

“Everybody’s raving about his stuff,” Collins said. “It’s the same thing with all young pitchers. He’s got to command it.”
