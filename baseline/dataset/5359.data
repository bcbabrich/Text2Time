Mr. Salinas will be sworn in at the Mexican Congress, where in August and September enraged opposition legislators sought to prevent his certification as the country's President-elect. After nearly a month of heated debates and occasional fistfights, however, Mr. Salinas's victory in the July 6 balloting, with a bare majority of 50.7 percent of the vote, was made official.

Opposition parties of the right and left continue to maintain that they were deprived of millions of votes and that Mr. Salinas is coming to office illegitimately. But negotiations aimed at preventing incidents during the inauguration ceremonies ended with both opposition blocs being permitted to state their positions before Mr. Salinas enters the legislative chamber.

New doubts about Mr. Salinas's commitment to political change were raised this afternoon when Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, Governor of the state of Veracruz, was named Secretary of the Interior. That post, whose responsibilities include supervision of the state police and security apparatus, is the most politically influential and sensitive in the Cabinet. Mr. Gutierrez Barrios, 61, headed the federal police in 1968 when army and security forces fired on student protestors here, killing more than 250 people, and he continues to be regarded as a hard-liner with no particular devotion to civil liberties. Minister Stays in Cabinet

In a break with tradition, Mr. Salinas retained Manuel Bartlett Diaz, the current Interior Minister and his chief rival last year for the ruling party's presidential nomination, in the Cabinet, this time as Education Minister. Opposition leaders accused Mr. Bartlett of engineering the electoral fraud they say took place in July, and the choice is likely to be as controversial as that of Mr. Guitierrez Barrios.

As Foreign Minister, Mr. Salinas chose Fernando Solana, who is currently director of the Banco Nacional de Mexico and who has served previously as both Education and Commerce Ministers. Though the post of ambassador to Washington is not yet filled, advisers to Mr. Salinas said the choice of Gustavo Petricioli, the current Finance Minister, was probable.
