The freshman wide receiver Josh Jarboe was dismissed Friday from the Oklahoma football team, just three days after a crude Internet video surfaced that showed him freestyle rapping about guns, shooting people and having sex.

The Tulsa World first reported Jarboe’s dismissal after his Friday morning meeting with Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops.

“We are disappointed in this outcome, but our complete review and the final decision is in the best interest of the program,” Stoops said in a statement. “We outlined for Josh the expectations we had for him when he arrived and, unfortunately, those expectations have not been met. Josh needs to learn from this experience. We hope he can move forward in a positive manner.”

The 74-second video of Jarboe rapping was posted Tuesday on the Oklahoma fan site Reddirtkings.com after previously showing up on YouTube. In May, the 6-foot-3, 195-pound Jarboe pleaded guilty to bringing a gun to Ellenwood (Ga.) Cedar Grove High School and carrying a pistol without a license. The charges were originally felonies, but they were reduced to misdemeanors.

Jarboe, who was rated among the Class of 2008’s top 10 wide receivers by Rivals.com, was sentenced to two years of probation and 80 hours of community service, but was still allowed to enroll at Oklahoma. He signed with the Sooners in February and was arrested the next month.

The timing of Jarboe’s dismissal is interesting because Stoops told The Oklahoman columnist Berry Tramel on Thursday that he wouldn’t kick Jarboe off the team for his video.

“We’re starting to talk about everything kids say and do,” Stoops told Tramel. “Now we’re in people’s homes, in their private spaces.”

Despite Stoops’s initial reticence to dismiss him, someone apparently didn’t want an encore from Jarboe.
