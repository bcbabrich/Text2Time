Federal prosecutors have offered a new plea deal to John A. Gotti, the accused acting boss of the Gambino crime family, including a shorter prison sentence than the six-and-a-half-to-eight-year term that Mr. Gotti rejected in late December.

Word that plea negotiations had been re-opened between the prosecutors and Mr. Gotti's defense team came after two apparent setbacks to the prosecution's racketeering case against Mr. Gotti, 34, who is the son of John J. Gotti, the imprisoned Mafia leader.

On Friday, a special assistant United States Attorney, Vincent Heintz, was dismissed from the Gotti case for violating an order not to speak with reporters, although it was unclear exactly what information he had disclosed.

And on Saturday, a jury deliberating the case of two brothers charged with two killings in 1996 at Scores, the Upper East Side strip club, returned a partial verdict that suggested they were questioning the credibility of a prosecution witness, a Mafia turncoat who is also expected to testify against Mr. Gotti.
