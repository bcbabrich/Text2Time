Mapplethorpe often said that he was "looking for perfection in form." A classicizing sensibility is at work in his idealization of and nearly exclusive focus on the human form and in his penchant for sharp definition, immaculate surfaces and Minimalist compositions. Meanwhile, the strangeness of his poses and unnaturally chiseled musculature of his models, not to mention the steady undercurrent of raw or lightly cooked sex, contributes to a combination of theatricality, distortion and bravura associated with Mannerism. The standard definition of Mannerism as exaggerated Classicism fits Mapplethorpe, at least up to a point. In addition, he approached photography with the goal of creating an intensely sculptural effect, which fits nicely with Mannerist prints, especially those of Goltzius, that depict antique sculptures.

You could have asked for a slightly more relevant catalog. Mr. Ippolitov writes as if postmodernism never happened. Jennifer Blessing, a Guggenheim project curator, has interesting things to say about allegory in contemporary art. For some reason, Mr. Celant devotes a lot of space to a discussion of Mapplethorpe and Rodin. There is little discussion of how the photographs relate to the prints.

That is left to the viewer, and the good news is that the show's exquisite installation makes all kinds of points, some formal, some funny, some profound. (Print lovers may want to take binoculars as well as magnifying glasses: a third of the show is installed in sloping bays that make close looking impossible.) As the cavalcade of bodies unfurls up the ramp, the 400-year-old prints look amazingly fresh. We see anew how the adoration of the human body -- the miracle of nature that we all know best -- is one of art's prime movers.

Two highlights are Goltzius's astounding engravings of the "Farnese Hercules," a depiction of Willem van Tetrode's sculptural copy of a celebrated sculpture unearthed in Rome in the 1540's. In the best, a rear view, Hercules' body is defined by incredibly fine crisscrossing grids that fan out across the rippling flesh of his shoulders, buttocks, thighs and calves.

The image is voluptuous to the point of excess -- Hercules in a black-net body stocking -- and mathematically precise, like a Sol LeWitt wall drawing made with a compass. The play of flesh and geometry articulates the atmosphere of precision and concentration that is also at work in Mapplethorpe's most powerful images. Next comes an equally muscular but female body seen from the front. It is a Mapplethorpe of the bodybuilder Lisa Lyon, from the neck down. (One of Mapplethorpe's idealizing techniques was to leave most models' heads out of the picture.) And after that, his photograph of Derrick Cross's torso, from the back, echoes the Hercules image, bulging with muscles. It would also have evened out the Goltzius pair to have placed nearby the dauntingly beautiful close-up of Mr. Cross's rock-solid torso from the front, which has an almost Egyptian flatness to it. But it also makes sense to place it halfway up the ramp beside Goltzius's more restrained image of the Apollo Belvedere, another antique sculpture.

A more genuine missed opportunity occurs with Mapplethorpe's "Alan Lyne" of 1979, which shows a demonic-looking nude young man, his head abristle with braids, who rears back on one leg as he takes control of a long coil of rope that is as weirdly recalcitrant as his hair. It would have been great to see it beside Jacob Matham's foot-stomping engraving "Apollo in the Clouds," an energized, almost facetious homage to the avenging Christ of Michelangelo's "Last Judgment." Otherwise, the show doesn't miss much. Jan Harmensz. Muller's "Cain Killing Abel" is beside the S-and-M double portrait "Dominick and Elliot"; both images center on two bodies in sharply different positions. Mapplethorpe's trio of two male and one female nude hangs next to Matham's "Graces."
