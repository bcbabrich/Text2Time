Mikhail S. Gorbachev's four-day visit to New Delhi, which ended Friday, was widely seen to have strengthened India's friendship with the Soviet Union. But there was no evidence that the two countries had advanced their military ties or lessened New Delhi's determination to look to the West for help in developing high-technology weapons systems.

Senior Indian officials said military questions had been peripheral to the nearly 10 hours of talks between Mr. Gorbachev and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and that such matters had been discussed more in the months leading up to the visit, particularly during a recent trip to Moscow by the Indian Defense Minister, Arun Singh.

''We asked for no arms deals and got none,'' said an Indian diplomat. ''Seeking those kinds of agreements is just not our style.''

Reassurances and Demurrals

Indian officials said the talks were important because of their focus on what India perceives as its security threat from China and Pakistan. Although no new Indian-Soviet security accords were said to have been signed or agreed to, Indian officials said they felt reassured.
