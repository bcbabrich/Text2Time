Finally, college officials say, anything that competes with binge drinking, the current plague of college campuses, should be encouraged.

''I see it as a kind of continuation of kids' soccer leagues, increasingly structured social interaction,'' said Craig W. Bradley, dean of student affairs at Bowdoin College in Maine, which is also experiencing a surge in ballroom and swing dancing.

''During the first year in college it is so important to feel like you belong, have a group,'' Mr. Bradley said. ''If it isn't happening, drinking fills that void. The conventions around dating fell away in recent decades. I have students come in and say they want intimate relations but don't know how to get there. Ballroom dancing is one answer.''

The trend also seems to be a middle-class revenge against the formlessness of popular dance that began in the early 1960's when Chubby Checker's twist sent partner dancing packing. Dancing, for milleniums a form of social glue, deteriorated in the 1960's into group chaos against a background of loud, pulsating rhythms and nervous two-step hugging to slower songs.

As Laura Kelso, an 18-year-old Penn State freshman from Greensburg, Pa., put it in describing her interest in the new swing dance club here, ''Dancing in high school was either flailing around or slow dances without steps. People need some kind of structure, some form of socialization.''

In the Penn State ballroom dance classes, held in several large gymnasiums with pale green walls, exposed pipes and worn wooden floors, that is precisely what may be observed. There are no smart-alecks here, said Elizabeth A. Hanley, the teacher with nearly four decades of experience. Here are tomorrow's stalwarts in all forms, the smoothly decorous, the knobby-jointed and the floppy-footed, content to be addressed as ''ladies and gentlemen.''

''It is always good to know how to dance,'' said Jeffrey Ellis, a rangy 22-year-old from Pittsburgh just finishing an accounting degree.
