WASHINGTON, June 2—Menahem Begin has sent a representative to the United States in an effort to ease apprehension among Americans about the likely emergence of his right‐wing Likud bloc as the head of the next Israeli government.

The representative, Schmuel Katz, met with a group of reporters today to counteract what he called “distortion” in the American press about Mr. Begin, the longtime Likud leader who is likely to be the next Prime Minister.

Essentially, Mr. Katz sought to soften the hard‐line image of Mr. Begin and the Likud, particularly the impression created largely by Mr. Begin's own comments, before the Israeli elections last month and immediately afterward. This was that a government led by the Likud leader would refuse to negotiate Israeli withdrawal from all or part of the West Bank of the Jordan and the Gaza Strip, thereby rendering American peace efforts ineffective.

Begin Said to Accept U.N. Resolution

Mr. Katz said that Mr. Begin would accept Resolution 242 of the United Nations Security Council in “all its parts” and would attend any negotiations with Arab leaders “without prior conditions.” As part of their campaign, Likud leaders stressed their view that the Gaza Strip and the West Bank of the Jordan, both captured by Israel in the 1967 war, were actually subject to Israeli sovereignty.
