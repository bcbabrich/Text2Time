CAIRO — At least four protesters were shot dead in Sudan on Thursday, according to members of the country’s main protest movement. The killings took place during another round of large-scale demonstrations, potentially escalating a tense, monthslong standoff between protesters and military leaders.

The shootings came just three days after paramilitary forces fired on demonstrators, killing five teenagers and an adult.

Thousands had taken to the streets in the capital, Khartoum, and in cities across Sudan on Thursday to demand justice for the killings earlier this week, in the south-central city of El-Obeid.

“The protests today were a message on El-Obeid — that we are one and that each life matters,” said Nadreen Rugheem, a physician who protested in Khartoum.
