Watching the New York City Opera's current production of ''La Traviata'' on Saturday evening at the New York State Theater, I couldn't help wondering who the company imagines its audience to be. Directed by Frank Corsaro, the production is a superficially traditional look at the Verdi opera, with sets and costumes that are a mismatched, historic pastiche, and with blocking that is unlikely to awaken new insight into the characters for operagoers acquainted with the work. Newcomers, meanwhile, are liable to focus on the supertitles, which in this production provide only the sketchiest paraphrase of what is being sung.

But whatever its deficiencies, the production functions well enough as a singers' showcase, and the company used it as a vehicle for a few very fine voices. Marilyn Mims, the soprano who sang Violetta, was especially impressive. Her voice is large, nicely rounded and consistently pleasant throughout the range.

It is also remarkably supple, and since Verdi gives Violetta ample opportunity for rumination, both agitated and wistful, Ms. Mims is able to show off not only her high notes but also her ability to float a limpid, beautifully shaded pianissimo line. In her long soliloquy at the end of the first act (''E strano'' through ''Sempre libera''), and again in the last act's ''Addio del passato,'' she shaped her phrases thoughtfully and expressively, and used a rich array of vocal colors to excellent effect. Her acting is not yet as polished as her singing, but that may improve in time.

Stephen O'Mara's tenor is comparatively monochromatic, particularly toward the top, but he brought an ingenuous, vulnerable quality to his portrayal of Alfredo, and he went a long way to making up in his phrasing what he lacked in coloration.
