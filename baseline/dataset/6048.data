ALBANY, May 31—Governor Carey said today that he opposed efforts to require refundable deposits on bottles and cans, and indicated that he preferred instead a national “resource recovery” program that would collect discarded containers and find new industrial uses for the material.

Mr. Carey also said at his weekly news conference that a controversial letter from the state's Commerce Department urging legislators in Connecticut to vote against a bottle deposit bill there had his approval as “protective of New York.”

The Connecticut bill died a week ago after being blocked in a Senate committee on a parliamentary technicality. Had it passed, Mr. Carey said today, a “major segment” of New York's multimillion‐dollar canning and bottling industry could have been jeopardized.

There is also a bottle bill before the New York State Legislature. A major environmentalist goal for the past few years, it has never had much chance of passage here, and the Governor's remarks today appeared to remove whatever chance there was.
