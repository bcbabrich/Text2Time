It was not certain why Mr. Buscetta decided to do so, but the police speculated that he might have been seeking revenge on other crime leaders for murders of several of his relatives and chief lieutenants.

Mr. Buscetta tried to commit suicide after he was arrested in Rio de Janeiro on charges of having a false passport. He was extradited here on July 15 and has been held in two maximum security prisons.

The raids began early Saturday, and for several hours the police sealed off Palermo, the Sicilian capital. Officials said 3,000 police officers were involved in the operation. The arrests were concentrated in Palermo and Rome, but extended to other Italian cities.

As they were taken into police stations around the country this weekend, some of the accused smiled or laughed and nodded confidently to reporters. But others hung their heads or hid their faces from photographers. Premature News of Raids

The exact number of arrests was uncertain today, and the Italian police were reported to be upset that word of the raids was given to the press before they were completed. Officials said some of those named in the warrants might have escaped before the police arrived.

Late this afternoon, the Italian news agency ANSA reported that 58 people had been arrested, while other officials said the number had reached 69. Those arrested were taken to prisons around the country, mainly in the north, the police said.

Among the people picked up in the raids, according to the police, was Vito Ciancimino, the former Christian Democratic Mayor of Palermo.
