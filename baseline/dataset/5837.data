HALF MOON STREET: Two Short

Novels. By Paul Theroux. 219 pages.

Houghton Mifflin. $14.95. Lauren Slaughter is disappointed in London. As the protagonist of ''Doctor Slaughter,'' the longer of the two novellas in Paul Theroux's latest work of fiction, ''Half Moon Street,'' Lauren finds that London isn't London. ''She had not seen anything here that she had expected, and after a month she had seen too much that she had never expected,'' including the frozen toilet in her Brixton bedsitter, which a plumber repairs in exchange for Lauren's sexual favors.

Worse, despite her Ph.D., her knowledge of Chinese and her job as a Persian Gulf expert at the Hemisphere Institute of International Studies, Lauren is not a success. She is not one of the 5,000 that a man at an Institute dinner party identifies as the real population of the world. ''That's official,'' the man says. ''I am speaking of reality.'' ''Yes,'' says Lauren, ''in reality there are a billion people in China.'' ''Wrong,'' says the man. ''There are two people in China. I know both of them.''

So Lauren Slaughter takes a second job. After working hours at the Institute, she becomes an ''escort'' for the Jasmine Agency, which means that for a fee of a few hundred pounds she provides her ''companionship'' to various men for the evening. It's a long way from Culpeper, Va., where Lauren grew up. But at last she seems to have found a way of making it in London.

Gerald DeMarr, hero of ''Doctor DeMarr,'' the other novella in ''Half Moon Street,'' hates not London, nor even his hometown of Boston, where his story is set, but rather his twin brother, George, whom he sees as an ''ugly parody'' of himself. So when George shows up after years of silence, asking for ''a place to stay for a while,'' Gerald gives him a week and takes off for his cottage on the Cape.
