THIS is Melvin Belli's defense of Melvin Belli, who sees himself charged with losing one of the most celebrated murder cases of the 20th century —the trial of Jack Ruby for the shooting of President Kennedy's alleged assassin Lee Harvey Qswald. The book expresses the author's vengeance against the city in which the case was tried.

Mr. Belli would seem to have a safe and, in some circles, a popular, object of wrath. Since the 1930's Dallas has been a center of American reaction and political arrogance. This climate of conviction grew into active belligerence, creating incidents before the Kennedy tragedy involving, in 1960, Lyndon B. Johnson and his wife and, in 1963, Adlai Stevenson, U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations.

Mr. Belli calls Dallas a “city of shame.” He writes of “the Dallas sickness,” of “Dollar Dallas.” He says that “the surface sophistication of frontier Dallas could be summed up with what I had seen in one home, a philodendron growing in a goldplated bidet.” He implies that Dallas scorns Ruby because he is a Jew.

The Dallas condition is ascribed to “runaway materialism.” Such a distinction is hardly peculiar to Dallas. Mr. Belli's rage, his acrimony, shows him to be an incomparably graceless loser. Indeed, he says toward the end of the book that he “should have realized . . . that in just having spoken against Dallas as I had, I had pretty well killed my further usefulness to Jack in Texas. I would have fired me, too, had I been they,” meaning the Ruby family.
