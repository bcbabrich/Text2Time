And to Drink… Eric Asimov, the wine critic for The New York Times, suggests a drink pairing for one of the week’s recipes.

Pairing decisions are part analytical and, importantly, part emotional. Almost nothing will go better with this creamy, pungent, savory ramp omelet by David Tanis than those two amplifiers of umami, fino sherry and Champagne. That’s the rational choice, yet what I want most is gamay, the grape of Beaujolais. Why? Back in the old days, when being able to prepare a perfect omelet was considered evidence of cooking ability, my custom for my first meal on any trip to France was to stop in at a cafe or bar à vin for an omelet, with a glass of the easygoing house Beaujolais. For me, this combination was comfort and beauty. Nowadays, I might choose a gamay from the Loire Valley, or one of the few American versions, like Edmunds St. John’s, which I think come closer to those lighthearted yet compelling wines. The rational choice? Maybe not, but it sure felt like a great one.
