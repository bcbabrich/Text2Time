Councilwoman Inez E. Dickens said at a City Council hearing this afternoon that she does not support a rezoning plan that would transform 125th Street into a major commercial and business district. The proposal was approved last month by the City Planning Commission. Ms. Dickens’s position is crucial to the future of the rezoning because City Council members traditionally follow the lead of the council member who represents the district where a rezoning has been proposed.

Ms. Dickens, a Democrat, said that although she could not approve the rezoning, she would be willing to continue negotiating with the Planning Commission and other groups. She said she wants the plan to include more affordable housing; greater attention to health problems like asthma; expanding recreation programs in the area; and government aid to 71 businesses that would be displaced by the rezoning.



“Displacement, overdevelopment and gentrification are serious concerns,” Ms. Dickens said. “There will be no rezoning plan signed into law if I do not get the protection for my community.”

The rezoning encompasses 24 blocks of Harlem, stretching west from Broadway to Second Avenue, and between 124th and 126th Streets. It would include 2,000 new market-rate condominiums that neighborhood residents say they could not afford. Organizers have sought to use an obscure provision of the City Charter to increase the share of votes needed for the rezoning from a simple majority to three-quarters of the Council, but it is not clear that their effort will succeed.

But proponents say that the rezoning will create nearly 9,000 jobs and provide hundreds of units of affordable housing and lead to more restaurants and shops in the neighborhood.

Amanda M. Burden, the chairwoman of the Planning Commission, said at the hearing that the proposal had been “carefully crafted” during four and a half years of community meetings.

But Ms. Burden said she was willing to work with the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone and the city’s Economic Development Corporation to seek ways to aid the displaced businesses.

“It is very, very urgent,” she said of the rezoning plan.

The City Council has until the end of April to approve or reject it.
