SATURDAY PUZZLE — When last we saw Erin Rhode, she was making her debut almost exactly one year ago, with a wonderfully fun and lively Friday puzzle.

Ms. Rhode returns today and it makes me insanely happy to see a woman contributing strong themeless puzzles to the queue. Welcome back, Ms. Rhode.

I love the fact that the colloquialism I CAN’T EVEN makes its debut today, right beside PASS A TEST, which is hilarious if you read them together. In addition, FOOD COMA, AND I’M OUT, RED VINES and REPAYABLE make their debuts.

Tricky Clues

– 1A: For some reason, I conflated “postprandial” with “drunk out of one’s head,” and wrote in HANGOVER for the clue “Postprandial woe.” Just goes to show you. Postprandial means after one has eaten, and the answer is the very lively FOOD COMA.

– 43A: ENA was Bambi’s aunt in the Disney film.

– 49A: I love oyster crackers, even without the chowder, but that’s not what the clue was going for today. With the question mark at the end of the clue, we need to rethink the meaning of the word “crackers.” You know who cracks and eats oysters? OTTERS. Clever animals, those OTTERS. They open them with a rock. In fact, here’s one eating a clam:

– 64A: There are so many ways to show one’s feelings. You could send flowers, write a nice note. But if you’re going to display a small show of feelings, which is the key phrase here, you might use an EMOTICON.

– 5D: Roman numerals in puzzles. Devilish, especially when it’s clued vaguely, like “10th-century year.” So how do you solve it? Take heart in the fact that you already know that the first Roman numeral is going to be C because of the clue. Then solve 15- and 16A to get CMI, or 901.

– 11D: SAT flashback time! A pride is a group of lions and you are being asked for the collective name for toads. Pride : lions :: KNOT : toads.

– 35D: The clue “Old dope?” is not looking for the village idiot. The “old” in today’s clue, which is very clever, means that you are being asked for an old form of the word “dope.” Back in the day, people used the word RAD (short for “radical!”) to mean “dope.”

– 41D: When you’re working “blue,” you’re working with racy or dirty material. A “blue book” in today’s puzzle is not a test booklet, but SMUT.

Let’s hear all about the puzzle from Ms. Rhode herself:

Constructor’s Notes

I’m very excited to show off my second-ever New York Times crossword puzzle, just over one year from my first one. Perhaps I will make this an annual tradition. For all my friends and family who complained that my first puzzle ran on a Friday and they can never solve Fridays, well … now is your chance to tackle a Saturday instead! It has been pointed out to me that I am the first female constructor to write a Saturday puzzle since 2014. For those who are excited because a female constructor surely means fewer sports references … sorry. I was really excited when I got “AL East” in there as an atonement for including “ALers” last time, which I am well aware is a term that has been used in the real world by pretty much zero real baseball fans, of which I am very much one. A resident of Oakland, I had originally envisioned 32A to be an additional sports reference (my probably-too-hard clue: “Curry, for one”) and even when I submitted the puzzle back in October, assumed that it would be in reference to the 2016 N.B.A. Champions … but alas. It’s fine. Cleveland was due. And contrary to popular belief, my hometown of Minneapolis did *not* take over the longest professional sports championship drought; thank you very much, Minnesota Lynx. However, as much as I could ramble on about sports, none of the sports words were actually the seeds. FOOD COMA and BABY BUMP (which morphed into BABY MAMA when I decided that ESPNS was too much of a stretch, even though there seems to be 17 different ESPNs these days) were my first seeds in opposing corners. ALONE TIME (which would have been a debut at the time I submitted) and I CAN’T EVEN were the seeds in the other corners. At one point in the lower left, I had REPLY ALLS (as in “This e-mail thread has too many unnecessary reply-alls”) before deciding that, like ESPN, that wasn’t really a noun that should be pluralized. The less interesting — but more legit — REPAYABLE replaced it. After the seeds, I was pretty happy that the middle section gluing the four corners turned out some nice entries as well. I hadn’t attempted a grid quite this open in the middle before, and was delighted to get the aforementioned sports entries, as well as ROT GUT and PEN NAME to fall out. Finally, as I wrote the puzzle last fall, my clue for 46-across was obviously different. (I believe I referred to the Curious George authors.) But I’m pretty excited that Will went the Star Wars route here. Rey was my favorite of the new characters.

A very enjoyable Saturday outing, Ms. Rhode. Come back soon.
