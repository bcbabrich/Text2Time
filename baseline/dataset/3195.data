In ''Mysterious Object at Noon,'' the director Apichatpong Weerasethakul has devised a distinct kind of entertainment. Early on in this hybrid documentary, made in Thailand, a young woman who is not an actress relates a horrible incident. Her father, short of money to get home from a trip, sold her to her uncle. As she gets through the story, questioning her own worth, the off-camera director asks her a peculiar question: ''Now, do you have any other stories to tell us? It can be real or fiction.''

She wipes tears from her cheeks and mutters, ''What else can I tell you, real or fake?'' Is the filmmaker trying to distract her from her horrible tale, or does he have something wholly different in mind?

Whatever his agenda, Mr. Weerasethakul's odd request leads him across Thailand, where a cross section of people pick up the new story the girl invents and add their own details. The movie is like a combination of the gossip game and the old fable ''Stone Soup,'' in which suspicious villagers toss contributions into the pot of a wanderer to make a stew unlike any other; the wanderer's intent is to bring them all together. And that's the best way to describe what ''Mysterious Object'' will do for audiences. It's a film unlike any other, complete with a title that sounds like a remark that would result from a U.F.O. sighting.

The picture, which begins a run today at Anthology Film Archives, is shot in grainy black-and-white that sometimes seems to have pixels the size of pocket change. ''Mysterious Object,'' which is in Thai with English subtitles, is similar to the exercise in which assorted writers each contribute a sentence, or sometimes a chapter, to build a single story. By traveling through Thailand's countryside to encourage townspeople to spin the narrative, the film offers a beguiling look into the country.
