A case can be made that the craze for found-footage horror movies — see “Paranormal Activity,” Volumes 1-4 — began in Maryland. The real town of Burkittsville, in the western part of the state, was the setting of “The Blair Witch Project” back in 1999. “The Bay,” which takes place in a fictional Chesapeake Bay hamlet called Claridge, is something of a homecoming. It also represents an earnest if not entirely persuasive attempt to tease out some of the latent allegorical meanings of the genre, and to use fright to raise questions about the state of the environment.

The movie, directed by Barry Levinson from a script by Michael Wallach, is framed by a Skype interview with a Donna Thompson (Kether Donohue), a young woman recalling horrific events she witnessed as a student journalist on July 4, 2009. At the time, an opening sequence reminds us, the news was full of reports of the mysterious deaths of millions of birds and fish. To their numbers were added most of the human population of Claridge.

Clips of Donna’s news report are interspersed with the usual material that you encounter in movies like this: conference calls, cellphone grabs and the video diary of a young couple (Kristen Connolly and Will Rogers) cruising toward Maryland on a boat with their infant son. All of it adds up to a collage of escalating grossness, as innocent, water-based fun turns into a grisly epidemic fueled by ecological malfeasance.

Rashes and vomiting give way to severed tongues, chewed-up and exploding abdomens, all of it caused by isopods — insectlike aquatic beasts mutated by runoff from a chicken-processing plant and other environmental crimes. The quiet streets and marinas of Claridge soon resemble the landscape of a zombie movie, though the predators have more in common with the eager breeders of the “Alien” movies.

I’m in no position to assess the science of “Bay,” and I applaud, in principle, its attempt to be a conscientious piece of genre entertainment. I only wish it were scarier, or indeed scary at all. Mr. Levinson has many skills as a filmmaker — he is past having anything to prove on that score — but the basic techniques of dread and suspense don’t seem to interest him very much. There is a lot of nasty stuff to look at, but very little that is genuinely haunting, jolting or terrifying. If you are not already afraid about the state of our waterways, this movie won’t help you get there.

“The Bay” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Those isopods do some serious damage.
