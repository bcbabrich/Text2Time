As Governor Cuomo finished an impassioned speech this week at Princeton University on the plight of the country's poor, a freshman stood up to ask a question.

''Governor,'' the freshman asked, ''how do we go about ending poverty without either raising taxes tremendously or increasing spending dramatically? In concrete terms, what do you propose we do?''

Mr. Cuomo stood silent for a moment, looking out over McCosh Hall and its banners of ''Go Mario!'' and ''86 Albany/88 D.C.'' Then, after a five-minute response in which he continued his attacks on the policies of the Reagan Administration, he finally acknowledged that, in fact, he had no specific alternatives to propose.

To be sure, he said, he is working on some, but they are not ready.

After more than two years of widely publicized speeches by the Governor criticizing President Reagan's policies, Cuomo aides acknowledge privately that it is becoming awkward that he has nothing detailed to offer as an alternative. And even the Governor, a possible Presidential candidate in 1988, has begun to acknowledge the problem.
