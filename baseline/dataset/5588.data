Another method sometimes used to remove the nails in wooden shingles is to use a narrow chisel to gouge out the wood around the nail head, as shown in the other drawing. Then you can use a regular pry bar with nail-pulling claws at one end, or even a carpenter's claw hammer, to pull out the nails in the usual manner.

Asbestos shingles are very brittle and break easily, so when it is necessary to remove one, it is often easier to simply break the shingle with a hammer. Hit it hard enough in several places to smash it, then slide out the broken pieces. Then the nails can be pulled out with a regular claw hammer.

After the old shingle has been removed, a replacement shingle can be slid into place. Asbestos shingles should have holes drilled for nails; if they don't, you will have to drill them yourself before nailing them in place. Trying to drive a nail through an asbestos shingle without predrilling will almost certainly split the shingle. Wood shingles usually do not have to be predrilled for nailing, unless nails will be driven exceptionally close to the edges.

Before starting to nail shingles in place, be sure to line up the bottom edges carefully. Also make certain to use rustproof shingle nails (aluminum or galvanized) to avoid rust stains later on. Shingle nails have modest-size heads and are coated or serrated to resist pulling out or ''popping'' later on.

Bear in mind that the nails that will go through the top end of the shingle will have to first go through the bottom end of the shingle above it; and nails that go through the bottom end of the shingle will also go through the top of the shingle below it in most cases. This is true of wood shingles only. Answering the Mail

Q. I want to repaint my metal kitchen cabinets with a latex paint. They were last painted with an alkyd enamel. Will it be O.K. to go over this with a latex and, if so, is sanding required first? - R.M., Valley Stream, L.I.

A. You should definitely sand first -enough to remove all of the old gloss from the old enamel. As far as using a latex paint over an alkyd enamel, this should present no problem if you make sure you dull the gloss first. The only other precaution I would sugggest is to make certain that no bare metal is exposed before the latex paint is applied. The water in the latex could cause rust to form, and this rust may come through the paint. So to play safe, apply one coat of a rust-resistant metal primer on all exposed bare metal before you apply the latex enamel.
