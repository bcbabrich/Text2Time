FRIDAY PUZZLE — Well, that was fun. Ori Brian is back, and he offers us a Friday that experienced solvers might find fairly easy, but there are enough speed bumps to slow you down a bit.

Don’t race through this one. Take the time to enjoy the crunchy entries; those stacks in the northeast and southwest are great, as are the long Down entries. And even the slightly shorter entries in the west and east are fun. O.K., I pretty much liked the whole thing.

Tricky Clues

1A: I had OPEN before BITE for “Dentist’s instruction,” but TOM THUMB at 3D helped a lot.

5A: Brilliant clue. “Drawing that nobody wants” had my brain working overtime. What kind of drawing could the clue be hinting at? The answer is the drawing of the SHORT STRAW. That’s hilarious.

15A: “Stirs” can be a verb or a noun, so which one should we pick? There is no four-letter word I can think of that describes the physical act of stirring, so let’s try a noun answer. “Stirs” can also be fights or dust-ups. The answer to this clue is ADOS.
