To the Editor:

I did find, upon arrival in New York, that my English accent opened doors for me (''When Image Is All, the Accent Is Often English,'' July 11). But I was also appreciated for my conscientious attitude toward my job (paralegal before I became involved with voiceovers), which was ingrained in me in my English upbringing.
