Hours after Mr. Scoppetta's announcement, the leader of the union that represents the city's fire officers angrily charged that Captain Sweeney had been bludgeoned into confessing by senior fire and city officials who, he said, had reneged on a deal that would have been more favorable to the captain. The president of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association, Peter L. Gorman, accused Mr. Scoppetta of caving in to pressure from City Hall and said the commissioner had lost the confidence of the union and its members.

Mr. Gorman said the union did not condone Captain Sweeney's actions at the firehouse, but insisted that he did not deserve to be humiliated. ''It amounts to nothing more than a public humiliation, a public flogging,'' he said of the demotion.

By accepting the arrangement -- which was worked out by senior fire officials, city investigators and Staten Island prosecutors and offered to the captain Friday night after his testimony was completed -- Mr. Sweeney will avoid a departmental trial that was to have begun tomorrow, with dismissal and a loss of his entire pension as possible penalties, and he will not face criminal charges, Mr. Scoppetta said.

The city, for its part, extracted a confession that sharply clarified the events of Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 at the firehouse in Tottenville -- before and after Firefighter Michael R. Silvestri, 41, slammed a metal chair into the face of Firefighter Robert Walsh, 40, fracturing his jaw, nose and other facial bones. In the ensuing chaos, Captain Sweeney admitted, notifications to superiors were delayed, lies were told and records were falsified in a cover-up that quickly came apart.

Captain Sweeney, who was just going off duty when the assault occurred, was one of the firefighters who took Firefighter Walsh to Staten Island University Hospital, where he was listed in critical condition and where doctors were told he had fallen down a flight of stairs, a lie that was later mirrored in the firehouse's official journal. Firefighter Silvestri, though, was arrested on Jan. 1. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of assault, harassment and possession of a dangerous weapon.
