In late dealings, the bellwether Treasury long bond, the 8 7/8 percent issue due 2019, was offered at 97 16/32, up 11/32 on the day, with the yield easing to 9.12 percent, from 9.15 percent the day before.

''This morning's data shouldn't have been surprising, if indeed they were, because the economy has been actually slowing since mid-1987,'' said Irwin L. Kellner, senior vice president at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. ''The slowdown was obscured by the fact that it began coasting downward from a high growth rate of 5 percent, and is even now running at about 3 percent, if one eliminates the impact of last summer's drought.''

Mr. Kellner expects the next batch of economic statistics will show a slowing both in the economic growth rate and in inflation. Why, then, has the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, been pushing up interest rates for many months? In Front of Inflation

''Because it has to stay out in front of inflation, not to react to it,'' Mr. Kellner answered. ''Even today, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said that his policies would be considered successful if they prevented inflation from rising above the current level of roughly 5 percent. We think the fourth-quarter G.N.P. data tell us we are witnessing the topping out of inflation.''
