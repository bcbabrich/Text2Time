A Pianist's Lyricism That Fills Large Spaces Ivo Pogorelich Carnegie Hall

Few current young pianists make the big gesture in the big space better than Ivo Pogorelich. Mr. Pogorelich has the kind of sound that lets a treble melody played at mezzo-piano ring to the back seats of this large house. Schumann's "Symphonic Etudes" in its fully loaded mode (the traditional excisions restored) occupied half of Wednesday's recital. Four or five of its items are not at all easy, but here they literally exploded with color, with every shade precisely described. Schumann's tempos were otherwise taken at a stately walk. The rubato was generous, but phrases in progress never lost sight of their destinations.

The G-sharp-minor Etude best summed up the Pogorelich style. No simple songfulness for him. This was lyricism on a public scale: movement flexing and unflexing in the broadest way, glowing melody notes doubly emphasized by the right hand's tendency to lag behind the left. Two Mozart sonatas (K. 283, K. 331) and the D-minor Fantasy began the evening. Teacher's pets all, the three are known to every young student. Here, Mr. Pogorelich's grandness of phrase sat less easily. Listeners who bought into dotted rhythms left hanging in the air, or phrases pushed and pulled to their extreme, could enjoy without reservation Mr. Pogorelich's true if somewhat grandiose feeling for line. These ears could not. They preferred the quick movements, which offered (blessedly) not a lot of time for interpretive monkeying. BERNARD HOLLAND
