Democrats may have a reputation for being the “mommy party,” but according to a survey of restructuring professionals, Senator John McCain is the presidential candidate most likely to create a nurturing environment for turning around distressed companies.

That’s among the findings in a survey by AlixPartners, a business advisory firm that does brisk business in restructuring. As part of the firm’s second annual AlixPartners Risk Factor Index, the firm surveyed 44 bankruptcy lawyers, bankers, fund managers and others.

According to the survey, 78 percent of these individuals think Mr. McCain, the all-but-certain Republican nominee for president, would most aid the work of those in the restructuring industry. On this question, the two candidates for the Democratic nomination, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, earned just 11 percent each.

Mr. McCain has sometimes spoken candidly of the troubles facing parts of the American economy, most notably the auto industry. In the days before Michigan’s Republican primary in January, the senator from Arizona told audiences that many of the state’s auto-making jobs probably wouldn’t come back, a sentiment that Mitt Romney, his opponent at the time, deemed “defeatist.”

But no matter who is in office, respondents appear to think the federal government will intervene in the financial markets. About 74 percent of those surveyed expressed that view, citing the role taken by the Treasury department and the Federal Reserve in arranging Bear Stearns‘s sale to JPMorgan Chase.

What’s not in dispute is that these individuals expect to be busy. About 98 percent of respondents said a “big spike” in restructuring incidents is looming, and 65 percent said it would likely to come by this winter. (About 30 percent said it would arrive by this fall.)
