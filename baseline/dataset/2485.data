Little more than an armature, really, for Max's stream of consciousness musings, the plot of "The Sea" is deliberately slight. After his wife's death, Max returns to the seaside town where he spent his boyhood summers and reminisces about a family he came to know there in his 11th year. He remembers how he developed a fixation on the voluptuous Mrs. Grace, and how he eventually transferred those emotions to her daughter, Chloe. His long-ago memories of the Graces are intercut with more recent memories of his wife, Anna, and her painful death from cancer.

Max, a would-be art historian who has lived off Anna's inherited fortune, seems to have spent his copious amounts of free time gazing at his own navel and thinking very big thoughts about very little. He makes remarks like, "A thing that always struck me was the contrast between nest and egg, I mean the contingency of the former, no matter how well or even beautifully it was fashioned, and the latter's completedness, its pristine fullness." He describes a thunderstorm as a "spectacular display of Valhallan petulance" and a youthful crush as a "storm of passion" that left "the frail wings" of his emotions "burned and blasted by love's relentless flame." When he asks his daughter about her teddy bears, he refers to them as "your lares familiars."

In fact, Max talks like someone with a thesaurus permanently implanted in his brain: his monologue is studded with words like "leporine," "strangury," "perpetuance," "finical," "flocculent," "anthropic," "Avrilaceous," "anaglypta" and "assegais." Perhaps Max's grandiose language is meant to signify some sort of psychic defense mechanism on his part, but it's uncannily similar to the language employed by characters in Mr. Banville's earlier books. And together with his almost comical self-absorption, it makes Max sound like an annoying Peter Handke character on a bad day.

Equally irritating is Max's penchant for describing and redescribing everyone in his life and everything he sees in minute physical detail that radiates a prissy disgust for the human body. He describes his daughter's "upper gums, glistening and whitely pink." He describes Mrs. Grace's "haunches quivering under the light stuff of her summer dresses." And he describes Chloe's teeth as possessing a "delicate damp grey-green" tinge "like the damp light under trees after rain." Of his own appearance, he observes: "This morning it was the state of my eyes that struck me most forcibly, the whites all craquelured over with those tiny bright-red veins and the moist lower lids inflamed and hanging a little way loose of the eyeballs."

No doubt this obsessive focus on the physical is intended to suggest Max's difficulty in making emotional sense of his life, but combined with his windy, self-indulgent abstractions, it only serves to alienate the reader from his story. Though "The Sea" may deal with some of the gravest issues of life -- death, loss, regret -- it remains, in the end, a chilly, dessicated and pompously written book that stands in sharp contrast to the vibrancy of many of this year's other Booker nominees.
