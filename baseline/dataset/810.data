MELLON--Giles, of Brooklyn, New York and Lakeville, Connecticut died at home in Brooklyn just one year ago today at age 82. Giles was a husband, a father, a grandfather, a father-in-law, a brother-in-law, an uncle, a brother, a friend, and a colleague. His passions were deep: literature, history, music, art, and above all, his family. Giles's sense of play was ever present and so touching. A rare spirit with both a heart and intellect larger than life, Giles is missed and remembered every day. We all love him so deeply. Kate Josh, Mathilde, and Xavier Chris, Elizabeth, and Lucy Jonathan
