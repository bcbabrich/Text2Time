ZYNGA (a haiku)

Friday S-1 drop?

We would trade a purple cow

For our weekend back.

MONEYBAGS (a limerick)

A man and his mega receipt

Gave rumor mills all kinds of heat

Whose eight-figure sum?

He’s kept himself mum

But I think it’s Peterson, Pete

Southern Union

GEORGE L. LINDEMANN (a tanka)

Massive gas pipelines

Ignited a bidding war

If “George being George”

Means jets and consulting deals

We would like to be George, too.

MADOFF (a cinquain)

Madoff,

Scapegoat, victim

Calls himself “piñata”

Investors: “So, where’s our candy?”

Moron.

APOCALYPSE FUNDS (a sonnet)

Apocalypse, a bad word in the past

Now finds itself a selling point for some.

Big black-swan funds are popping up, and fast,

With promises of gains, should kingdom come.

But others like the funds that take more aim

At equities and bonds, and maybe gold.

Except for Greece, the outlook seems quite tame.

Will all humanity really just fold?

Alas! Investors with some cash to burn will see

The long tail isn’t really such a sin

They’ll say to hedgies with a bil or three

We find your doom-speak probable, we’re in!

If seas rise and all worldly things must go,

At least Boaz Weinstein will have some dough.
