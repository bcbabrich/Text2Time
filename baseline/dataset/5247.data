Sematech, the ambitious industry research consortium designed to restore the ability of the American semiconductor industry to compete with the Japanese, is having difficulties finding a chief executive.

The consortium has been trying to hire an experienced executive from one of its member companies. But the companies are reluctant to part with key personnel and have made it attractive for the executives to stay. This difficulty is viewed as an indication that the 14 member companies are less inclined to share their manpower for the common good than has been publicly proclaimed.

''Sematech will suffer if we don't get someone in soon,'' said Robert N. Noyce, vice chairman of the Intel Corporation and a member of a three-member committee charged with finding a chief executive. Pentagon Annoyed

The inability of the industry to find a leader for its much touted research consortium is frustrating the Department of Defense, which is underwriting half of the cost, and impeding planning for the project, Government and industry officials said.
