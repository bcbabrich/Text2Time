LONDON, July 31 (AP)—Kenneth Gatland, vice president of the British Interplanetary Society, described the moon landing today as “a stupendous achievement on the path toward placing the first, human. explorers on the moon.”

He said that it should scotch criticism that the project of landing man on the moon by 1970 was suffering from lack of information about the physical condition of the lunar surface.
