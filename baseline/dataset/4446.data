Many critics, however, argue that the film went seriously awry in its depiction of the liberations of Buchenwald and Dachau. They complain that the moral edifice embodied in remembrance can crumble if history is handled casually, or distorted to fit current needs -- and nothing having to do with the places whose names resonate with the century's worst crimes can be dismissed as a "detail." Inmates Recall Black Soldiers

And so, despite evident good intentions all around, the focus of attention has shifted from the intermingled histories of blacks and Jews and to another question: Does "The Liberators" tell the truth?

How could this have happened?

In 1982, William Miles, a prize-winning documentary film maker, began hearing tales of the 761st and other black battalions during his work on another documentary, "The Different Drummer: Blacks in the Military," broadcast in 1983. In 1985 he saw a letter in The New York Times written by Benjamin Bender, a survivor of Buchenwald, who recalled seeing black soldiers at the liberation of the camp. In 1989 the presence of black soldiers was mentioned by Elie Wiesel, who was also an inmate there.

Mr. Miles joined Nina Rosenblum, whose credits include "Through the Wire," an award-winning documentary about female prisoners in the United States. With backing from Channel 13, they produced "The Liberators," subtitled, "Fighting on Two Fronts in World War II." It is essentially a chronological account of the tank battalion and other black units, like the 183d Engineering Battalion, that fought in Europe in World War II.

A major point is the role supposedly played by members of the 761st in the liberation of Buchenwald and Dachau. The film shows several survivors of the camps, including Mr. Bender and Israel Lau, now the chief rabbi of Tel Aviv, testifying to the presence of black troops. Several former enlisted men of the 761st Battalion and the 183d Engineers also describe their roles in liberating the two camps. William McBurney and Leonard Smith recount driving their tanks through the gates of Dachau and detail the horrors they saw there. Critics Say TV Was Warned

Still, questions about the film's accuracy were raised even before it was nationally shown on Nov. 11. Mr. Williams recalled a phone conversation he said he had about six months ago with Mr. Miles in which he told Mr. Miles that "the stuff about Buchenwald and Dachau is a lie." Mr. Miles, he said, did not reply.

Mr. Rappaport, the Sixth Division veteran, said: "I got in touch with Bill Miles, who was very polite. I told him our division was the Sixth Armored and that we liberated Buchenwald. I was there. I saw no black troops. 'Well, Mr. Rappaport,' he said, 'we have witnesses.' "
