'Sex' and the Lie

The big lie in television shows about New York used to be that we all lived in large apartments with skyline views. The current big lie, thanks to ''Sex and the City,'' is that single women in New York date an endless stream of troublesome and inappropriate men. (Actually, months go by before one has the opportunity to meet one.)

The series, however, is a huge hit, as was evidenced by the extravagant party HBO threw to kick off the new season Wednesday night. Under a tent in Damrosch Park were canopied beds, pink lighting (as single girls know, everybody looks good under pink lighting) and a display of MANOLO BLAHNIK shoes, safely encased under glass.

''Sorry, I'm not talking to the press tonight,'' said MONICA LEWINSKY.

Most of the other celebrities, in a crowd that included SANDRA BERNHARD, RUSSELL SIMMONS, KELSEY GRAMMER, RICHARD BELZER, DONALD TRUMP, SONIA BRAGA, MACAULAY CULKIN and many cast members from HBO's other big show, ''The Sopranos,'' felt no such constraints.

SARAH JESSICA PARKER, left, attending with husband MATTHEW BRODERICK, offered tips for a happy marriage. (Short version: a little absence makes it more interesting.) CANDACE BUSHNELL, whose newspaper columns inspired the series, said that in cities across America, women complained about being unable to get a date. ''I thought it was very New York, but I now see it's quite universal,'' said Ms. Bushnell, who has a boyfriend, albeit in London.
