Jury Duty Calls A Court Officer

New York's chief judge, JUDITH S. KAYE, likes to say that anyone can be called for jury duty these days. Yesterday was her spokesman's day. GARY SPENCER, the court's public information officer, dutifully filed into the Albany County Courthouse along with hundreds of other potential jurors called for the trial of four New York City police officers accused in the shooting death of Amadou Diallo.

More than 1,000 prospective jurors were scheduled to arrive at different times in the morning. ''I was the third wave going in,'' he said.

Mr. Spencer, 46, received his jury duty notice in the mail last week. He said that it was his first in 24 years as a New York State resident. Judge Kaye has been called twice but was never picked to serve on a jury. Last summer, MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI became the first New York City mayor in memory -- if not history -- to sit on a jury.

Yesterday, Mr. Spencer's name was checked off a very long list. Then he and other potential jurors were told about routine courtroom procedures. Mr. Spencer said he and his group were excused after an hour and a half, but were told that they might be called back today.
