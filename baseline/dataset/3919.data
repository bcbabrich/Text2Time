''We had a lot of shots in the first period,'' said Pat LaFontaine, who set up Kovalev's score. ''We should have capitalized. With 14 shots it would be nice to have a period where we throw the puck in and get a nice lead. But unfortunately, it hasn't been going that way.''

Even so, there were a few reasons for optimism on the part of the Rangers.

Brian Leetch, who has a league-worst plus-minus mark of minus-20, played well yesterday. He finished the game even, and contributed to the Rangers' pressure in the offensive zone in the first period. ''It doesn't turn around overnight,'' the Rangers' captain said.

''Brian Leetch played a much better game,'' Campbell said. ''Game by game he's getting better.''

Richter, who made 30 saves, kept the Rangers in the game late. And Adam Graves, who returned recently from a sprained knee, skated like the Graves of old for much of the game, creating many scoring chances.

Fitzgerald opened the scoring after picking up the puck when Bill Lindsay whiffed on a shot in front of Richter. With the Rangers' goalie expecting Lindsay's shot, Fitzgerald slapped the puck between Richter's skates.

Kovalev's score came during a power play. He was fed the puck by LaFontaine, then beat Vanbiesbrouck with a blistering slap shot from the point. Graves and Kevin Stevens stood in front of Vanbiesbrouck, obstructing the Panther goalie's view. It was Kovalev's sixth goal in the last 10 games. Before that, he had not scored in the first 18 games of the season.

''I thought we came out and had a much better first period that we've had in a long time,'' Richter said. ''We did not sustain it all game.''

SLAP SHOTS

NIKLAS SUNDSTROM was viciously swatted in the head and neck by the stick of KIRK MULLER, who was called for a minor high-sticking penalty in the first period. Sundstrom was not seriously injured, but he did miss his next shift. Coach COLIN CAMPBELL said after the game that General Manager NEIL SMITH intended to send a videotape of the incident for review by to BRIAN BURKE, a National Hockey League vice president. ''Neil has already informed the league,'' Campbell said. ''It was a vicious chop.'' . . . Several Rangers complained afterward about the condition of the ice at Madison Square Garden, saying it was bumpy and slow. It was not the first time this season players had taken issue with ice conditions there. ''The puck was bouncing and guys were working extra hard,'' PAT LAFONTAINE said. It wasn't in the greatest shape in the second and third periods.''
