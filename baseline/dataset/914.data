Administrivial Free Gift Alert! Guess who is helping us ring in the New Year? Our former Wordplay host and talented artist Patrick Merrell has distributed a hand-drawn calendar to friends in years past, and this year he is graciously offering a science-themed one to Wordplay readers. Click here to choose between a large, 6.5″ x 9″ version and a smaller, 5″ x 7″ version. Thanks, Patrick!

WEDNESDAY’S PUZZLE — If you’ve ever wondered how your favorite constructors come up with their ideas for puzzle themes, wonder no more. Sometimes it’s as easy as looking down at your bowl of breakfast cereal.

FROOT LOOPS are a little too much on the sweet and artificially colored side for my taste, but I can understand why they’re so attractive to kids and teens. David Steinberg apparently gets his Kix from them too: he’s based an entire puzzle on them, and a very funny one at that. If you were to take a PAPAYA, for example, and somehow — defying the laws of physics — curl it into a LOOP, you would have one theme entry in Mr. Steinberg’s puzzle today. Spoon through the rest of his crunchy puzzle today and see what other fruits you can curl.

There’s some good wordplay here too: ONRAMPS are, of course, “things that lead to mergers?” and while I thought the clue was better than the somewhat odd entry, ODORIZE means to “make scents of?” That’s funny.

I’m not sure why my eye was so attracted to the center of this grid, what with all the cereal floating around. Maybe the YAZ/TRANSECT crossing riveted me for some reason.

I was a bit put off by a few missteps: a SOAPER, an odd entry anyway, is not a soap opera to me; it is a person who practices soap making. I also wasn’t able to get NONARAB from the clue “Jewish or Iranian, e.g.” That seems like a Friday or a Saturday clue to me, but as always, your mileage etc. etc.

There have been many singers who have played BESS from “Porgy and Bess” over the years, but one of my favorite versions of “Summertime” is sung by Leontyne Price:
