Federal regulators are proposing an unusual method to provide more educational television for children: broadcasters will be forced to carry up to five hours of educational programming a week, but stations can pay other stations in their areas to do the job for them.

The idea, which the Federal Communications Commission will formally propose on Wednesday, is the latest and perhaps the strangest attempt yet by the Government to promote social improvement by invoking the marketplace's self-interest.

Under the plan, television broadcasters would be forced for the first time to carry a minimum amount of educational programming for children -- three hours a week initially, and an increase to five hours after several years. But these requirements would be "tradable," so that a station could comply with the law by paying another station in the same city to carry all but one of those extra hours.

The proposal resembles a Government program in which companies that generate air pollution can trade "pollution credits" among themselves as a more flexible way to meet clean air requirements.
