Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, the centerpiece of Donald J. Trump's struggling casino empire, reported a quarterly loss of nearly $49 million yesterday, further undermining the company's tenuous financial position and complicating its ability to meet hefty debt payments due at the end of this month and in the fall.

Trump Hotels has about $1.8 billion in debt that has drained the company of the cash it needs to maintain its properties and compete effectively in the Atlantic City gambling market. Over the last few months, the company and its bondholders have been considering options to deal with the debt burden, including a prepackaged bankruptcy or a recapitalization that would cede control of the company to a major investment bank.

Either option would result in a sharply decreased role at Trump Hotels for Mr. Trump, the chief executive, who has been accused by analysts and bondholders of ineffective management and slipshod financial practices.

Trump Hotels said it lost $48.8 million, or $1.63 a share, in the quarter, compared with a loss of $24 million, or $1.09 a share, in the period a year earlier. Trump Hotels has never been profitable since it became a public company in 1995. The company said yesterday's losses included a provision of $19.1 million related to the payment of state taxes in Indiana. The company's quarterly revenue was $276.2 million, down from $278.8 million.
