Military equipment to detect chemical agents during the war in the Persian Gulf was inadequate and unreliable, and there was no system to warn quickly of biological agents, a draft report on illnesses of veterans concludes.

The interim report, obtained by The Associated Press, was compiled by the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses. It said chemical warfare detectors "suffered from a number of serious deficiencies": an inability to detect mustard agents, which Iraq possessed in large amounts; an ability to measure only toxic chemical levels that could cause death or acute symptoms, and an extremely high number of false alarms.

The 12-member committee was appointed by President Clinton last year to investigate the causes of and responses to sicknesses that afflicted thousands of people who served in the 1991 war.

The Pentagon and Government health studies have found no evidence that Iraq used chemical or biological weapons against American forces.
