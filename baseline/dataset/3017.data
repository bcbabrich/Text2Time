On Wednesday, Dallas Cowboys safety Darren Woodson was fined $75,000 for a helmet-to-helmet tackle on Sunday of Seattle Seahawks receiver Darrell Jackson, who sustained a concussion on the tackle and had a seizure after the game.

The league said neither Dawkins nor Woodson had committed such an infraction before.

Despite the severity and visibility of the hits -- Dawkins's occurred in a prime-time game and Woodson's in the game in which Emmitt Smith broke Walter Payton's career rushing record -- Tagliabue said the league was not considering an increase in the amount of fines or in the length of suspensions.

''We will continue to have a high threshold before we suspend because it's a severe penalty,'' he said. ''A suspension for one N.F.L. game is the equivalent of a suspension for 10 games in baseball. But we were not going to tolerate repeat violations of the critical rules.''

H. Wayne Huizenga, owner of the Miami Dolphins, said stricter enforcement of the rules was needed. ''I think they have to look more at suspensions than fines,'' Huizenga said. ''These guys love to play, and a suspension means more than a fine. There have already been policies in place, they just haven't been enforced.''

Also yesterday, a month after a group of lawyers threatened a lawsuit against the N.F.L. for its hiring practices, the owners created a five-man committee to oversee diversity in the league. Two of the league's 32 head coaches are African-American.
