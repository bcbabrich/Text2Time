Updated, 5:50 p.m. | A 90-year-old man at his home in Staten Island was attacked on Tuesday morning by two pit bulls that belonged to his neighbor, the police said.

The man, who was later identified as Henry S. Piotrowski, was bitten by the dogs on his arms and his legs and taken by emergency medical workers to Richmond University Medical Center, in the West Brighton neighborhood, where the police said he was in critical condition.

The police said the attack occurred about 11 a.m. in the backyard of Mr. Piotrowski’s home, at 94 John Street, in the Elm Park section, on the northern part of Staten Island. Upon arriving at 11:03 a.m., the police found the man with “severe wounds to his arms and legs,” the authorities said.

Mr. Piotrowski is an Army veteran who fought in a tank unit in World War II, the authorities said.

The police said that Mr. Piotrowski’s backyard and that of the dogs’ owner were somewhat adjoined, but it remained unclear how the attack occurred. “The dogs got loose and somehow got into his private property and that is when the attack took place,’’ a police spokesman said.

The police said in a statement, “No animals were at the scene when police arrived.” But later, the authorities said the two dogs, both pit bulls, had been corralled at 59 Newark Avenue.

The dogs — named Brutus and Popeye — were taken by Animal Care & Control of New York City to its shelter at 2336 Linden Boulevard, in Brooklyn, and were put down by injection, said Richard P. Gentles, a spokesman for the agency. He said that New York City dog owners are required to have licenses for their dogs, to generally keep their dogs leashed in public and to ensure that their dogs have current rabies vaccinations. Mr. Gentles said it was not clear whether any of those requirements had been met for the two pit bulls.

James McNair, the owner of the dogs, was in police custody at the 120th Precinct and prosecutors working for District Attorney Daniel M. Donovan Jr. were considering whether to file charges, the police said.
