In the future, people may get artificial hearts when their own wear out. John C. Moise is betting on it. Mr. Moise, 57, has organized a new research and development company called Nimbus Inc., based in a suburb of Sacramento, Calif. He had worked at the Aerojet-General Corporation for 27 years, the last 10 on artificial heart research, and when Aerojet decided to divest itself of the program and concentrate on defense contract work, Mr. Moise and a group of other employees stepped in.

''What we essentially did was to buy the equipment being used in the program,'' Mr. Moise said yesterday. The private company also received approval from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to transfer contracts totaling $2.4 million to Nimbus from Aerojet. And it has won a new $4 million, four-year contract on its own from the Government institution.

The Government, and therefore Nimbus, is concentrating on leftheart assist systems, which take over the work of failing left ventricles. ''Total heart replacement is a much trickier problem,'' Mr. Moise said.

The medical profession is divided on artificial hearts, he added. ''A third would think the whole thing is crazy,'' he said. ''A third would back the left-heart assist and a third the total replacement. There's no consensus.''
