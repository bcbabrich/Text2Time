Despite the CityHawks' 5-23 record in two years in the Arena League, and less-than-hoped-for attendance, New York's experiment with football on a carpeted hockey rink will continue.

We will be back, CityHawks General Manager John Hall said last night during his team's season-ending 77-36 loss to the Albany Firebirds at Madison Square Garden. We've made strides forward, but they didn't equate into wins and losses, Hall said.

The team's quarterback, Mike Perez, had hinted at retirement, but last night he said he would return for a sixth season, according to Frank Murphy, the Garden's senior vice president for sports.

Last night, Perez completed 18 of 32 passes for 233 yards and 2 touchdowns. Albany's Mike Pawlawski threw 8 touchdown passes. RON DICKER
