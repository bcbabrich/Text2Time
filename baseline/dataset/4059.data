Edmund Debler, an analyst with Mehta & Isaly, said he expected Sangstat to grab 10 percent of the cyclosporine market, which he estimated would total $2 billion by the year 2000. ''We think they're going to sell it at a reduced price,'' he said, suggesting that Sangstat might sell a year's supply of the drug for $3,000 compared with Sandoz's price of $5,000. But, he added, ''you've got to figure Sandoz will throw up some road blocks along the way.''

Sandoz officials could not be reached for comment. But analysts agreed that the company would fight hard to protect cyclosporine, its most profitable drug. In the United States and Europe, there are more than 200,000 organ transplant patients who must take immunosuppressive drugs daily for the rest of their lives. The majority of these patients take cyclosporine, which is one of the 10 biggest drugs worldwide in revenues.

Philippe Pouletty, Sangstat's chairman and chief executive, said that the company fully expected stiff opposition from Sandoz, but that it had the wherewithal to compete on more fronts than price alone. ''Being a transplant-only company dedicated to the field, with 12 products in our pipeline, more than Sandoz or anyone else, we have the means to compete,'' he said. ''We're not a generic company; we're a transplant-dedicated company.''

Under F.D.A. regulations, however, Sangstat's cyclosporine will be reviewed as a generic drug, which means it must only show that it is therapeutically equivalent to the existing product, rather than having to demonstrate long-term safety and efficacy. The so-called A.N.D.A. (abbreviated new drug approval process) should be more rapid than a full review, but analysts said the F.D.A. might feel no urgency because there already was an effective drug on the market.

Sangstat is also anticipating clinical trial results on another transplant drug, Thymoglobulin, which is intended to block acute kidney rejection. Dr. Pouletty said the company will report results of that trial in October, and if they are favorable, could apply for marketing approval early next year. Sangstat recently started the Transplant Pharmacy, which will make its drugs available to patients directly by mail, circumventing established drug distributors.
