The Mets staged their first full workout of spring training today and delivered some theater to their new audience on Florida's Gold Coast. Dwight Gooden pitched batting practice for the first time and fired the heater past sluggers like Gary Carter and Darryl Strawberry.

It was a bit of old magic in a new setting, and while it didn't count in anybody's batting or pitching records, it did startle the fans and the players. This was a no-nonsense Gooden, revving up for the first time this spring, for the first time since he lost his bid for a raise in salary arbitration and took a $100,000 cut instead.

''He was overpowering,'' Strawberry said. ''He looks a lot stronger this year. The way he threw today, I'd have to say he's throwing more like the year when he won the Cy Young Award.''

''I didn't think he was going to be throwing that hard the first time out, but he was popping it,'' Strawberry said. ''A lot of people asked me, is he throwing hard? I said step in and see for yourself.'' Fastball 'Three Weeks Away'
