To the Editor:

Williamson M. Evers (''Does America Need a 'G.I. Bill' for Youth?'', Op-Ed, April 15) argues that Senator Sam Nunn's plan to make student aid conditional on one or two years of service to the state would, if enacted, ''revive the concept of indentured servitude, a form of bondage in Colonial America.'' He adds, ''Hundreds of thousands of young people would become 20th-century indentured students.''

If Mr. Evers were right, the Nunn plan would be not only bad policy, but also unconstitutional. The 13th Amendment (1865) prohibits not only chattel ''slavery,'' but also any other form of ''involuntary servitude.'' The latter words were included to outlaw any vestiges of indentured bondage inherited from Colonial American law and the similar system of peonage in the Territory of New Mexico inherited from Spanish and Mexican law. In 1867, Congress passed the antipeonage law, still on our statute books (42 United States Code s 1994), which enforces the 13th Amendment by making null and void all laws enforcing the ''service or labor of any persons . . . in liquidation of any debt or obligation, or otherwise.''

The flaw in Mr. Evers's thesis is its confusion of two radically different phenomena: (1) the state's compelling the performance, by the servant, of a contract for personal service to pay off a debt previously incurred, and (2) the offer of a future benefit (a college education) in return for the completion of voluntary service in a national program.

The first is a description of involuntary servitude, which is prohibited by the 13th Amendment. The second, which features neither debt nor compulsion, is the essence of the Nunn plan. The difference between the two is vital: an indentured servant, like a New Mexican peon, could not walk off his job with impunity. If he did, the authorities could recapture him, put him back to work and, if he refused, put him in jail. Under Senator Nunn's plan, a voluntarily participating would-be college student would be free to drop out of the program at any time. CYRIL C. MEANS JR. New York, April 15, 1989
