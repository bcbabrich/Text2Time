On July 18, Premier League club Sunderland revealed its new home uniform.

The shirt was not particularly noteworthy. After all, there is only so much you can do with red and white stripes. But those famous colors — Sunderland remains the last striped team to win the title in a English top division — were adorned with a new and unusual sponsor: Invest in Africa. This unique and controversial deal is causing plenty of debate.

Invest in Africa is a not-for-profit “partnership of companies” with the declared aim of “promoting Africa as open for business, by challenging misconceptions and inspiring new investors.” The organization boasts of an African middle class of 300,000,000, which is “soon to be bigger than the entire populations of Brazil and Russia combined.” As a result, the publicity material reads, Africa is the “world’s best-kept investment secret.”

The company asserts that a shirt sponsorship with Sunderland is a “unique opportunity to use the global reach of the Premier League to help spread prosperity across Africa and bring new opportunities to local businesses.” In return, Sunderland will apparently “build its fan base and global brand, particularly in Africa where nearly 300 million people watch Premier League matches.”

When the deal was first announced in late June four men posed outside Sunderland’s Stadium of Light. The club’s owner, the Texan Ellis Short, spoke of a “sponsor that will allow us to grow our market share worldwide.” David Miliband MP, Sunderland vice-chairman and the former British foreign secretary, hollered, “Join us, help build Invest in Africa and reap the benefits.” Midfielder Craig Gardner grinned and posed with a soccer ball. The fourth man was Aidan Heavey, Tullow Oil chief executive and a man with a huge role to play.

Tullow Oil operates in 15 African countries and is the “continent’s leading independent oil company.” Tullow is the founding partner of Invest in Africa and, as yet, the only investor in the initiative. While Invest in Africa and Tullow are technically separate entities, the name on Sunderland’s shirt is exclusively financed by the oil company.

Since its founding in 1985, Tullow has found a huge amount of oil. The company will soon begin extraction in Uganda (where it estimates reserves of up to 2.5 billion barrels) and recently made new discoveries in Kenya.

While the “scramble for Africa’s oil” continues with ferocity, Tullow’s role in the rush for resources has been criticized. In February, Foreign Policy magazine reported on “Uganda’s oil scandal” and the “complete absence of corporate social responsibility on the part of Tullow,” where villagers had been driven off their land with no compensation. Tullow was accused of paying millions of dollars of bribes to Ugandan officials. Tullow denied the allegations and took the unusual step of publishing supporting documents on its Web site.

Deep concerns with the allocation of oil resources and corruption, however, persist.

After the announcement of Sunderland’s Invest in Africa deal there was some negative reaction in Britain. The London-based N.G.O. Platform saw the arrangement as Tullow “framing its drilling operations in the rhetoric of growth and development.” After this, The Independent published an article on the “concerns over the suitability of Sunderland’s new sponsor.”

Tullow once again reacted quickly to the criticism, with its head of media relations giving a series of interviews to the Sunderland fan site Roker Report. In these posts George Cazenove answers questions on exclusion zones for fishermen around oil rigs, corporate social responsibility and transparency.

Cazenove responded to the coverage with: “The guys who put together these comments about Tullow are anti-oil and anti-oil in Africa, and they don’t believe that oil companies should be operating in Africa. That’s fine, that’s their perspective, there’s a perfectly coherent, intellectual argument to support that. There’s an equally coherent argument on our side that drilling for oil in Africa and doing business in Africa, which we’ve done successfully for 26 years is a good thing.”

Sunderland supporters, meanwhile, are divided. Many have been seduced by the financial possibilities for the club, as Miliband asserted in an interview, saying, “It’s the best commercial deal in Sunderland’s history.” Others feel much more concerned. Some have pointed out that the reputation of the club is now aligned with that of the African oil industry. Many feel morally compromised by the positive language of Invest in Africa and the more complicated situation with Tullow Oil. Some, acutely aware of their place in the soccer ecosystem, simply do not believe the hype. During the launch, Heavey said, “At a stroke, this association will make Sunderland the most popular club in Africa.” That seems unlikely.

In the past Sunderland’s sponsors have been local brewers, car dealers and online bingo companies. This big international deal for a midranking club shows how branding and business development dominate the Premier League at all levels. If Sunderland increases its “market share” in Africa successfully enough it may be able to rise a few places up a league already clogged with money. It remains to be seen how many more partners will join Invest in Africa, how Ugandan corruption will be dealt with and how much damage the oil industry may do to the people, politics and environment of Africa.
