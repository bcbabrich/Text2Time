The Bel Canto Opera, which is still locked in a struggle with Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians over collective bargaining for its occasional employees, has decided for the present to proceed with nonunion players. At the company's performance of Cavalli's ''Calisto'' Sunday afternoon at St. Bartholomew's Church, members of the Riverside Orchestra accompanied, sounding neither worse nor better than the bands assembled by this troupe in the past.

But the troupe itself did better than usual. Thanks to a few promising singers in the cast and a director (Elly Stone, the cabaret singer) who knew how to have fun with the piece without either undermining its vein of seriousness or forcing the comic points, the performance surpassed expectations.

Raymond Leppard's realization of Cavalli's skeletal score was used. The score of ''La Calisto'' is not a familiar one to this critic, so I cannot report at first hand the pros and cons of Mr. Leppard's edition. But one would like to have a non-Leppard ''Calisto'' locally to compare; while Mr. Leppard's realizations are loving and often beautiful, their publication and distribution does a disservice by making the doctored version more convenient to perform than the original (which means starting from scratch and making one's own realization).

But the Bel Canto production was welcome in any case, first because it was, on its own terms, a good show; second because New York's last ''Calisto'' - an Opera at the Academy production - left a bad taste. Bel Canto has its own amateurish side, but the aim on this occasion was subtler and higher. Comic play with contemporary gestures and types was reserved mostly for the episodes with the drag role of the nymph Linfea (Ladd Boris, quite funny) and the satyr who pursues her (Trudy Wodzinsky, slightly tacky but effective).
