The French and West German Governments have approved joint development of a combat and support helicopter called the Tiger, the French arms procurement agency said today. The contract is worth about $1.2 billion and covers development of the helicopter and construction of five prototypes over 10 years to be built by a consortium owned by Aerospatiale of France and Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany.

The contract does not cover turbines for the helicopter, which are being designed by a consortium consisting of MTU of West Germany, Turbomeca of France and Rolls-Royce of Britain. The first flight of a prototype is expected in April 1991.
