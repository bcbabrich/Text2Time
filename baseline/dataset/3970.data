Dancers often use deliberately distorted or exaggerated movements to make their works emotionally and thematically expressive. Yet "Three," which three choreographers presented on Thursday night at Performance Space 122, remained surprisingly uncommunicative, although it was filled with distortion.

Claude Wampler's "Geisha Secretia, Panda's Glands: A Pheromonol Pursuit" was the piece that came closest to being theatrically vivid. Unfortunately, it was also long-winded. As she kept putting on elaborate costumes, many of which made her resemble a geisha, Ms. Wampler seemed to be trying to act like a femme fatale. Her wiles were often amusing, and there was a charming scene in which she dressed a dog as a geisha. Nevertheless, the solo was lackadaisical in its pacing.

In "I Hear Crows Crying," Yasuko Yokoshi demonstrated that she knows how to create the illusion that she is responding to invisible, yet very real, presences around her. This solo, in which dancing was combined with a film, also by the choreographer, sought to evoke family memories. Yet watching it was like paging through a stranger's family album.

Although strong in stage presence, Li Chiao-Ping was dramatically amorphous in two solos, "Chi" and "Fin de Siecle," and in "Lattice Cuts," a duet created in collaboration with Sally Silvers. The duet got off to a compelling start when Ms. Silvers laboriously entered, clinging to the back wall as if for dear life. Nothing that followed equaled the power of that moment. JACK ANDERSON
