Kenneth C. Griffin, founder of the Citadel Investment Group, came about as close as legally possible Tuesday to advertise that his highflying $20 billion hedge fund is on the edge of going public, Dow Jones reported.

“The asset management businesses really have been the shining stars of the last 12 months,” he said Tuesday as part of a Milken Institute panel titled “State of the State of Wall Street: Creating Opportunity Out of Chaos.”

While he lambasted Bear Stearns, UBS and other investment and commercial banks for risk-management gaffes that have led to near- catastrophic losses, he cheerily said the climate for asset managers such as Citadel and fixed-income specialist Pimco “looks pretty good over the next six to 12 months.” He added that investors appreciate the strong returns amid the gloomy environment for financial services firms.

Mr. Griffin has sparked I.P.O. chatter with several Wall Street hires, including the news last fall that the firm had brought in John Andrews, Goldman Sach‘s head of investor relations, as a managing director. The speculation that Citadel may go public resurfaced in February when the firm announced that it had split its hedge-fund business from an options market-making unit.

However, Mr. Griffin told Dow Jones following his speech at the Milken Institute that he doesn’t expect to go public any time soon.
