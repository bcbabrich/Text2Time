In what we assume will be our final look at late-night comedy’s coverage of celebrity death, we come at last to “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,” which addressed the subject on Tuesday night. (What was that you were saying about “aged news,” Jason Jones?)

In this merciless clip, Jon Stewart emcees a portion of the RIPpy Awards, commemorating “those media alchemists who spin celebrity death into television gold.” It concludes with the moment that the “Daily Show” declares to be “the single stupidest comment about Michael Jackson‘s death.”
