"Berlin is on the razor's edge," Mr. Kolhoff said. "It can be a great metropolis, or it can be a poverty zone. Both are possible."

But the other argument is over the symbolism and the political effects of the move. For most Germans, Berlin stands for recovery and reconstruction and the defiance of the Soviet attempt to starve the city out of its freedom with the 1948 blockade. Berlin also recalls the flight to freedom of millions of East Germans that provoked construction of the Berlin wall.

But from a historical perspective, it also stands for Prussian militarism and failed empires, and the failed democracy of the Weimar period with the hyperinflation, disorder and decadence out of which Nazism arose.

"Many Germans never liked Berlin," said Joachim Trenkner, a television producer who has seen Berlin through thick and thin. "They regard it a little the way the rest of America sees New York. Basically an evil place, even if lively and interesting. They go there to amuse themselves, but they don't really like it or trust it." The Political Element

Partly, this is political, he admits. Berlin is run by a coalition of Social Democrats and a leftist grouping called the Alternative List that is often at loggerheads with the conservative Bonn Government. When Chancellor Helmut Kohl rushed to Berlin last November at the opening of the wall, the excited crowds booed him.

There is a strong anarchic scene, and the city is perceived by many in the west as overrun by foreigners. Polish moonlighters and Soviet Jewish immigrants abound, and a large Turkish population remains from the effort to hire workers from Turkey to offset a labor drain caused when working-class families fled the city's isolation after the wall went up. Now the crumbling Kreuzberg district is sometimes called Little Istanbul, Turkish newspapers are edited here and there are two Turkish television stations.

Boosters of Berlin like Mr. Kolhoff like to point to surveys like one taken recently in what used to be East Germany showing that 87 percent of the population there favor Berlin as capital. But there are dissenters.
