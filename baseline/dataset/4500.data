NEARLY two decades ago the Federal Government formed an elite, super-secret team to hunt down nuclear weapons that bad guys of one sort or another might hide on American soil. Now, with the bombing of the World Trade Center in February and the unraveling of a plot to blow up other New York City targets in July, the team is racing to update its methods and gear. Even President Clinton has fretted about one of the most nightmarish of modern scenarios -- terrorists with the ultimate weapon.

Making a nuclear warhead is certainly a lot harder than concocting a homemade bomb out of diesel fuel and fertilizer, which is what the Trade Center bombers did. A prime worry is the possibility of stolen warheads. The country's two major nuclear weapons labs are now working to improve methods for tracking them down and are wrestling with what to do if one should ever be found -- a predicament the Nuclear Emergency Search Team, or NEST, is meant to confront.

Over the years, the team has responded to more than 80 bomb threats against the United States that were judged credible. All turned out to be fakes. Even so, the anxiety index rose in 1991 as Iraq was revealed to be well on its way to building a bomb. It soared in 1992 with the disintegration of the Soviet Union and a flurry of questions over the disposition of its 32,000 nuclear warheads.

The Federal Government first got serious about detection after a 1974 fiasco involving the first major threat of nuclear extortion. The Federal Bureau of Investigation received a note threatening the destruction of Boston unless $200,000 was turned over. An impromptu Federal squad was formed to find and deactivate the bomb. (Since even small nuclear arms emit a spectrum of telltale radiations, they can be handy beacons for experts armed with sensitive gear.)
