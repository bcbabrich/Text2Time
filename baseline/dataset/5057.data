ALTHOUGH he has two successful restaurants to his credit, Pino Luongo maintains that the best Italian cooking is found at home.

This former actor - he is the owner of Sapore di Mare, which opened in Wainscott last May, and the creator of the acclaimed Cantinori in Manhattan - has just written ''A Tuscan in the Kitchen'' (Clarkson N. Potter Inc., $24.95) to prove his point.

''The inspiration for a good Tuscan restaurant is home cooking,'' Mr. Luongo says in the introduction to his book. The foods that he knew from childhood in Florence are the ones detailed in this handsome work; they also represent many of the dishes served in his restaurants.

Pappa al pomodoro, a thick, rustic mixture of tomatoes, olive oil, garlic and basil mixed with bread, is typical. The name translates literally as ''tomato pap.''
