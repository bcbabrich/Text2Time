What a long, strange trip it’s been. Well, not really, if we’re honest. It’s been a Milan week without too many surprises, triumphant highs or crushing lows. It’s been Milan on cruise control. The last day is Monday, and it’s a brief one. Those hungering for surprise may have to wait until Paris rolls around.

Still, it ain’t over until the Canadian twins sing — and dance, and occasionally erect a madhouse — at their show for DSquared2. The brother-designers Dean and Dan Caten are known to rev up a party, even with a show that starts at the unfashionably early hour of 9:30 a.m. And this year, they celebrate 20 years in business, a milestone they toasted with a greatest-hits collection and a Mary J. Blige performance at the menswear shows just weeks ago. The week could use a little of their antic cheer.

Then it’s off to Armani, for the second of Maestro Armani’s two Milan shows. We had Emporio Armani on Friday, and Monday big brother Giorgio takes its turn on the catwalk.

After that, it’s bits and pieces, at least as far as most American editors are concerned. A few will stay for Ter et Bantine, the Italian line now in the hands of Kostas Murkudis, a talented German designer who worked with Helmut Lang and was once considered a long-shot possibility to succeed Nicolas Ghesquière at Balenciaga. (He didn’t, but that’s no patch on him; long shots are long shots.)
