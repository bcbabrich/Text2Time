Cecil Fielder, the Yankees' newest high-priced star, was not the most prolific run producer traded last night before the major league trading deadline. The San Diego Padres, seeking a power boost for their pennant run, grabbed Greg Vaughn, one of the American League's primary power hitters this season, from the Milwaukee Brewers.

For Vaughn and a player to be named, the Padres gave the Brewers outfielder Marc Newfield and relief pitchers Ron Villone and Bryce Florie. The Padres acquired Newfield and Villone exactly one year ago from the Seattle Mariners for pitcher Andy Benes.

The Mariners, active again on the last day players could be traded without waivers, picked up their second left-hander in two days. Joining Jamie Moyer as new members of the Mariners' starting rotation will be Terry Mulholland, whom Seattle got from Philadelphia for a minor league shortstop, Desi Relaford.

The Texas Rangers, scrambling to stay ahead of the Mariners in the American League West, tried to bolster their relief corps with the addition of Mike Stanton, a left-hander, getting him from Boston for Mark Brandenburg, a rookie reliever, and Kerry Lacy, a minor league reliever.
