If few women have reached the top levels, it is simply because there are comparatively few women competing, she explains.

Mrs. Ellis, who at 29 owns and operates the Saugatuck Boat Shop in East Norwalk, Conn., and is the mother of a 5month‐old boy, is quick to point out that she and her husband, Arthur, sail as a team. “He takes care of the strategy. He rides the wire and is In a better position to make judgments. My job is to get the boat going through the water as fast as can.”

Yet, she Is annoyed that some of those pushing for separate Olympic racing are a “very vocal collegiate” group. Women collegiate sailors “always have gotten the short end of the stick,” she says. “It wasn't until Title IX that they got equal boats and equal coaching time. Now the younger sailors want instant success but it takes years to develop.

“Those of us who have come up through the ranks know that if you're good enough, you'll succeed. And I'd hate to have that door shut on me just because a few women are afraid to joust with the men.”

And Mrs. Ellis is fearless when comes to accepting challenges.

She remembers the attitude of the men when she competed in the Moth Class world event in Switzerland. “The men would rather drop out than lose to me. If I passed them, they dropped out. had no one sailing behind me.”

She recalls another incident in Europe in which an American woman sailing in the Tempest International called an overlap on a boat rounding a marker. Angered, the male skipper got up and started swinging a paddle at her.

There also have been less hazardous consequences, she says, such as being kept out of a skippers’ meeting at the Riverside Yacht Club because it was held in the “men's only” lounge. Attending a Laser regatta in Bermuda, Mrs. Ellis couldn't go in the front door of the Royal Bermudian Yacht Club because that was reserved for men. And arriving at the New York Yacht Club for a 3:30 P.M. meeting one day, she was told to return at 4 P.M. when women were allowed to enter.
