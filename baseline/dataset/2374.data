SHAPIRO--Pauline. The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing of a cherished, long-time friend who, with her beloved husband, the late Louis Shapiro, was a YU Guardian who gave major support to Yeshiva University. Among their many contributions were the establishment of a large Reading Room in the Mendel Gottesman Library, Scholarship Funds in their honor and in tribute to several friends, and sponsorship of Yeshiva College publications, and of the annual Mishnayos Bekiyus Competition of the YU High School for Boys. Her kindness and compassion, and bravery in the face of adversity, made her a true "Ayshet Chayil". Heartfelt condolences are extended to her children, Martin (and Pat) Shapiro, Harvey Shapiro, Sheila (and Mark) Rosler, her grandchildren, and her great granddaughter. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry J. Weiss, Chairman Board of Trustees
