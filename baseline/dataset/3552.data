As one of the fastest-growing states in the country, Colorado has the traffic problems to prove it. On any given day, almost any given hour, highways are clogged and tempers are frayed. Arriving late has become a way of life.

But Colorado residents have a chance on Tuesday to speed things up, or so say proponents of two ballot initiatives. One would authorize state bond sales to improve highways. The other, for voters in Denver County and five adjacent counties, would expand the light-rail system. Passage of both measures would allow the state to borrow $2.1 billion, which would be repaid with money from the federal highway trust fund.

Recent polls suggest that both measures have about a 60 percent chance of passing. Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican who won election last year after promising to improve traffic conditions, has campaigned for both initiatives.

''I'm cautiously optimistic,'' he said in an interview, reflecting his belief that both measures will pass. ''Historically with these proposals, the voting has narrowed at the end. This time we have more room to maneuver.''
