One more update on the presidential campaign fundraising front: John Edwards, the North Carolina Democrat, raised about $14 million in the first quarter, his campaign reported this afternoon. That is about twice what Mr. Edwards raised when he ran for president in 2004, though it puts him well behind Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who raised $26 million, and almost certainly behind Senator Barack Obama, who is not announcing his number today. Mr. Edwards’ deputy campaign manager, Jonathan Prince, said the campaign was satisfied with the showing and that it exceeded the campaigns’ own budget expectations. (By the way: You can expect EVERY candidate to say first-quarter receipts beat their own internal budget predictions; that’s why they keep them internal).

That said, the fact that Mr. Edwards decided to put out his numbers at a conference call at 5 p.m. today, and under the umbrella of Mrs. Clinton’s announcement earlier in the day, suggests that the campaign wasn’t looking to spotlight this bit of news. “History has clearly indicated that having the most money is not the key to winning the nomination,” Mr. Prince said.

By contrast, aides to Mr. Obama said late Sunday they were definitely not announcing anything today, which was taken in Democratic circles to mean that Mr. Obama is pretty happy with what he is raised compared with Mrs. Clinton (because that is what this is all about) and is looking to have the story to himself when he makes an announcement.

An update to the update: Mr. Obama will have the Democratic stage to himself when he discloses his figure. Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut announced late Sunday that he raised $4 million in the first quarter.
