IN the issue's first day of trading in December, the six million common shares of Hospitality Franchise Systems rose $2.75 from the initial public offering price of $16. And the company, the worldwide franchiser of Days Inn and Howard Johnson and the franchiser of Ramada in the United States, shows no signs of cooling off.

The stock closed Friday at $24 on the New York Stock Exchange, up 37.5 cents. Michael G. Mueller, the lodging industry analyst for Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, said he expected continued high performance.

"I'm projecting earnings of $1.16 in calendar 1993 and going to $1.45 in 1994," Mr. Mueller said. That projection assumes little or no improvement in occupancy and room rates. "If you assume occupancy up 2 points and room rates up 3 percent," Mr. Mueller said, "and assume they add 30,000 rooms to the system instead of 17,000, the company earns $1.68."

Mr. Mueller's forecast is based on three main considerations: the company has continued to add rooms aggressively; it generates sizable excess cash flow and has minimal capital spending requirements, and it will benefit from the expiration of many royalty rates that the previous management discounted to attract franchisees. These rates are the fees, based on a percentage of revenue, that franchisees pay to the company.
