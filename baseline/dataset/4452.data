IT is always worthwhile to inspect the outside of a house in early spring each year to check for winter damage, but after this year's unusually severe winter, a thorough spring inspection could be especially valuable.

An inspection need not be completed in a single session. In fact, by making small repairs as you proceed, you can often avert catastrophes like roof and basement leaks, and can perform regular maintenance that otherwise might be neglected.

Start your inspection by checking the gutters and downspouts; functioning correctly, these are crucial in preventing foundation leaks. If you can, observe them during a heavy rain so you can spot areas that overflow, which is an indication of blockage, misaligned sections, gaps or damage. Clear or repair gutters as soon as weather permits. Work by standing on a ladder, not by climbing onto the roof, which can invite a fall.

Also make sure splash blocks (concrete or plastic troughs), hoses or other drainage devices are placed or attached beneath all downspouts and are clear of debris. These items direct runoff away from the foundation and minimize erosion caused by the water's impact. Most drainage items are available at home centers.
