MERIDIAN, Miss., Nov. 30â€”Civil rights workers, harassed and unwanted in this eastern Mississippi city, befriended a lonely sailor from New York, and as a result the small band of visitors is now involved in an incident that could wreck the movement here.

Eight white young men and women, almost the entire staff of the Council of Federated Organizations project here, were rounded up last week when the police found in the council's office a portable record player that they said had been stolen by the sailor from, a local apartment.

The sailor, Vincent Cummuskey, 18 years old, of 115-10: 221st Street, St. Albans, Queens, is in jail charged with burglary. Held with him are two civil rights workers, Sandra Watts, 22, a school teacher from Lakeview, Ore., and Joseph M.Morse of Dakota, Minn. Six other council staff members have been freed.

Mr. Morse, who according to his friends is studying for the priesthood, was charged with receiving stolen property. Miss Watts was charged with being an accessory after the fact of burglary. The police said she was with Mr. Cummuskey when he committed a theft.
