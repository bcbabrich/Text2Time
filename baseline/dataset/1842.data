The big guy behind the desk knows he could have been named John F. Rivera. Instead, his parents, entranced by the promise of Camelot, named him Kennedy Rivera. It has a noble sound now, though less so when he was growing up in 1960s Brooklyn.

“They gave me a hard time in public school,” he said. “They would ask me, ‘Didn’t they kill you?’”

No, he’s still around. He lives and works in Bushwick — or East Williamsburg as some exiles from the South Side insist on calling it. His work is to ensure that he and other tenants on modest incomes can stay living in the neighborhood. He is a housing specialist with Bushwick Housing Independence, a nonprofit group that by its own account takes on 30 clients a month fighting eviction by landlords eager to rent to younger, hipper and better-off tenants.



In recent months the group has tried helping tenants in some of the worst-looking (and smelling) buildings in town. At 665 Central Avenue, the subject of a Citywide column in January about the city’s housing policy for homeless families, the landlord finally plastered the holes in the hallway walls, and painted them over a clean, Pepto-Bismol pink.

Apartments that had been used as hangouts by knucklehead teenagers have been sealed shut with some serious-looking plywood and two-by-fours.

Mr. Rivera and Kathy Maire, a Roman Catholic nun who has been in charge of the housing group in recent months while its founder, Msgr. John Powis, was on sick leave, convened a meeting last Thursday between the tenants and the building’s managing agent. It did not go smoothly.

“One tenant said her kid had homicidal tendencies,” Mr. Rivera recounted.

“The mother said if you gave the kid a knife and told him to hurt somebody he’d do it,” Sister Maire said.

“And he was sitting right there!” Mr. Rivera said.

“I suggested why not put him on medication,” Sister Maire continued. “His mother said he was already on meds and was still getting thrown out of school.”

Another tenant grew testy when he felt his neighbors were going to turn on him for having too many guests drop by the building. He stormed out, Sister Maire said. By the end of the meeting, she said, the managing agent offered to pay some tenants to move out.

“I can’t blame him,” Sister Maire said. “If he is willing to pay them to get out of the building, why not? This group is too volatile. If there is any chance to salvage this building, they cannot do it while this crowd is there.”

Mr. Rivera knows that in his line of work, not all tenants are on the side of the angels. And some folks, in fact, might want to send him to the angels.

“They try to intimidate me to back off,” he said. “Oh, you work at St. Barbara’s church, someone told me. Then they started talking about pall bearers. They said they knew where I was at. I get afraid, but it doesn’t stop me.”

That’s because the complaints from tenants don’t stop.

“I’m usually the first one to go out and check,” he said. “I know the area well. I guess I’m the biggest one, too.”

The only assault he had to worry about recently at 64 Troutman Street was the one on his nose. A stench that smelled like foot funk, mold and garbage had him reeling in the hallway. The older tenants in this half-empty six-unit building just off the elevated train line have been frantic since December, when construction caught them by surprise.

Mr. Rivera has been working closely with these tenants, after they grew upset over their Christmas present: the owner ripped out the stairs between the first and second floors, replaced them with quickly built plywood ones, and tossed the debris into a pile inside a vacant first-floor apartment.

Last week, while Mr. Rivera and Sister Maire were trying to resolve the problems at 665 Central Avenue, the Troutman Street tenants found themselves without heat or hot water. There was, however, stench aplenty. Upstairs, the plaster from one wall on a vacant apartment has been ripped away, leaving the exposed beams looking like prison bars penning in an ankle-high pile of plaster, wood and nails.

The Department of Buildings has no open violations for this address. It does have a valid permit for bathroom and kitchen renovations, with no mention of stairway replacement. The Department of Housing Preservation and Development lists 73 open violations at that address, including ones for the debris inside the first floor apartment.

A man who identified himself only as Mr. Heskel, the building manager, said the owner had to replace the old stairs with temporary ones because they were in poor condition. He insisted there was nothing wrong with putting the debris inside the apartment, rather than carting it away.

“We didn’t have enough to put it in a container,” he said. “Nobody has called me about a smell. What do you mean it smells? I closed the door. What’s the big deal?”

He said the owner would be restoring heat and completing repairs in the coming days.

This is news to the tenants in the building, who feel they are being not-so-gently encouraged to leave.

A portrait of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. hangs in the hallway outside of Katrine Jessup’s second-floor apartment. Below it is inscribed, “I Have A Dream.” Considering the looks and smell of the hallway downstairs, it must be a bad one.

“They’ve done nothing except tear down the stairs,” said Ms. Jessup, 67. Her own apartment is spotless. It is also cold, save for the heat from the stove.

“They have been trying to clear people out,” said her son, Ron, who comes by to help. “The landlord said he would work with us. But it’s gotten worse and worse.”

On March 16, he said, another man came by the building offering to pay tenants two years rent to leave. He wrote down his “good will offer” of a rent-stabilized apartment elsewhere, moving expenses and two years rent. Mr. Jessup said the man insisted that no lawyers get involved. The tenants said they had the impression the man, Wolfe Landau, was the new landlord.

Not yet, at least according to Mr. Landau.

“I’m just looking to buy the building,” he said. “I wanted to buy the building from my friend and vacate it.”
