As secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice does not spend much time inside school hallways. But there she was Monday morning, standing in the auditorium of Community School 154 in Harlem, alongside Congressman Charles Rangel.

The secretary and the veteran Democratic congressman made a bit of an odd couple in a somewhat curious location at the elementary school, which is in his district, just steps from his local office.

“You may ask, well, why am I here?” Ms. Rice said to the students and teachers assembled in the auditorium, as though she sensed skepticism.

But to hear her explain it, the success of schools is as much a part of national security as, say, negotiations with the Iraqi government.

This was about “the importance of education to making us a country that is confident and not fearful about our future, but that has a real sense of hope and promise for each and every child.”

Mr. Rangel’s aides said he asked Ms. Rice to visit the successful school after the two talked about education earlier this summer. With Mr. Rangel and Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein looking on in admiration, Ms. Rice spoke to the students about her own life and her continued amazement that she could go from growing up in segregated Alabama to the halls of power in Washington.

“One thing that I want you to promise me is that you won’t let anybody else tell you what it is you ought to be interested in,” Ms. Rice said. “You’ll find what you are interested in and you’ll pursue it and you won’t let anyone say ‘Why would you want to be interested in that? You’re from Harlem.’.”

As the morning event ended, students lined up on stage to ask her questions.

“Will you run for president?” one student asked.

Ms. Rice responded with a bit of an embarrassed laugh and a direct answer: “I don’t think I’m the kind of person who would run for president.”

Mr. Rangel grabbed the microphone and exclaimed, “You missed your chance to make big news today!”
