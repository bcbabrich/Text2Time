Shilstone and Newton said Reyes could require a variety of treatments, including therapeutic stretching designed to break down scar tissue that may have built up in his right hamstring. They would also instruct him to build up his quadriceps and train him to run in a way that reduces pressure on his hamstrings.

Players who strain their hamstring once are considered more apt to do it repeatedly. Reyes and the Mets were optimistic last week that he would be able to return by the end of the exhibition season, but he felt pain in his hamstring while running Sunday. Afterward, Manager Art Howe said Reyes was ''very iffy'' for opening day. The Mets gave Reyes only a 24-hour break, then let him take light batting practice Tuesday.

During a more vigorous batting practice session Wednesday, Reyes tried to pull the ball from the left side of the plate. When he felt pain in his hamstring, he called for a trainer. Moments later, Reyes was sent back to hit from the right side, experienced more pain, and took himself out. ''When I try to pull the ball, I feel something,'' Reyes said.

The Mets were only slightly encouraged that Reyes was able to take a light jog Wednesday evening.

The Mets' starting second baseman on opening day is likely to be Ricky Gutierrez, whom they acquired from the Cleveland Indians on Sunday for a player to be named. ''It's a pretty weird situation,'' Gutierrez said. ''They haven't told me anything, but I'll be able to fill in.''

Having switched from shortstop to second base in the off-season to accommodate Kazuo Matsui, Reyes has not played a game with Matsui this spring. Matsui lacerated his right middle finger Feb. 29 and strained his right wrist on Sunday.

Meanwhile, Reyes fell farther from the field. Duquette maintained that the Mets were satisfied with Reyes's rehabilitation schedule, were soliciting outside opinions from sports performance experts and could send Reyes to a specialist.

But for now, it seems as if the future of the Mets will have to wait.

INSIDE PITCH

Fighting flulike symptoms, GRANT ROBERTS had his worst outing of the spring, allowing seven runs in five innings and confusing the race for the fifth starting pitcher's spot. The Mets lost their fourth game in a row, 11-5, to the Dodgers as TY WIGGINTON was ejected and MIKE PIAZZA was inconsistent at first base. . . . TYLER YATES will pitch again Sunday, signaling that he is still in the race for a spot in the starting rotation. Yates pitched three innings in a Class AAA game Wednesday, giving up two runs. . . . JAMES BALDWIN said he had outstanding stuff Wednesday in a Class AA game, but he gave up five runs in six innings. . . . Tampa Bay's player development and scouting assistant, MITCH LUKEVICS, and the Boston Red Sox vice president of baseball operations, MIKE PORT, were in town to be interviewed for for the Mets' vacant assistant general manager position. . . . BILL PULSIPHER, the former Mets pitcher now with the Long Island Ducks independent team, worked out at the Mets' spring training complex.
