On Saturday morning the Russian K.H.L. announced that it would stage a full replay of the Dinamo-Ak Bars match disrupted Thursday by smoke from flares set off by fans inside Moscow’s Luzhniki Arena, which resulted in that game being suspended after one period with the score tied 1-1. The league ruled that Dinamo would have to pay all expenses for Ak Bars to return to Moscow from Kazan for the Jan. 13 replay, and that the game would be replayed from the beginning with all of Thursday’s statistics annulled. K.H.L. vice president Vladimir Shalaev said that the police were looking for the “hooligans” who set off the flares and that Dinamo had accepted league fines totaling 300,000 rubles, or about $11,000.
