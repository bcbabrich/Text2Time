SPOKANE, Wash. — Rick Santorum implied Thursday night that he had won the primary on Tuesday in Michigan, where he actually lost the popular vote to Mitt Romney and, as of now, is behind him in delegates.

He did not mention the controversy over the delegates that had sprung up overnight after the Michigan Republican Party changed its rules and, instead of awarding an equal number of delegates to both candidates as expected, gave two additional delegates to Mr. Romney, who won the popular vote with 41 percent compared with Mr. Santorum’s 38 percent.

The Santorum campaign on Thursday accused the state party of “thuggery” for changing the delegate rules after the election. It has asked the Republican National Committee to intervene.

Mr. Santorum, speaking to a crowd of a few hundred people at a megachurch here in advance of the Washington caucuses on Saturday, said he had an equal number of delegates and implied that he had won Michigan — at least started winning after Feb. 7, when he won three other contests and voters in Michigan who were casting absentee ballots realized he could be elected. (He has offered no evidence to support that conclusion.)

“From the time that we won Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri,” he said, “from that point on, we won the vote” in Michigan. “There were absentee ballots filed before that, but from that point on, we won the vote. Once people looked at our record and his record, once people looked at who was the fighter that’s going to go out and charge Washington and change Washington, the folks in Michigan voted for Rick Santorum. And we came out of Michigan with the same number of delegates as Governor Romney did – not bad in his home state.”

The Santorum campaign had said on Wednesday that it expected to win half the 30 delegates in the state, which awards its delegates on a proportional basis by Congressional district. But on Wednesday night, the Michigan Republican Party’s Credentials Committee voted 4-to-2 to award two at-large delegates to Mr. Romney, giving him a 16-14 delegate advantage.

On Feb. 4, the committee had approved a procedure that would have awarded the at-large delegates equally. But Saul Anuzis, the former state Republican chairman who is a member of the committee and supports Mr. Romney, said in a statement that a memo about how the delegates would be awarded contained an error.

The committee’s intention, he said, was not to award the two at-large delegates proportionally but to give them both to the winner of the statewide popular vote: Mr. Romney.

“While we all regret the error in the memo,” Mr. Anuzis said, “it does not change what was voted on by the committee, which was to award the two at-large delegates to the statewide winner.”

Although he did not discuss that dispute during his half-hour speech here in Spokane, for which he was an hour late, the rule change seems to have added to his already palpable sense of grievance against the Republican establishment.

In Iowa in January, Mr. Santorum actually won the caucuses, but because of miscounts, Mr. Romney was initially declared the winner. Mr. Santorum has said that not being perceived immediately as the winner and not being able to deliver a victory speech when so many people were watching had denied him subsequent momentum.

On Thursday night, he portrayed himself as an insurgent candidate going up against the establishment, a David against Goliath.

“We are running, we’re getting outspent everywhere by five, six, seven to one,” he said. “All the big-money guys, spending huge amounts of money, and anytime you punch back, oh, they get all upset. ‘Oh, he’s unfair. He called eligible voters and asked them to vote in Michigan.’ Wow.”

Mr. Santorum was referring to his campaign’s urging of Democrats in Michigan to vote in the Republican primary, which some analysts bemoaned as mischievous but which Mr. Santorum defended.

Mr. Romney was “out there telling lie after lie after lie,” Mr. Santorum said, without specifying what he meant, “and I went out and actually asked eligible voters to vote and that’s ‘unfair.’ ”

“Folks, this is the establishment. They don’t like getting into the fight, they just like having the money advantage and having their way.”

He planned one more rally in Washington State before heading back Friday to Ohio, the most important of the 10 states that vote on Super Tuesday next week.
