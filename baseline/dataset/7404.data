WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 —Miguel José Moreno Jr. put to the test here today the forensic skill he acquired in this capital nearly a quarter of a century ago. As his country's Ambassador to the Organization of American States and chief Panamanian Negotiator in the Canal Zone dis‐pute with Washington, Mr. Moreno's task this afternoon was to charge the United States with ag‐gression and to mate his case convincing.

It is perhaps ironical under the present circumstances that Mr. Moreno learned the law here in Washington. He earned a degree from Georgetown University when he served as second secretary of the Panamanian Embassy in the nineteen‐thirties. He and his colleagues were able then to celebrate the first revision o,f the 1963 Canal Zone Treaty.

Thus Mr. Moreno, now 49 years old — he was born on April 3, 1914—has been associated from his youngman‐hood with both the United States and the problem of the canal. Such experience and such a background are characteristic of many Panamanians in high positions. This reflects the intricate relationship between Panama's nationalism and her special ties with the United States.

Mr. Moreno is a nationalist in the sense that is shared by Panamanians of all political and special groups. This nationalism increasingly imimplies a resentment of the United States’ sway over the canal.
