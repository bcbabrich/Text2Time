Today's KEY GAMES

NO. 4 TEXAS 10-1

NO. 5 vs. COLORADO 9-2

Instead of the projected matchup of Nebraska and Oklahoma in the Big 12 championship game, it's Texas against Colorado. A week ago, Colorado routed Nebraska, 62-36, with 582 yards of offense, and now quarterback Bobby Pesavento says he will be ready despite an injured throwing shoulder. But Texas overran Colorado, 41-7, six weeks ago, and its versatile offense should help keep the Longhorns in the national championship race.Ch.7, 8 p.m.

NO. 3 Tennessee 9-1

NO. 2 at florida 9-1

The winner will become the champion of the Southeastern Conference East and play in the championship game next Saturday against Louisiana State or Auburn. If Florida wins today and next week, it seems sure to reach the Bowl Championship Series title game. The Gators, even without tailback Earnest Graham (sprained right knee), remain explosive. Tennessee can be explosive, too, but not this time.

Ch.2, 4:30 p.m.

NO. 1 MIAMI10-0

NO. 23 at VA. TECH8-2

In its last two games, Miami humiliated two ranked teams: Syracuse by 59-0 and Washington by 65-7. Only a disaster can keep Miami out of the B.C.S. championship game, and Virginia Tech, despite its aggresive defense, does not seem to be a spoiler. Tech's consolation will be a Gator Bowl meeting with Florida State.Ch.7, 1 p.m.

OREGON STATE 5-5

NO. 7 at OREGON 9-1

If Oregon wins, it is hoping to remain alive for a national title shot. More likely is a Fiesta Bowl bid. Beware of Oregon State, which had been considered a national title contender in the preseason. Oregon quarterback Joey Harrington is looking to boost his Heisman candidacy.Ch.7, 4:30 p.m.
