DEAR DIARY:

The passenger elevator in our building is undergoing a total overhaul, so we're forced to use the service elevator. It's amazing how this small change harkens one back to a simpler time. I hate to admit it, but I'm hoping the repair takes longer than expected.

There's a certain civility to being taken swiftly and directly to your floor. The operator almost takes pride in remembering where you're going. He's quick to make small talk, and we all seem quick to make it back. If you're just going down to the basement to do laundry, the operator will sometimes stay and wait for you. If someone is in a hurry, he'll bypass a stop or two to get that person home all the quicker.

And the change in the building is remarkable. Whereas before we just stared at the numbers, hoping that no one would break the silence, people now seem quick to converse on the elevator, talking about where they've come from or where they're going, the weather outside.

Perhaps it's the novelty of the experience, but I'd like to think it's a process of being conjoined by this silly lift, carrying us from floor to floor. Before, we were separated by the sterile technology of the automatic elevator. Now, we're connected by the human presence on the lift. For a while at least, it's almost as if we live in one big apartment. Gino DiIorio
