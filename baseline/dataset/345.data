When the Liberty traded for center Kia Vaughn in January, Coach Bill Laimbeer knew there was a caveat.

Vaughn did not have a history of balky knees or a penchant for controversy. She has been quite the opposite for much of her nine-year career: a team leader and a stabilizing presence in the lane.

But Vaughn did have a passport from the Czech Republic, signaling her commitment to its national team. That includes playing in the EuroBasket tournament in Prague and Hradec Kralove, and leaving behind the Liberty for most of June.

“It’s very hard,” said Vaughn, a New York native. “It got harder when I got traded home.”

Vaughn’s Czech citizenship “opens up other doors for me business-wise,” she said. “As a professional, you want to open up as many doors as you can for as long as you can. I’m not sure when my career will come to an end.”
