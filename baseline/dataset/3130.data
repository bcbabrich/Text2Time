Ever since a knife-wielding man killed eight children at an elementary school near Osaka on June 8, schools across Japan have wasted little time adopting security measures that until the stabbing would have been unthinkable in a country of little violence.

School officials have locked gates, posted guards, organized parent patrols, installed cameras and enrolled teachers in self-defense courses.

Some schools are even arming teachers with weapons like ear-splitting noise alarms, long Y-shaped poles (often used by the police to subdue suspects) and canisters of tear gas.

Hideki Matsuzaki, the mayor of Urayasu, a town east of Tokyo, said, ''It might look dangerous for schools to have such devices, but what should not have happened did actually happen in Ikeda, and the city government should consider concrete measures to keep children safe.'' Urayasu plans to distribute tear-gas canisters to 42 schools.
