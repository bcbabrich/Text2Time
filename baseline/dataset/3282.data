Yesterday morning at the Convent Avenue Baptist Church, the Rev. Clarence Harding urged his congregation members to put their emotional well-being into the Lord's hands.

A few minutes later, a social worker told church members that if that didn't work, they might try Zoloft.

Like most other Sunday mornings at the Harlem church, the pews were packed with men in sharp suits and women in stylish dresses and colorful wide-brimmed hats. Many fanned themselves or waved their hands as the choir sang ''At the Cross'' and Mr. Harding preached that despair can be cured by ''accepting God's promise.''

But then Dr. David Nganele, whose company runs a monthly health clinic at the church, urged members of the congregation who ''feel anxious over Lent'' to stick around for a mental health seminar with ''the folks from Pfizer.''
