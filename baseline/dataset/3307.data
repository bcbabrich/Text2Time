For more than a year, a special grand jury under Mr. Catterson's direction has investigated allegations of wrongdoing in Sheriff Mahoney's department, including charges that the sheriff pressured correction officers and deputy sheriffs into making political contributions to him in exchange for promotions. In February, investigators took several files, computers and a list of contributors from the sheriff's office.

An official close to the grand jury proceedings said he believed that the sheriff would face anywhere from 60 to 150 counts of official misconduct and abuse of power.

Sheriff Mahoney's lawyer, William D. Wexler, said today that a representative from the district attorney's office called him Monday afternoon, asking that the sheriff be brought to Mr. Catterson at 9:30 this morning. But early today, Mr. Wexler said, he received another phone call saying the appointment would be pushed back to next Tuesday. ''This usually means an arrest, mug shots, fingerprints, then an appearance before the judge and the unsealing of the indictments,'' Mr. Wexler said. ''When the D.A.'s office asks you to come in, it's usually not for lunch.''

The indictments are the latest salvo in a long battle between the county's top law enforcement officers. Over the years, Sheriff Mahoney and Mr. Catterson have made direct and oblique references to Hitler, Jimmy Hoffa and Lee Harvey Oswald when talking about each other.

The feud goes back at least as far as 1993, when Mr. Catterson felt that the sheriff had upstaged him after Katie Beers, a 10-year-old who was kidnapped and held in a dungeon for 16 days, was found alive. Sheriff Mahoney had refused to turn the girl over to Mr. Catterson, who had the international press convened on the steps of the county courthouse.
