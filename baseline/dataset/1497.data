For many, Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting is something like a Woodstock for capitalists. Thousands flock from around the globe to Omaha to listen to Berkshire’s chief executive, Warren E. Buffett, expound on the world at large, and this year is no exception.

DealBook has gathered some shots of the goings-on at the Berkshire meeting, including the lighter moments that Mr. Buffett is known to indulge in. (Chief among them, as always: playing his ukulele and snacking on frozen treats from Dairy Queen, one of his favorite repasts.)
