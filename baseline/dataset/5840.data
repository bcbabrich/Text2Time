On Wednesday Admiral Watkins went down the hall to see John F. Lehman Jr., the Secretary of the Navy, about the week's developments. An aide says the admiral takes pains to make sure ''there are no surprises'' to Mr. Lehman, his civilian superior. 'The Local Truth'

Admiral Watkins also met recently with 20 of the Navy's master chief petty officers, the senior noncommissioned officers. ''They gave me an earful,'' he said. ''What they say may not be the absolute truth, but it's the local truth. You must listen to them because they are the most honest people in the world.''

A good part of Admiral Watkins's time is spent showing the flag. He presided at the retirement ceremony of a senior surface officer to express interest in surface sailors and attended the medical officers' ball Saturday night. The admiral also went to a gathering of aviators recently, which was like walking into the lion's den since he is a submariner.

Dealing with other Government departments, politics and diplomacy were also on last week's agenda. Lieut. Gen. John T. Chain Jr. of the Air Force, who is director of political/military affairs at the State Department, came to discuss Lebanon and other current issues.

Senator Daniel K. Inouye and others in the Hawaii Congressional delegation came to urge the Navy to give up land in their state. On Wednesday the admiral went to a reception given by Senator John Tower, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee, for Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, senior Democrat on the panel.

On Monday night the admiral talked at dinner with the Japanese Defense Minister, Yuko Kurihara, about an exercise in which Japanese and American crews trained together. On Tuesday and Wednesday he met with the Colombian Chief of Naval Operations, Vice Adm. Tito Garcia. On Thursday he dropped in at a reception for the Swiss Ambassador and went to dinner at the Chinese Embassy. On Friday he attended a reception for foreign naval attaches stationed here. 3 Afternoons in the 'Tank'

Admiral Watkins usually goes into the ''tank,'' as the meeting room of the Joint Chiefs is known, on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday afternoons for conferences of two to four hours. Deputies have argued out most questions beforehand so ''we get the tough issues,'' the admiral said. These have included questions of arms negotiations with the Soviet Union, basing of the MX missile, deploying troops to Lebanon, dispatching ships to the Persian Gulf and, perhaps toughest of all, reorganizing the Joint Chiefs.
