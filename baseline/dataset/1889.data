Although I had been writing about food for several years before going to New York magazine, nothing took off quite the way it did once I started working for Clay Felker.

For one thing, he realized the value of service pieces and respected them. Before that they were considered a sort of dirty, commercial kind of journalism, if indeed the word was even applicable. He once told me: “More people care about finding a great brownie than about most world affairs. They can do something direct about the brownie, but not much about the rest.”

What made it such fun to work there was the in-your-face tone the magazine took, the fact that it was an upstart, and that there was such great talent. Most of all, though, writers could say there what could not be said in most any other publication at the time, something that made us all willing to work almost for nothing. That was fortunate because that is just about what we were paid. But what a showcase!



Clay also knew when to clear the decks at the last moment to accommodate a great piece. When I wrote, “I Tasted Everything in Bloomingdale’s Food Department” — something that took me 11 months to do — he had me report individually on 1,196 items, killing some other pieces he had planned to run.

He also had a great way of inspiring young writers, as I saw when I spoke at one of his classes in magazine development at Berkeley, where he could play devil’s advocate to get students thinking.

Clay could talk himself into very strange, fixed ideas that he defended loudly and aggressively. One day, during an argument with someone, he declared that Catholics can’t cook. Seeing me in the office, he said, “Let’s ask Mimi.”

When I answered, “Catholics? You mean like the French and the Italians?” he stopped talking to me for two weeks. But as far as I know, I had not changed his mind.

Before serving as food critic of The Times, from 1975 to 1983, Mimi Sheraton was a contributing writer at New York magazine from 1970 to 1975. A Brooklyn native and New York University graduate, she has also written written on food and travel for numerous other publications, including Seventeen, Time, Smart Money, Harper’s Bazaar, Vogue, The Village Voice, Vanity Fair, Esquire and Mademoiselle. Her most recent book is “Eating My Words: An Appetite For Life” (William Morrow, 2004). She has lived in Greenwich Village for more than 60 years.
