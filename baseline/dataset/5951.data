The New York Philharmonic has become the Shirley Verrett Show the last few weeks. Miss Verrett, the American soprano, sang her own set of concerts for subscription listeners last week, and Friday afternoon she replaced another soprano, Montserrat Caballe, who has been ill and was unable to appear.

Aside from accompanying Miss Verrett - which they did very well - Zubin Mehta and the Philharmonic limited themselves to two overtures, the Brahms ''Tragic'' (Op.81) and the Szymanowski Concert Overture (Op.12). The Brahms was hard-driven and tensely played, while the Szymanowski - given in celebration of the composer's centenary - was notable for its screaming brass, great gusting fortissimos and its contrasting string sections, which sighed and groaned in their late Romantic splendor. In short, it was music supremely loud and enthusiastically vulgar. Both performances were beautifully coordinated and constituted orchestra playing of high virtuosity. Indeed, this is music that Mr. Mehta performs perhaps better than any other conductor.

Miss Verrett repeated the Chausson ''Poeme de l'Amour'' that she sang last week. She added two arias by Massenet - ''Pleurez, pleurez, mes yeux'' from ''Le Cid'' and ''Il est doux, il est bon'' from ''Herodiade.''

Miss Verrett - beautiful as ever and dramatically spotlighted on stage - seemed almost to overstate the case in Chausson's delicately evocative music; but in the two Massenet pieces she was absolutely splendid. The style was grand and the voice equally so. It was one of those instances where virtuoso singing technique and dramatic expression seemed to merge one into the other. The usually subdued Friday audience was loudly enthusiastic at the end.
