"Clinton is getting desperate," Mr. Brown said, speaking on his way into a meeting with the editorial board of The Daily News. Earlier, he said, Mr. Clinton had rejected his call for more frequent debates, "but now he gets into trouble and wants to have them. Maybe that's progress."

"This is not a campaign against Clinton," Mr. Brown added. "This is a campaign to make justice the watchword of American politics. So there." At last night's debate, Mr. Brown was applauded several times when he urged the country to make a "moral commitment" to rebuilding the inner city.

Yet despite Mr. Clinton's call for six debates, and Mr. Brown's apparent acquiesence, it was unclear yesterday when or even whether they would actually take place. Clinton campaign staff members said yesterday's meeting with mayors counted as one debate, and the debate last night at Lehman College in the Bronx counted as another. Another debate is planned for Sunday morning at the WNBC-TV studio in Manhattan, and a fourth encounter is scheduled for Monday on the "Donahue" program on NBC. As for the other two, aides to both Mr. Brown and Mr. Clinton said these had yet to be scheduled. Indications of Tight Race

The Clinton camp's newfound enthusiasm for debates is a clear reflection of mounting worries at campaign headquarters. Aides to Governor Clinton say their private polls show the race in New York to be close. And although it is unclear whether the campaign is accurately representing its polls, or simply using them to dampen expectations, independent polls also suggest that the race could be tight.

A poll published on Tuesday in The Buffalo News shows that 40 percent of New York Democrats favor Mr. Clinton, 34 percent favor Mr. Brown and 26 percent say they are undecided. The poll, which has a margin of sampling error of five percentage points, was conducted March 27-29.

Mr. Clinton's strategy for countering bad news in New York with debates that limit the influence of the press is similar to the one he tried in New Hampshire before that state's primary on Feb. 18. When accusations of marital infidelity and manipulation of his draft status sent his polls sagging, Mr. Clinton bought half-hour blocks of television time and staged his own forums with voters. Twists of Logic

Aides to the Governor said yesterday that they had looked into buying such television time in New York as well, but had rejected the idea as impractical because of costs and scheduling.
