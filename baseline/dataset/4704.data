Bob Quinn, dismissed in October as the Cincinnati Reds' general manager, will be named general manager of the San Francisco Giants today, a person familiar with the new ownership's search said last night.

Quinn, who was the Yankees' general manager for a year and a half in 1988-89, was not at his Cincinnati home. He was said to be traveling to San Francisco for a news conference the Giants announced for today.

Al Rosen resigned as the Giants' president and general manager Nov. 20, saying he wanted to clear the way for the new owners to name their own executives. The ownership group, which officially will take over the team at the closing of the $100 million sale Jan. 6, is headed by Peter Magowan, president of Safeway.

The new ownership also is expected to replace Roger Craig as manager. Dusty Baker, a Giants coach the last five seasons, is considered the leading candidate for the job.
