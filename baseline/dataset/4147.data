The better part of three decades ago, when Thomas Cuevas was an ambitious businessman in his late 20's, Julio Pabon was a teen-ager and the Bronx was a borough in decline, Mr. Cuevas opened 310 1/2, a South Bronx nightclub that became a focal point of the Latin music scene.

"In the South Bronx in that period, there was no place for young people to hang out and stay out of trouble," Mr. Pabon, now 43, said. "But he just charged $3 to get in and he welcomed everybody. He gave dancers and musicians a break and he let them practice there. He hired guys who were in gangs to paint the place and be security guards."

Yesterday, five days after Mr. Cuevas, 55, was killed in what was apparently a robbery, old friends and people who had never met exchanged similar stories about him at Park Abbey Funeral Chapel in the Parkchester section of the Bronx. Hundreds of people, from gang members to legislators, filed past the body of Mr. Cuevas and paid their respects to his daughter, Debra, 29, and his son, Thomas Jr., 21.

At Park Abbey and the other mortuaries that line Unionport Road, the passing of private lives is most often noted in private grief, but the gathering for Mr. Cuevas was as open as his life had been. Mourners spilled down a hall, into an unused room nearby and onto the sidewalks, where they lingered in groups under a slate sky, their collars turned up to ward off a drizzle. They shared memories of "Tommy," talking invariably about his smile, his love of dancing and salsa music, and his unflagging will to help people.
