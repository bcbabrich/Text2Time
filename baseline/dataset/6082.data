Thunderstorms with heavy rain squalls and salvos of lightning danced over the Ne,v York metropolitan area yesterday afternoon, slowing homebound traffic and knocking out electric power briefly in nearly 17.000 homes and busihesses in parts of the city and suburbs.

The storms moved into the metropolitan area about 2:30 P.M. and continued into the early evening. The National Weather Service said about a half‐inch of rain fell in New York City. most of in the first hour, and temperatures dropped sharply from the mid‐SO's to the low 70's.

There were numerous, scattered problems for public utilities. High winds and pounding rains felled tree limbs that severed overhead power lines in Staten Island and Westchester and Rockland Counties. Lightning strikes were blamed for other power failures, and short circuits on transmission lines were said to have led to other blackouts.

Rockland County was the hardest hit. A total of 5,700 customers of the Orange and Rockland Utilities, principally in Haverstraw, Tappan, Mount Ivy, Suffern and Pomona, were left without power for periods ranging up to two hours. Some of the utility's customers in Bergen County in northern New Jersey also were affected.
