The new tools inevitably conjure up "Fantastic Voyage," the 1960's science-fiction thriller in which a medical team was shrunk and launched into a patient's bloodstream in a cell-size submarine to wipe out a blood clot in the victim's brain. Indeed, Dr. Aaron J. Fleischman, co-director of the laboratory that Cleveland Clinic set up five years ago to provide researchers with engineering support for very small-scale devices, said that doctors initially asked him when he would start building tiny intelligent submarines -- minus the shrunken crew, of course.

While researchers do discuss the feasibility of making tiny robotic devices able to maneuver inside the body and perform a variety of tasks, most current research and new product development is focused on nano-scale particles.

Quantum dots, metallic particles that emit bright light in a color range that varies with their size, are now frequently used to study tumors and locate proteins that researchers want to study. By attaching antibodies that prefer to bind with specific types of cells to dots of different sizes, the researchers can get a multicolored image showing the location and concentration of many elements inside a tissue sample.

Nanoparticles may help researchers overcome obstacles in gene therapy, which seeks to treat genetically inherited diseases like cystic fibrosis by implanting healthy genes to do the work of damaged ones.

Nanoparticles may also be used to deliver heat to cancer cells to kill them. MagForce Technologies, based in Berlin, coats iron oxide nanoparticles with a compound that is a nutrient for tumor cells, which then ingest the particles. When an external magnetic field causes the particles to vibrate rapidly, the tumor cells are killed and then flushed from the body by its natural scavenger cells, according to MagForce's research results.

MagForce expects regulatory approval to sell the particles and its treatment machinery in Germany in 2006 after more extensive clinical trials have been completed. A German insurer has already agreed to reimburse hospitals there for the technology, based on early results, according to Dr. Andreas Jordan, the company's chief executive. Dr. Jordan said he was negotiating with large American equipment vendors in hopes of finding a partner big enough to cope with the costs of getting regulatory and reimbursement approval in the United States.

Business issues aside, researchers say, nanotechnology in medicine faces so many technical hurdles that long delays and numerous failures are inevitable. "The complexity of biology is clearly beyond our comprehension at this time," said Dr. James R. Baker Jr., director of the Center for Biologic Nanotechnology at the University of Michigan. "That's why so many drugs fail."
