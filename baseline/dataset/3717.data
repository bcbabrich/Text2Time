Madison Avenue Against AIDS

Puck Building, 295 Lafayette Street (Houston Street); (212) 836-1281.

Forget floral vases. The goods will be new, upscale and very hip on Oct. 8, when 23 advertising agencies hold a gala yard sale and auction to benefit AIDS charities.

Unlike some other creative industries -- fashion and entertainment, for instance -- advertising has been slow to organize fund-raising for AIDS, said Richard Kirshenbaum, a co-founder of Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners. ''Advertising agencies are always so competitive with each other. This gives us an opportunity to work together.''

Each participating agency at the event, called the Madison Avenue Sellout, has a booth. The sale, which includes donations from clients, will benefit the UJA-Federation AIDS Initiative, God's Love We Deliver and H.E.L.P./Project Samaritan. The products in the Kirshenbaum Bond booth include Sony stereo systems and a year of flowers delivered from 1-800-Flowers.

''The auction items tend to be the bigger-ticket things,'' Mr. Kirshenbaum said, ''like a week at a five-bedroom, ocean-front house in Cabos San Lucas, Mexico.'' There will also be round-trip tickets to Paris, 120,000 frequent-flier miles on T.W.A. and a one-year lease on a Volvo S70 sedan.
