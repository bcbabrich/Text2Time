Parachute Jump

For 26 years, the Parachute Jump at Coney Island lifted passengers 271 feet above the ground and then sent them plummeting excitedly to earth.

But the ride was closed down in 1967.

It stood silent and rusting, its base covered with graffiti. Last summer there was talk of tearing it down.

Many Coney Islanders were upset at the possible loss of the ride. ''It's the Statue of Liberty of Coney Island,'' said one resident, Marie Scordaras of West 16th Street.

But the local community board, fearing the ride could become a hazard, urged that it be torn down if it could not be repaired.
