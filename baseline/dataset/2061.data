Few companies have done more to make toll roads sexy than Macquarie Bank. Though not exactly a household name in the United States, the Australian bank has blazed a trail in infrastructure investments, wringing billions of dollars in profits from buying up bridges, airports and utilities in more than 100 countries, using a model that has inspired much bigger and better-known rivals.

But it’s precisely that financial system that has made one high-profile investor wary. At a conference last week, James Chanos, the short-selling hedge fund manager who helped expose Enron, claimed that Macquarie was on the brink of financial disaster.

Breakingviews has followed up with a long investigation into what exactly makes the financial giant down under tick — and whether its success can continue.

What Edward Chancellor and Lauren Silva uncovered was a complicated money machine that ultimately relies on a score of rosy assumptions, complicated accounting and a nearly inscrutable black-box model. Though it has done very well for its investors, the two suggest, Macquarie may be in for a hard fall with one misstep.

One thing is clear. Macquarie is a national icon that has done exceedingly well for its investors. Brimming with former politicians, the firm has proven that it can go toe-to-toe with the international heavyweights of finance. (For example, it outbid a string of rivals, including the state-owned Qatar Investments, to take control of Britain’s Thames Water utility last fall.) And while not necessarily a marquee name outside of Australia, its reach is extensive; drivers traveling on the Indiana Toll Road, for example, are riding on Macquarie’s turf.

Mr. Chancellor and Ms. Silva note just how profitable the firm has been for its investors. In its last fiscal year, the firm’s net operating profits rose 60 percent to A$1.4 billion. Its infrastructure funds have bestowed upon investors an average of almost 20 percent annually after fees.

Macquarie’s success has prompted infrastructure envy in much bigger rivals. It takes a great deal of profit to inspire Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and scores of private equity firms to follow your business model, after all.

At the heart of that system is a series of interlocking funds. Macquarie, which has a market value of A$23 billion ($19 billion), relies on related-party transactions to generate the bulk of its profits, finding 84 percent of its deal flow from those deals. After buying an asset with its own money — and relying on its own investment-banking team to handle the transaction — Macquarie then passes those holdings onto at least one of its funds.

Beyond charging those funds advisory, underwriting and management fees, the firm uses the system for other financial advantages. It reaps accounting advantages by paying its investors dividends that do not necessarily come from conventional earnings. In fact, Mr. Chancellor and Ms. Silva write, such payouts may actually stem from debt.

And leverage is the lifeblood of Macquarie’s business plan. Because its funds hold only minority stakes in the firm’s holding companies, they need not report the true amount of the debt their assets are carrying. The advantages of that are clear to even a casual observer; a report by a Merrill Lynch analyst last year dubbed Macquarie “The House That Debt Built,” finding that, unsurprisingly, the firm’s holdings are staggeringly leveraged.

That aggressiveness also shows up in Macquarie’s often-opaque books, which rely on fair-value accounting. Notorious for its use in Enron (and also its proposed use at the Blackstone Group), the approach allows changes in valuation to register as revenue. To book gains then, Mr. Chancellor and Ms. Silva write, Macquarie has only to lower the discount rate or raise expectations of future revenue for its holdings. And it does both often.

Some critics have challenged that approach, notably one of the firm’s former bankers. Now a research analyst, Steve Johnson wrote on his firm’s site that the Macquarie is:

“effectively projecting out their profits years in advance and bringing them back to today’s dollars… Impolite observers call this ‘front-ending’ their profits. It’s not illegal but it’s hardly conservative accounting practice.”

Which brings us to Mr. Chanos, the man who called on Enron’s black boxes and fair-value accounting before the rest of the market did. Speaking at the Ira W. Sohn Investment Research Conference in New York last week, the manager of Kynikos Associates charged that Macquarie “doesn’t care what it pays for assets and flips those assets to entities funded by other investors.” That approach is possible only in a credit bubble, Mr. Chanos said.

The short-seller told the Breakingviews writers that Macquarie’s fondness for black-box valuation models “allow revenues to be plucked out of thin air.” Ergo, Macquarie can justify the often eye-popping premiums it pays for assets. But fair-value accounting can easily lead a firm from aggressiveness to recklessness, he suggests.

Macquarie has dismissed such criticisms. At a business lunch earlier this week noted by DealBook, Chief Executive Allan Moss said that his firm could weather a 40 percent decline in the financial markets. “I don’t think there is much concern about the sustainability of the model by informed investors,” Mr. Moss said. “It’s mainly repeat business in our funds.”

Breakingviews’ Mr. Chancellor and Ms. Silva aren’t so sure:

Given the complexity of Macquarie’s holding company structure, investors are forced to rely on the valuations provided by the bank. These inevitably involve a degree of subjective judgment. There’s a danger that revenue growth forecasts could be too optimistic or risk premiums too low. However, since Macquarie doesn’t reveal all its valuation inputs, it’s hard for outside investors to judge for themselves. There’s a name in finance for situations such as this. It’s called “model risk.”

Mr. Chaos adds his own note of caution: “When accounting drives the economics of such deals, not vice versa, that usually leads to big trouble.”
