The letter from Mr. Gosselin’s lawyer was reported Thursday on “The Early Show” on CBS. The report said the letter was dated on Tuesday, the same day that TLC announced it would sideline Mr. Gosselin and rename the reality show “Kate Plus Eight.” The original “Jon & Kate” show drew a wide audience last spring when the couple’s marriage effectively collapsed, culminating in an on-camera separation announcement in June.

Mr. Gosselin’s lawyer, Mark J. Heller, told the CBS entertainment program “The Insider” that he had been in discussions to remove Mr. Gosselin’s eight children from the show weeks before TLC announced the changes to the show.

Mr. Heller released this statement Thursday afternoon:
