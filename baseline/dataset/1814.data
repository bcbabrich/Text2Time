When you’re phone-banking, dialing call after call after call to registered Democratic voters for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, “NH” means not home. “LM” is left a message. And “CB” is a callback.

These are the cryptic notations that Peter Ranis, who had just signed up to volunteer, was learning to mark on his call sheets Friday afternoon as he worked his way through lists of voters.

“I’ve given money to the campaign but now I want to give my time,” said Mr. Ranis, 70, a professor of political science at the City of University of New York who had just got off the elevator to the phone bank operation on the fifth floor of the United Federation of Teachers building at 52 Broadway in Manhattan.

There are 60 phones, and some 500 volunteers have cycled through the two call rooms there since last week, when they were first staffed. Upstairs, on the 10th floor, the teacher federation’s volunteers are working another 75 phones in yet another boiler room, calling only union members to get out the vote.

“It’s surprising, but a lot of people don’t know that there’s a primary Tuesday,” said Nahiyan Ahmad, 26, a co-manager of the phone bank, who was instructing Mr. Ranis on his duties. He had been parachuted in from Senator Clinton’s campaigns in Iowa and Nevada to organize a calling blitz before what some people in the room called “Super Duper Tuesday.”

There is another phone bank for Senator Clinton at 308 Lenox Avenue in Harlem, and four more in each of the other boroughs. Managers had no available tally of the call numbers, but the U.F.T. operators estimated that 65,000 union members had been called so far in the 10th-floor operation.

Sometimes, when the Clinton phones are fully occupied, volunteers are asked to call voters on their own cellphones. And college students are being encouraged to export the phone bank ethic by organizing “B.Y.O.P.” parties — as in Bring Your Own Phone — in their dorm rooms.

The protocol was for volunteers to talk amicably with call recipients, following a simple script, asking whether they were leaning toward Senator Clinton. If so, they were asked “Can Hillary count on your support?” Those who expressed especial enthusiasm were asked: “Can Hillary call on you to volunteer by making calls?”

After hours of phoning, “there can be wear and tear,” said Mr. Ahmad the co-captain, who worked as a health care consultant before his stint with the Clinton campaign. “I tell people they have to take a rest now and then.”

The room resonated with a low babble of “Hillary,” “Hillary,” “Hillary.”

“I think Hillary is a supremely intelligent woman, and will be smarter than any president we’ve ever had,” Mr. Ranis was saying.

Next to him, Annie Segan, 58, a volunteer from Manhattan who is studying for a Ph.D. in psychology, paused a moment between dialing opportunities. “I never felt more strongly about having someone in the White House,” she said, “and I never felt more strongly that I could make a difference.”

Nearby, Isabel Saurina, a 42-year-old writer from Barcelona who has a United States visa, was working the phone, calling Hispanic voters. “I can’t vote for Hillary but I can work for her,” she said between calls. “We are getting a lot of support from Latino voters, and they’re telling me that they want to bring their friends in, to volunteer.”

David Turley, 29, a Mexican-American volunteer, had joined the call bank because “the whole immigration issue drives me nuts,” he said. “The whole idea of rounding up illegal immigrants reminds me of Nazi Germany. Hillary has the right position, and the willingness to work with all the parties to this complex issue.”

Debra Nelson, 53, a lawyer from Douglaston, Queens, started volunteering Friday and made 35 calls in two hours. “One 88-year-old woman told me ‘Hillary has my vote,’ and one elderly man told me, ‘You have my vote and my wife’s vote and my two children’s votes.”

She paused before dialing again, then said: “I don’t want to jinx her, but in my heart, I believe that Hillary will be our first female president. And that’s why I’m here.”

Friday afternoon, many people weren’t home to answer their phones. Others were “undecided, and a few are for Obama, and a couple are cranky,” Mr. Turley said. “But Latinos are never rude to me.”

New Yorkers can have “a terrible reputation,” said Jason Watson, the 24-year-old co-captain of the phone bank, “but they haven’t been rude to me. O.K., though, once in a while people don’t want to listen to what we have to say.”

Mr. Watson, a Yale graduate from Tacoma, Wash., was working for Senator Clinton’s campaign in Nevada, he said, “and there were a lot of undecideds when we were calling there. But I’m not finding that many of them here.”

Ms. Segan said that few of those she had called had been nasty, but a couple had the power to flabbergast. “I was talking to one woman who told me that she wouldn’t vote for a woman.” Ms. Segan sighed. “Sometimes I don’t understand where people are coming from.”

As the primary approaches, the number of volunteers is likely to increase, said Mr. Watson. And on Monday and Tuesday, some of the phone bankers will find themselves blinking in natural light, ascending to the level of what is called “doing visibility.”

“I’ll be greeting voters physically,” Ms. Segan explained. “Getting out the message personally on the streets. That’s when it all comes together.”
