TAMPA, Fla. – The Yankees have one responsibility Tuesday: be in street clothes by 10 a.m. That is when training camp turns into summer camp. Following the success of last year’s surprise field trip to a pool hall, Manager Joe Girardi is instituting another mandatory day of fun, food and fellowship.

Girardi would not divulge the activity – another afternoon at the pool hall is a strong possibility – but he said it would definitely involve competition.

“I’ve got some work I’ve got to do to prepare for it, but it’ll be fun,” he said.

Players have fond memories of that excursion last year and say it helped unite them. The field trip also helped the image of Girardi, who was perceived as uptight during his first season as the Yankees’ manager.

Planning another outing was one of the first things Girardi talked about this spring. The only question was where the team would go. Citing injury risk, Girardi rejected paintball and bowling as suggestions.

Phil Hughes suggested a pool party. “Water slides,” he said.

Dave Robertson said that if he were in charge, he would take everyone fishing. Then he heard Hughes’s suggestion.

“That’s even better,” Robertson said. “A pool party barbecue.”

Robertson volunteered to grill. Hamburgers and chicken are his specialty, he said.

After Monday’s workout, two new possibilities were broached with Girardi.

How about Ping-Pong?

“You worry about guys overswinging,” Girardi said.

A Scrabble tournament?

“Now that would be interesting,” he said.
