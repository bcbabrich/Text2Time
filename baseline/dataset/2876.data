Both winners were a testament to how deep the United States moguls team is and how difficult selecting only seven athletes for the Olympic squad is going to be. Right now, Moseley, the defending Olympic gold medalist, is on the outside looking in after his ninth-place finish today.

''At this point, I'm in trouble,'' said Moseley, who has one top-10 World Cup finish this season and is well behind the front-runner, Jeremy Bloom. ''I've got four World Cups to go.''

Moseley hopes that the more the judges see the dinner roll -- a move that would be illegal if his feet went over his head for an inverted aerial -- the better his chances of scoring well. If they do not come to accept the jump, Moseley will have to decide whether he will go back to the blah-blah basics to give himself a shot at making the Olympic team.

''I'll either have to change or go to the X Games,'' he said.

He has made a good living off his flamboyant style and Hollywood smile, parlaying his Olympic gold in 1998 in Nagano, Japan, into film work. But his comeback has been frustrating, and the talent on the men's team has proved deeper than most expected.

Bloom has come out of nowhere to stand on two World Cup podiums. His decision to defer his football scholarship at the University of Colorado to try out for the Olympic team has paid off. The 19-year-old Bloom used veteran caution and held back today, finishing fifth as he nursed a groin injury.
