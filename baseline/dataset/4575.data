Lawyers in the State Attorney General's office are used to people who sue the state over everything and nothing: disgruntled prison inmates, self-taught legal experts and conspiracy theorists who feel persecuted by random public officials from State Comptroller Edward V. Regan to President Bush.

In the last few years, some of the lawyers have come to know one frequent litigator quite well. But they say that there are two differences between Robert L. Schulz and your average lawsuit-happy zealot. Mr. Schulz doesn't seem to be a nut. And he occasionally wins his cases.

It was a Schulz lawsuit that two years ago forced the state to stop using taxpayers' money to exhort the same taxpayers to vote for the proposed 21st Century Environmental Quality Bond Act (the act was voted down). It was a Schulz lawsuit that prevented local officials in his Adirondacks hometown from installing a network of sewer pipes between Lake George and the Hudson River. Scheme to Sell a Prison

And if Mr. Schulz has his way, it will be his lawsuit that makes illegal the state's recent scheme to sell the Attica prison to a quasi-public state agency, a nimble accounting move that allowed the state to borrow money to help balance the 1990-91 budget but left the taxpayers with a $290 million interest bill, due over 30 years.
