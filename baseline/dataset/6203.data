Joe Beauchamp majored in English at Iowa State once upon a time so it would not he farfetched to call him the poet laureate of the San Diver) Chargers.

“Someone once said,” the Charger cornerback remarked the other day, “that it's better to have loved and lost than not to have loved at all. Well, it's better to have won at least one game than not to have won at all.”

Whether the Chargers have loved they're not saying, but they haven't won at all this season, which means they'll be trying to do that for the first time when they play the Giants at Shea Stadium at 1 P.M. today.

If Giant fans think their team has had trouble this season, consider the plight of Tommy Prothro's frustrated forces. In six games, they have scored a total of four touchdowns and have averaged 6 points a game. They have gained the fewest yards, 181 per game, in the league, and two weeks ago they lost Don Woods, their most potent offensive weapon, for the season with a knee injury.
