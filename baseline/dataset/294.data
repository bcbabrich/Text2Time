From its premise and pedigree, the Freeform series “Beyond” seems as if it should have more surprises than it does. The show is built to be mind-bending but doesn’t have the requisite urgency to entice you aboard for the ride. Instead, you have to force yourself to stay with it until about the four-hour mark, when it finally gets a bit of traction.

Holden, the central character, is a boy when Monday’s two-hour premiere begins, but only long enough to be injured in an accident. He spends the next 12 years in a coma and is a young adult when, to the shock of everyone, he suddenly wakes up. It’s not only his awakening that baffles medical science; he is also in fine physical shape despite a dozen years of immobility.

Holden’s mental condition, though, is another matter — he is jolted periodically by visions of some sort of hellscape. In the real world, meanwhile, he soon realizes that he is being pursued by ruthless people whose motives are not immediately clear.

Burkely Duffield, who plays the grown-up Holden, is too flavorless to grab your attention and sympathy with the thin material he is given in the early episodes. We learn almost nothing about Holden before the coma, so when we meet him again 12 years later he’s basically a stranger. It’s hard to root for or care about someone we barely know.
