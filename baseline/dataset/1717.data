I had no inkling of the brilliant new postage stamps honoring America’s first family of animation – the Simpsons – issued by the United States Postal Service in early May. At least not until Saturday, when the accumulation of stampless unmailed bills chez moi forced an emergency trip to the post office.

There they were. Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie — each in a classic head shot against a little rectangular patch of electric color beaming forth with psychic and visual power. There was no sound, motion, space or plot to help them out, only color, line scale and lots of personality. I may speak more as a “Simpsons” fan than an art critic, but really, are these not among the best American stamps ever? Disregard our age’s plethora of Simpsoniana – the juice cups, the lunch boxes, the toothbrushes. Contemplate the chance of progress within the limited format of the postage stamp. There’s not much, but Simpsons stamps make some. They pop.

First, the peerless expressions, defined by Matt Groening’s inimitable thickish line. Homer is caught with mouth agape and tongue rippling — the panicked squawk, not the famous “D’oh.” Marge purses her lips and looks confused, as if vaguely sensing one of Homer’s clumsy scams. Bart wears his sweaty busted-again grin. Lisa is all sweet, I-tried-to-tell-you beneficence. Maggie’s glare suggests that someone is stepping on her nightgown. Her pacifier has two bounce commas, the only sign of motion in the entire series.

Second, chromatic wattage. The Simpson palette has always seemed as radical and subversive as the show’s social commentary and close in artifice to that of innovative colorists like Andy Warhol, Bruce Nauman and Matthew Barney. Five amped-up hues suffice: egg-yolk yellow, magenta, Marge-Simpson’s-hair blue, darkened chartreuse and lavender, plus important bits of white (mainly eyes and teeth) and touches of red. Subtle distinctions of tonality are made. Homer’s yellow head is seen against a slightly darker yellow background. Marge’s hair is slightly darker than the blue behind Bart. Red defines only Homer’s tongue, Maggie’s pacifier, Marge’s beads and the smidgeon of Bart’s T-shirt.

Third, less is more. The “Simpsons” gestalt is boiled down to its essence and so is stampness. The images are stripped of detail except for the letters USA and the number 44 (cents, the new first class). No fussy engraved textures, no identifying names. This allows color to take over and the faces to pop out. Like a Richard Serra sculpture, only smaller and a whole lot cheaper, the stamps prove the adage that scale has nothing to do with size. They strike David-like blows against the Goliaths of American visual illiteracy.

It’s not news that the Simpsons work almost as well off screen as on. But these images still amaze. Slowed to a standstill, deeply cropped and confined, their portraits single out for tribute both the family’s indelible inmates and the breathtaking economy that brings them to life. I don’t know whether to affix them to my delinquent bills or have them framed.
