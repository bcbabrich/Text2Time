President Obama outlined his reasons for increasing troops in Afghanistan, but promised the war would not go on without end. The advance text can be read here.

So did Mr. Obama accomplish his goal of explaining to Americans why the war is necessary – in fact, vital – to the national security of the United States? And why the cost – in blood and treasure – is worth it for a conflict that is lurching into its ninth year?

The words from the president, which at times were soaring, seemed to do very little to settle the discontent from the left. Several Democratic lawmakers put out statements decrying the troop increase, while the liberal group MoveOn urged its members to call the White House and complain, saying: “The president needs to hear.”

Others, including Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said he would take time to think through the president’s proposal before passing judgment.

As for the most important audience – rank-and-file Americans – it will take a few more days to get a reliable read from opinion polls of how people viewed the speech. The president did not explicitly call for sacrifices from Americans, but rather urged them to hold on a little longer for a fight that is just and necessary.

The speech was notable for Mr. Obama because unlike most of his other major addresses, it did not include any personal anecdotes. There were no specific stories of soldiers he has met or families he has consoled. Instead, Mr. Obama braced Americans for the difficulty ahead and sought to put the fight in the context of history.

“We are not as young – and perhaps not as innocent – as we were when Roosevelt was president,” Mr. Obama said as he neared his conclusion. “Yet we are still heirs to a noble struggle for freedom. Now we must summon all of our might and moral suasion to meet the challenges of a new age.”

They are the challenges of the age of Obama.

From Jim Rutenberg: During the lead-up to tonight’s address, many Republicans promised to support the president if he fulfilled General Stanley A. McChrystal’s request for more troops in Afghanistan.

In a statement, the Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele made good – though he also telegraphed what is certain to come with that general support in the coming days: Criticism of Mr. Obama’s inclusion of a time frame in which to begin drawing troops down (July, 2011).

Mr. Steele’s statement:

“Although this decision took far too long and it should not have, I am glad the president will finally provide General McChrystal with the troops he needs. However, tonight’s speech must be the beginning, not the end, of the case President Obama makes to the American people as to why this is, as he said during the campaign, ‘a war we have to win.’ If the president remains committed to this crucial fight, Republicans – and the American people – will stand with him. But sending mixed signals by outlining the exit before these troops even get on the ground undermines their ability to succeed.”

Meanwhile, Karl Rove, appearing on Fox News Channel with Bill O’Reilly tonight, also complimented the president on the basic points of his announcement. “The core of tonight was good news,’’ Mr. Rove said, though he added, “But it was badly delivered, in a weak frame.”

Mr. Obama concluded his speech with a call for unity, harking back to the days immediately following the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.

“It is easy to forget that when this war began, we were united – bound together by the fresh memory of a horrific attack, and by the determination to defend our homeland and the values we hold dear,” Mr. Obama said. “I refuse to accept the notion that we cannot summon that unity again.”

It was, in a sense, an effort to pre-empt the criticism that is surely coming from the left and the right. The words carried a ring of poetry to them – sounding a bit like George W. Bush himself back in that time – but it remains an open question how realistic they are.

“America, we are passing through a time of great trial,” Mr. Obama said. “And the message that we send in the midst of these storms must be clear: that our cause is just, our resolve unwavering.”

Mr. Obama completed his 33-minute speech and plunged into the audience to shake hands with cadets. As strains of military anthems filled the auditorium, the president smiled and posed for photographs with the cadets seated near the front row.

The scene on television, once again, underscored why it was delivered at West Point and not in a room at the White House.

The president addressed Pakistan directly, saying: “In the past, we too often defined our relationship with Pakistan narrowly. Those days are over.”

Even though Mr. Obama set a goal – if conditions are met – of beginning to withdraw troops in July 2011, he said that the commitment to Pakistan would not wane. He said the United States would continue to provide “substantial resources” to support the democracy and development of Pakistan.

“The Pakistani people must know,” Mr. Obama said. “America will remain a strong supporter of Pakistan’s security and prosperity long after the guns have fallen silent, so that the great potential of its people can be unleashed.”

The constraints of a prime-time speech, perhaps, did not give the president enough time to explain this conundrum: How do you reassure Pakistan that the United States will stay engaged, even as you set at least a goal for withdrawal? He seemed to try to answer the question – at least in passing – as he defended his decision.

“The absence of a time frame for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government,” Mr. Obama said.

Mr. Obama flatly rejects the analogy to the Vietnam War.

For months, the president and many of his advisers have studied Vietnam and read books on the subject, seeking to draw lessons and parallels to the Afghanistan war.

“This argument depends upon a false reading of history,” Mr. Obama said. “Unlike Vietnam, we are joined by a broad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action. Unlike Vietnam, we are not facing a broad-based popular insurgency. And most importantly, unlike Vietnam, the American people were viciously attacked from Afghanistan, and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border.”

It was among the most explicit Mr. Obama has been on this subject, perhaps an attempt to head off the criticism from liberal Democrats who have been quick to compare the two conflicts and call Afghanistan a quagmire.

Jim Rutenberg, who covered former President George W. Bush, notes:

Often lost in the back and forth over President Obama’s deliberations on whether to increase the number of troops in Afghanistan is how very similar they were to those of President George W. Bush when he was considering a similar troops increase in Iraq three years ago.

Like Mr. Obama, Mr. Bush delayed making an announcement so he could further study the likely effects of what became known as “the surge”.

Just as Mr. Obama and his aides have grappled with concerns over whether the Afghan president Hamid Karzai can hold up his end of the bargain, Mr. Bush wrestled with concerns over whether Prime Minister Nuri Kamal Al Maliki would be able to hold up his.

Both Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush made their decisions in the face of poll numbers showing a public eagerness to see the troops come home. And in each president’s case, the general contours of the plans were well known by the time of their prime time addresses outlining their strategies.

Of course, there are differences. Mr. Bush, clearly, did not have one Dick Cheney publicly criticizing his deliberative process – just as Mr. Obama does not have vocal critics of his troops increase in the Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid and the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who together warned Mr. Bush away from his troops increase in a letter they released a few days before his January 10, 2007, announcement.

With criticism that he often came off as too bellicose, Mr. Bush gave his speech that night in the White House library; his aides hoped the room would create an intimate setting for what was billed as a frank conversation about a difficult and unpopular war.

Often criticized as too soft and arguably still establishing his national security credentials, Mr. Obama is addressing a large gathering of military at West Point.

Whatever the differences, Mr. Obama and his aides clearly hope their surge makes as much progress as did the one Mr. Bush announced nearly three years ago.

Mark Landler, our diplomatic correspondent, reports:

While most of the attention will be on troop numbers, President Obama’s Afghanistan strategy also includes a hefty deployment of civilians to help Afghans with everything from better governance to finding alternatives to poppy cultivation.

The numbers sound small: the American civilian force on the ground has tripled from 300 to 900 people. But the State Department points out that for every foreigner, there are 10 or 15 Afghans working alongside them – meaning there is a civilian development force of roughly 10,000.

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will also take a prominent role in trying to keep President Hamid Karzai on the straight and narrow. Drawing on her unlikely rapport with him, she will be the administration’s key interlocutor with the Afghan leader.

“For better or worse, Hillary Clinton has become Karzai’s date for the next three years,” said Bruce Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who advised Mr. Obama on his initial Afghan strategy.

Mr. Obama is speaking with a forceful sense of authority – perhaps more so than he has displayed at any other moment of his young presidency. The decision to deliver the speech at the military academy at West Point, rather than the Oval Office, became clear during the first cutaway shots on television.

The faces of the cadets, dressed in their blue and gray, are somber and intent. They are doing at least some of the president’s job for him tonight: Showing that the stakes of the war are high.

“I see firsthand the terrible wages of war,” Mr. Obama said. “If I did not think that the security of the United States and the safety of the American people were at stake in Afghanistan, I would gladly order every single one of our troops home tomorrow.”

The speech is a culmination of a series of recent military moments for a president who never served in uniform. Without war stories of his own, he sought to explain that he understands “the heaviest of all burdens.” And in quick succession, he told of his trip to meet flag-draped caskets at Dover Air Force Base; his visits to Walter Reed; the letters that he receives from parents and spouses of those who are deployed.

It is this moment that provides a level of emotion to an otherwise serious, but studious speech from Mr. Obama that at times sounds like part geography lesson, part political lesson and part history lesson.

President Obama began with an explanation. And in seven simple words, he laid out why he had decided to escalate the war in Afghanistan, declaring: “We did not ask for this fight.”

With those words, Mr. Obama formally assumed ownership of the war that began eight years ago. With those words, the commander-in-chief began his attempt to explain to a war-weary nation why it is necessary, once again, to send more troops to Afghanistan.

“Afghanistan is not lost,” Mr. Obama said, “but for several years it has moved backwards.”

The president is standing against a backdrop of flags, speaking to a large audience of cadets. Before he outlined the strategy, he explained why his review of Afghanistan took more than 90 days, saying: “I owe you a mission that is clearly defined and worthy of your service.”

“I do not make this decision lightly,” he added.

Here’s the advance text of the president’s speech.

Sheryl Gay Stolberg, at West Point, reports: Arter the invocation and playing of The Star Spangled Banner, Col. Ty Siedule, a professor of history, gives cadets a history lesson as they wait for Mr. Obama to arrive.

“Presidents come here to acknowledge the sacrifices West Pointers make,” he said, adding that in the Civil War, one-third of the academy’s graduates were killed or wounded. He notes that West Point alumni include “some of the most celebrated names in the nation’s history: Grant and Sherman, Pershing and Eisenhower, Westmoreland and Abrams, Schwartzkopf and Shinseki.

He quotes former President Bill Clinton, who once said, “It is said here at West Point that much of the history you teach is made by the people you taught.”



Elisabeth Bumiller, a Pentagon correspondent, reports:

President Obama will be speaking from the place that incubated the high command of America’s two ongoing wars.

Not only did Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top American and NATO commander, graduate from West Point in 1976, so did General Ray Odierno, the top American commander in Iraq. Gen. David H. Petraeus, the head of Central Command who oversees both wars, graduated at the top of the West Point class of 1974.

And a former general, Karl W. Eikenberry, who now serves as the American ambassador to Kabul, graduated in the West Point class of 1973.

Air Force One landed at Stewart Air Force Base and took a 10-minute helicopter ride to West Point.

The president took most of his war council with him, including: Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton; Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates; Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki; Gen. James L. Jones, the national security adviser; Gen. David Petraeus, chief of U.S. Central Command; Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Lt. Gen. Douglas E. Lute, a special assistant to the president and coordinator for Afghanistan and Pakistan; and John Tien, senior national security director for Afghanistan and Pakistan.

A handful of Democratic and Republican members of Congress, including some West Point graduates, also are in attendance. The speech will be delivered before an audience of about 4,250 people, including senior, junior and sophomore cadets.

Sheryl Gay Stolberg, who is on site at West Point, reports:

Many speeches have been delivered at the military academy, but never before have cadets heard orders directly from a commander-in-chief who could send them into a war zone.

There is a sense of anticipation in the air. A West Point official brought a handful of carefully selected cadets – seniors with impressive resumes – to speak to reporters.

Alexandra Rosenberg, 22, of Manhattan, is a Rhodes and Truman Scholar with plans of becoming a doctor. Eric Bernau, 21, of Rochester Minn., is the cadet public affairs officer, who spent a semester studying in China. And Tyler Gordy, 26, came to West Point after serving as an infantryman and getting wounded in Iraq. He is First Captain, supervising 4,000 cadets.

The three will be among those seated behind the secretary of state and secretary of defense for Mr. Obama’s speech, which Mr. Bernau described as “the most momentous day in our four years of the academy.”

“I mean, he’s the commander in chief, he’s our boss,” Mr. Bernau said. “It’s kind of like a shareholders meeting where you hear the strategy of the company.”

These cadets will graduate as second lieutenants and platoon leaders.

While Ms. Rosenberg will go to Oxford in the fall, the other two fully expect to be deployed, and have chosen the infantry as where they want to serve.

“This doesn’t make me nervous, it doesn’t scare me or anything,” Mr. Gordy said. “I have known this for five years now. What it does is give me a sense of direction.”

President Obama’s address to the nation from the United States Military Academy at West Point will begin at 8 p.m. He left the White House after a daylong series of calls to foreign leaders, followed by a late-afternoon briefing to Congressional leaders.

By now, broad outlines of the speech are known: 30,000 more American troops will be sent to Afghanistan; the goal for beginning to withdraw the first wave of forces will be July 2011; the strategy is aimed at preventing Al Qaeda from returning to Afghanistan, where the Sept. 11 attacks were planned.

It is the president’s burden, of course, to explain why he believes the war in Afghanistan should be escalated.

We are monitoring the speech from West Point, N.Y., where our colleague Sheryl Gay Stolberg, is on hand. She reports that cadets, in blue-gray uniforms, are taking their seats inside the auditorium at Eisenhower Hall on the academy’s leafy, river-side campus.

The rest of our team is in the Times’ Washington Bureau, where our national security and political correspondents are watching – and reporting – the president’s speech.

I’m a White House correspondent for the Times, and I’ll be anchoring the coverage for our Caucus blog, with contributions from my colleagues.

The White House has just released a few excerpts of the speech. Here they are:

The 30,000 additional troops that I am announcing tonight will deploy in the first part of 2010 – the fastest pace possible – so that they can target the insurgency and secure key population centers. They will increase our ability to train competent Afghan Security Forces, and to partner with them so that more Afghans can get into the fight. And they will help create the conditions for the United States to transfer responsibility to the Afghans.” “Because this is an international effort, I have asked that our commitment be joined by contributions from our allies. Some have already provided additional troops, and we are confident that there will be further contributions in the days and weeks ahead. Our friends have fought and bled and died alongside us in Afghanistan. Now, we must come together to end this war successfully. For what’s at stake is not simply a test of NATO’s credibility – what’s at stake is the security of our Allies, and the common security of the world.” “Taken together, these additional American and international troops will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces, and allow us to begin the transfer of our forces out of Afghanistan in July of 2011. Just as we have done in Iraq, we will execute this transition responsibly, taking into account conditions on the ground. We will continue to advise and assist Afghanistan’s Security Forces to ensure that they can succeed over the long haul. But it will be clear to the Afghan government – and, more importantly, to the Afghan people – that they will ultimately be responsible for their own country.”
