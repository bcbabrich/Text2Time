June 17, 1994: Robert Kardashian Reads Simpson’s Letter

At a news conference, Robert Kardashian, a friend of Mr. Simpson’s, read a letter that he said Mr. Simpson had written just before he was to turn himself in.

First, everyone understand I have nothing to do with Nicole’s murder. I loved her. I always have and I always will. If we had a problem, it’s because I loved her so much. …



I think of my life and feel I’ve done most of the right things so why do I end up like this? I can’t go on. No matter what the outcome people will look and point. I can’t take that. I can’t subject my children to that. This way they can move on and go on with their lives. Please, if I’ve done anything worthwhile in my life, let my kids live in peace from you, the press.

I’ve had a good life. I’m proud of how I lived. My mama taught me to do unto others. I treated people the way I wanted to be treated. I’ve always tried to be up and helpful. So why is this happening? I’m sorry for the Goldman family. I know how much it hurts.
