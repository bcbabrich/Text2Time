On another level, ''Rhapsody in August'' is also the director's first film in years that is essentially a family drama unfolding in an intimate setting, a far cry from the fantastic milieus of ''Akira Kurosawa's Dreams'' or the outsize historical epics of ''Ran,'' ''Kagemusha'' and other recent movies. In the film community, Mr. Kurosawa's autocratic style and mania for perfection have earned him the sobriquet the Emperor. Indeed, on the set crew members run, not walk, at his directions, and one can see that his sense of control is total.

''I was surprised to see he was even more of an emperor than I really thought he'd be,'' said Mr. Gere. ''He's had his team together so long, and he is the Great Man of Japanese cinema. If he calls out an actor's name, the actor steps forward with a 'Hai! Domo arigato!' '' (''Yes! Thank you!'') Another famous characteristic of Mr. Kurosawa's film-making is his shooting every scene with two or three cameras, none of them close up. Mr. Gere said the director explained to him that if the actors don't know which angle is being shot, they act more naturally.

''My argument to him was that you're not taking advantage of a trained actor, who can focus his energy at the camera lens if he knows where the light and camera are coming from,'' Mr. Gere recalled. ''I was very open with him about that, and I think people on the set were a little shocked.''

One More Chance

Over the years, Mr. Kurosawa has clashed with producers and critics on a Shakespearean scale, and what some say is his compulsiveness led to his suicide attempt in 1971 after a series of painful setbacks.

But in a remarkable change of heart, Mr. Kurosawa's backers for ''Rhapsody in August'' are a consortium of 18 Japanese companies put together by the Shochiku Company, a leading movie company that walked away from Mr. Kurosawa after backing ''The Idiot,'' a critical and financial failure made in 1951.

Industry people say that decades after shunning Mr. Kurosawa, Japanese businesses have come to recognize the public relations value of supporting the recipient of every honor the film industry has to offer, including a special Academy Award last year for lifetime achievement.
