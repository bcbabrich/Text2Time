Aaron Glenn makes sure the ball is hidden from the veterans.

Even Saturday, an off day at the Jets' summer camp, Glenn told his fellow rookie Ryan Yarborough to hide it.

"It's in his car," disclosed Glenn. "In a safe place."

The ball is symbolic, true. But it is also very important to Coach Pete Carroll, who has entrusted Glenn, his top draft pick, with watching over it.

Carroll is the rookie head coach, and he has adopted this philosophy as he oversees offense, defense and special teams: the ball.

"We want to control it," he said. "We want to keep it on offense, and turn it over on defense."

His role as head coach, for now, is to be around the ball on the practice field. He is not coaching players on where they stand or how they move. But every player understands what Carroll is doing.
