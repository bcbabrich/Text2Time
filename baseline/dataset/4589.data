Does Kingsolver believe that the "forty-something New Yorker traveling alone" should have relinquished the seat if she didn't want to? I hope not. I've seen several situations -- also on airplanes -- in which parents acted as if they deserved special consideration because they were traveling with a child. One woman assumed she would receive her meal first; another assumed that the passenger sitting next to her wouldn't mind if her child lay down across both of their laps. Do I think the other airline passengers should accept a "collective responsibility" for those children? Hardly. Does this mean that I don't love children. Of course not. NANCY MUELLER Seattle
