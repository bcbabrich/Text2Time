Congressional investigators issued a legal opinion today saying that Oliver L. North's conviction for destroying Government documents in the Iran-contra affair casts ''serious doubt'' on whether he is entitled to his military pension.

The opinion, which came after the Navy had already suspended Mr. North's $23,000-a-year pension, said the former Marine Corps lieutenant colonel could sue the Government to win the pension back. A telephone call to Mr. North's lawyers today was not returned.

Lawyers for the Navy said earlier that they wanted to restore Mr. North's pension, but the opinion by the General Accounting Office, a Congressional investigative body, appeared to eliminate the prospect that the Government would voluntarily reinstate the pension. The Navy asked for the opinion; the G.A.O. is authorized to advise Federal agencies on expenditures, including pay.

The opinion was addressed to Lawrence L. Lamade, General Counsel of the Department of the Navy. A Navy spokesman said the service would abide by the opinion, but added that Mr. North would still be eligible for other benefits provided to retired officers, including free medical care and commissary privileges at military bases.
