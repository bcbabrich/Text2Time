An armed Greek police officer was shot dead as he stood guard at the home of Britain's top military envoy here, Col. Mark Blatherwick, who was at home. The motive for the pre-dawn attack in the northern suburb of Kifissia was unclear. Four years ago, Greek terrorists gunned down Colonel Blatherwick's predecessor, Brig. Stephen Saunders, as he was driving to work from Kifissia. Anthee Carassava (NYT)
