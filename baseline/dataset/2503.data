Read aloud each of the statements below, and direct students to move to the corners of the room that best express their views on the statement. As students take their places, write the statement on the board. Then, ask at least one student in each group to share his or her opinion.

-Children should be seen and not heard.

-Bad behavior by children is the fault of the parents.

-Teachers should be allowed to discipline children.

-Kids today don’t have enough time to just be kids.

-Children should be given responsibilities at home like doing chores and being tidy.

3. Explain to the class that they will write letters responding to the article “Kids Gone Wild.” To begin, divide the class into groups of 3 or 4 students. Give student 5-10 minutes to read and discuss the article “Kids Gone Wild” //www.nytimes.com/learning/students/pop/articles/kidsgonewild.html, focusing on the questions below (provided as a handout for easier student access).

THE ARTICLE

-What examples of bad behavior does the article offer?

-What evidence does the author point to in order to support her argument?

-What specialists does she refer to and what are their opinions?

-Who and/or what do they say is to blame for these behaviors?

-What solutions do the author and specialists recommend?

-What specific points raised in the article do you feel merit a response?

-What, if any, facts do you have to support or refute one of these points?

-What, if any, personal experiences have you had that enable you to respond to this issue?

THE LETTERS

-Do the letters offer any new evidence or perspectives about the issue that were not raised in the article?

-To what degree do the letters present personal observations, references to facts or data, advice and/or reflections on the future?

-How are the sentences and paragraphs structured?

-How might age affect the authors’ opinions?

After a few minutes of review and discussion, students will work independently to write a letter that responds to an issue raised in the article. They should either agree or disagree with the stated position and follow the model of the letters to the editor when composing their response.

WRITING YOUR LETTER

-Be concise.

-Make your position clear.

-State your qualifications.

-Consider including personal experiences or observations with facts; advice or projections for the future.

-Be creative.

After 10-15 minutes, have students come together as a class and share their letters. Do any of them offer new ideas or ways of understanding the issue? Do the opinions tend to agree or disagree with the article? How might their personal experiences affect their opinions? Do their opinions rely on objective facts or personal experience?

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Students submit their letters to The Learning Network at //www.nytimes.com/learning/students/letters/index.html. Any published submissions should be clipped and retained in the students’ portfolios. Encourage students to post the original article and their letters on the school Web site and invite students and parents to respond via letter to the editor.

In addition, students write an essay reflecting on the subject of the article. They may consider the following questions (written in their journals prior to the end of class):

-To what degree does the article reflect your opinion about your own behavior and/or that of your peers?

-What advice might you follow if you were to raise a child today?

-What advice would you give parents about how to raise their children?

Have students submit their reflections for evaluation in the following class.

Further Questions for Discussion:

-What responsibility, if any, does a newspaper have to provide a space for readers to express their opinions?

-What is the difference between an editorial and a news article?

-To what degree is an editorial an opinion, fact or some combination of the two?

-Other than letters to the editor, what means does the general public have to express opinions about or respond to items published in the newspaper?

-Why might the public be interested in reading other readers’ opinions?

Extension Activities:

1. Write an editorial about a current issue affecting your peers, school or community and submit it to your school newspaper. Invite classmates to respond with their own letters to the editor. Keep track of the letters over the course of one week. How do they reflect the original intent of your editorial? To what degree do the opinions support or differ from your own? Do any of the letters present a new way of looking at the issue? Do any present new facts that support or refute your argument? Write a reflection that responds to these questions.

2. Read The Times every day for one week and identify one article for which you will write a response letter to the editor. Submit your letter according to the guidelines provided by The Times and notify the class if your letter is published. Keep a copy of your letter in your journal, along with subsequent letters to the editor responding to it. Write a short reflection expressing why you chose the article, as well as how and to what degree other readers’ opinions reflect your own. To order The New York Times for your classroom, click here.

3. Read The Times every day for two weeks and clip articles that pertain to kids’ lives. Bring the articles to class and as a group, lay them out as a Kids’ Edition of The New York Times. With your classmates, write a letter from the editor that provides an overview of this special edition, and prepare a series of editorials responding to articles in the paper. Invite students to submit letters to the editor (with guidelines a la The Times). Publish the Kids’ Edition as a semi-monthly or monthly paper.

4. What is the difference between an editorial, Op-ed and letter to the editor? Read examples of each to discover their characteristics in terms of tone and content. What are the similarities and difference? How do these pieces differ from news articles in terms of tone and content? Do there appear to be specific qualifications for writing each? Write a critical analysis of your findings.

5. Identify and research two theories of child development. What are the stages identified by the theorist? What does the theory indicate should be happening in a child’s life at each stage. How do the two theories support or refute one another? Prepare a poster of your findings.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Civics-To what degree do opinions expressed in local newspapers affect public policy? Read your local newspaper every day for one week and clip an article or column that responds to an issue of concern in your community. For the next week, clip letters to the editor that respond to the article. Do any of the letters call for an action to take place? Follow the newspaper to see if any subsequent action reflects the opinion and/or advice you expressed by readers. Write a reflection on the relationship between readers’ letters and public action.

Health-Identify and research 3 medications intended to control behavior in children. What are their intended purposes and how do they work? What are the side effects? Prepare an informational poster and present it to the class. In your presentation, present your opinion about the need and value of the medicines. What are the potential positive and negative affects of each?

Math- For one week, calculate the number of hours you spend on activities such as watching TV, playing video games, participating in sports or other recreational activities, sleeping, doing homework, being in school, talking on the phone and being on the Internet. Make a chart of your activities day by day for one week showing the absolute numbers and percentages. Create categories for the activities (such as active, passive, academic or domestic) and show the numbers and percentages for each category. Extend the numbers to a full year. What do the numbers suggest about your lifestyle in relation to the opinions expressed in the article? Write a short analysis of your findings.

Media Studies-How, if at all, do television and radio media handle comments and feedback from the public? How do they compare in terms of tone, format and/or content? Observe an example of each and prepare notes on your findings. Then convene a debate in class arguing for and against the regulation of TV and radio opinion programs.

Technology-Start a blog about issues of relevance for your class and/or community. How, if at all, will you regulate the way opinions are expressed on the site? How do opinions expressed on the blog compare with those in a published newspaper in terms of tone, format and content? Have a discussion in class about your observations.
