Members of Congress return this week newly educated about their constituents' growing doubts about the cost of the Iraq occupation, the health of the economy and the homeland's preparedness for disaster, whether by grid failure or terrorist plot. The troubling budget deficits so eagerly engineered by President Bush and his Republican majority have only worsened during the vacation. The G.O.P. leaders face a difficult agenda and there are already more signs of fresh procrastination than of resolve. A prime example is the leaders' unwillingness to break out the problem of the Northeast power grid's failure into an emergency measure free of the pork-laden energy bill.

If Congress learned anything this summer, it should be the need to become a driving force in demanding a far more candid and thoughtful Iraq reconstruction plan from the administration. The House was able to muster some independence when it came to demanding the import of lower-price prescription drugs and overruling parts of the Federal Communications Commission plan to allow big media companies to own more TV stations. We would like to see more of that kind of spirit, but it seems more likely that the majority will continue to move in lock step, as it did when members cruelly blocked working-poor families from the new Bush child-credit tax break other Americans enjoy. The president has so far failed to deliver on his vow to fight for the poor, but the opportunity is at hand if he dare resist his House majority leader, Tom DeLay.

The upcoming election cycle is likely to make it even more difficult to achieve progress on critical issues like homeland security. Members of Congress should be judged not so much by their patriotic rhetoric as their unwillingness thus far to adequately finance security at the nation's highly vulnerable ports or to begin inspecting cargo shipments aboard passenger jets. The Coast Guard estimates that $1 billion is needed next year to begin securing the ports; Congress so far has gone no higher than $150 million. And as Washington prepares to remember Sept. 11, Congress should press beyond White House resistance for the fullest inquiry into the terrorist plot's causes and money trail.

Given the amount of damage this Congress has done already, we might be grateful if the fall brought nothing more than large-scale standoffs already being predicted as lawmakers regather. The sorry House bill to protect gun makers from lawsuits would best die in the Senate. And the welfare reform issue will be difficult to address amid the continuing binge of deficit spending.
