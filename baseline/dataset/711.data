Administrivial Notepad-in-the-Tuesday-Puzzle Alert! If you solve the crossword using Across Lite, the iOS app or the Windows app, please take the time to read the Notepad in the Tuesday puzzle. I can’t tell you what it says because it would spoil the puzzle, but trust the emus: you’ll have a much better experience if you read it.

MONDAY PUZZLE — Well. Here we are, with a hilarious and well-developed puzzle by Loren Muse Smith and Andrea “I Rock Mondays” Michaels. Now I just have to blog this in a way that won’t get me fired. [What? — Ed.] [Nothing. — D.A.]

It’s definitely a refreshing theme by our standards, and this makes a pair of New York Times puzzles by Loren Muse Smith. There are three types of bras hinted at by the starts of the theme entries, and the revealer at 58 Across gives the entire puzzle an energetic boost. Interestingly, the last time BOOBY TRAPS was seen in The New York Times crossword was in 1968, and it’s high time it was brought back, so kudos, Ms. Smith, Ms. Michaels and Will Shortz.

What I really liked was the smoothness of the solve and you could definitely feel Ms. Michaels’s touch here. I don’t think I hit any speedbumps here at all. My favorite entries were PADDED CELL, PUSH UP DAISIES, MIRACLE WORKER, ODDS MAKER and SPORK.

Let’s chat with our constructors:

Constructors’ Notes:

Loren Muse Smith: A couple of years ago, Andrea emailed me, telling me I should consider trying to construct. We started working on various ideas – man, she’s a bundle of energy and enthusiasm! And patience. It occurred to me that I could take some wordplay I’d been joking around with for years before constructing and translate them into themes. I’ve been maintaining for years that BOOBY TRAPS would be a fun name for a bra store. So then I thought it’d be a cool revealer. My thought on its execution was utterly pedestrian; Andrea is the one who suggested going the disguise-the-bra-type-in-another-phrase idea. We racked our brains coming up with kinds of bras – training, halter, Wonder, support, plunge – until we settled on this group. It’s cheeky, but I hope solvers will be good sports as Will continues to allow the Grey Lady to, well, to bust out of her more traditional confines of propriety and decorum. Andrea Carla Michaels: I was impressed with Loren’s unbridled enthusiasm and hysterical anecdotes on “another” blog and thought she’d make a fantastic constructrix, if given a bit of a nudge. This took 3-/2 years to “develop”! It was quickly accepted 3 years ago, but sat on for who knows why! By the time it was ready to publish, we were told the fill would no longer fly. We had five entries, some starting with the bra type, some ending, so in order to get a cleaner fill, we decided four would be the new five, and we would start all the theme phrases with types of bras … Loren created a nice new grid with CHEST in the middle. But in the end, CLINT gave us the cleanest fill. We are thrilled that it’s finally seeing the light of day … and yes, we would like a medal AND a chest to pin it on!

O.K., then. Let’s change the subject:
