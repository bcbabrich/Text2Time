1 2 3 Martina Navratilova and Bob Bryan 6 6 10 Corina Morariu and Mike Bryan 7 4 4

Martina Navratilova is almost 50. She wears a bandage on one knee. Her eyesight isn’t as good as it used to be (or the challenge reply is indeed having issues). Opponents actually hit at her. But when it really counts, she can still pull it out. She and her partner, Bob Bryan, were facing Corina Morariu and Mike Bryan, Bob’s twin and the other half of their top-ranked doubles team. After splitting the first two real sets, they are locked in a champions tiebreak, which substitutes for a third set in mixed doubles here. Ahead by 2-0 in the tiebreak, Martina puts a makeable volley into the net. At 3-1, Bob seems in command of the point after returning Corina’s second serve. But Martina raises her hand to challenge the serve, saying she can see the mark out. As Safin could attest, a mark isn’t always a mark. The replay shows the ball has nicked both lines. They automatically lose the point.

Now Martina and Bob are ahead by 5-4. She is standing in the deuce court as a crosscourt exchange whisks by her left ear. She expects and produces a crisp, crosscourt backhand volley, too sharp for Corina and landing in the middle of the doubles alley before flying off the court. It was the kind of shot that would have toppled over the pyramid of tennis balls that teaching pros are so fond of placing at angles of the court. Martina and Bob are again in control, and he follows with an ace to put them ahead by 7-4. They never lose another point in the tiebreak and advanced to play another day. Sadly, this mixed doubles partnership is scheduled for a breakup. This is the last Open in Navratilova’s exemplary and storied career, one that will be remembered for her titles, the heart on her sleeve where her endorsement patches should have been, and that vintage backhand volley.
