But he also said that the mere presence of asbestos in a building did not mean its occupants were in danger. The degree of danger depends on whether the asbestos is crumbling and sending fibers into the air, and whether the material is in parts of the building where people are exposed.

He said that maintenance workers in boiler rooms or those who repair the buildings were at the highest risk.

The agency has not done a survey of asbestos contamination of private homes. It has found that at least 35,000 school buildings contain asbestos in potentially dangerous form.

Acting under a Congressional mandate, the E.P.A. last year issued rules requiring all schools to be inspected for asbestos dangers. Where such dangers are found, action must be taken to reduce or remove the danger by steps ranging from removal of the asbestos to sealing it off. Improving Technical Capability

Although the report did not recommend a similar program for putlic and commercial buildings, the agency did not rule out the possibility of a mandatory inspection and asbestos control program in the future. The recommendations to Congress in the report were limited to improving the nation's technical capability for dealing with asbestos by training more professionals, enforcing existing regulations for protecting schoolchildren and workers and trying to ''objectively assess'' how the program for cleaning up asbestos in schools is working.

John F. Welch, president of the Safe Buildings Alliance, an association of companies that formerly made asbestos building materials, criticized the report for what he said was ''an absence of concrete recommendations and guidelines for building owners.''

Mr. Welch also said he was unhappy that the agency did not give more publicity to a another E.P.A. survey of asbestos in 43 buildings owned by the Federal Government which showed that, on average, they contained no more asbestos fibers in the air than in the outside air of their area.
