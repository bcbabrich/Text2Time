Olympia & York Developments Ltd., the debt-laden Canadian developer, failed yesterday in its attempt to get a syndicate of banks to agree to extend by one year a $450 million loan that is to come due today.

Olympia & York also indicated yesterday that it had enough cash on hand to retire the portion of a $300 million commercial-paper program that matures today. The $300 million program was used to finance the Exchange Tower in Toronto.

The company had been trying to get the bank lenders of the $450 million loan to agree not to seize the loan's collateral, Scotia Plaza, a 68-story tower in Toronto's financial district.

It was not clear what the immediate implications of the banks' refusal to sign a standstill agreement would be.
