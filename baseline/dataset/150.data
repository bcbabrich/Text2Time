On today’s episode:

• Matt Apuzzo, a national security reporter for The New York Times. He has been writing about the Russia investigation since the beginning.

Background reading:

• George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign, was the improbable match that set off a blaze that has consumed the first year of the Trump administration.

• A Times investigation reveals missed signals, slow responses and a continuing underestimation of the seriousness of a Russian campaign to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.
