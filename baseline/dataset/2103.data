East

Remember when part of the wonder about the New England Patriots was how they were able to win three Super Bowls with only a few stars sprinkled among the collection of largely overlooked and unknown role players?

Forget that. This season, Coach Bill Belichick has his most talented team, a frightening concept for the opposition. Consider that last season the Patriots were minutes from going to another Super Bowl without a top-flight receiver and that they have won four division titles in a row, which is the N.F.L.’s longest streak. Rest assured, the Patriots will win, although the early part of their season got a lot tougher when safety Rodney Harrison was suspended for four games for violating the N.F.L.’s policy on performance-enhancing drugs. Harrison’s absence will probably thrust the first-round pick Brandon Meriweather into increased action against the Chargers (Week 2) and the Bengals (Week 4). But on offense, the Patriots may add a note of entertainment to their usual mind-numbing efficiency. With one of the league’s best receiving corps, including Randy Moss and Donte’ Stallworth, Tom Brady can finally go deep, and he will still be able to look for Wes Welker, the mighty mite who in the slot.

Not that the Patriots need more help, but their schedule, after a killer opening, eases up until the annual grudge match Nov. 4 at the Colts. The final six games are tough, including meetings with the Eagles, the Ravens, the Steelers and the Jets. Belichick is a master at managing — and ignoring — expectations, and he will need to do that this season. The expectations are simple: Super Bowl or failure.

The Jets were among the biggest surprises last season, finishing 10-6 in Eric Mangini’s first season. They lost by 21 points to the Patriots in the playoffs, but the Jets are still the only team with a chance to snatch the division from New England. To do it, they will have to be as injury-free as they were last season. Running back Thomas Jones’s strained calf muscle in training camp is worrisome, and the schedule — the opener against the Patriots, then a road game against the Ravens, and a three-game stretch in October against the Giants, the Eagles and the Bengals — is tougher. But the running game should be better, and that will help quarterback Chad Pennington, who was intercepted 16 times last season.

The Jets have to hope that the rookie cornerback Darrelle Revis, who held out for the first three weeks of training camp, can make an immediate impact to combat all those Patriots receivers. But getting to 10-6 may be tougher, and that could mean the Jets will be better but could still miss the playoffs.

The Buffalo Bills and the Miami Dolphins may be better than they were last season, but they still will not be good enough to topple the Patriots. The Bills, who have not been to the playoffs in seven seasons, could be one of the most intriguing teams in the A.F.C., largely because of their first-round pick, running back Marshawn Lynch. If he blossoms as a replacement for Willis McGahee, it will relieve the pressure on quarterback J. P. Losman. And that should set up the Bills to be competitive again.

At least the Bills are secure at quarterback; the Dolphins are not. Coach Cam Cameron will try to transplant his offense from San Diego, but unfortunately for the Dolphins, running back LaDainian Tomlinson and quarterback Philip Rivers stayed on the West Coast. Trent Green is in Miami, and it appears as if he will be scrambling for his life behind a poor offensive line. The Dolphins still have a strong but aging defense, and that will keep games close, but the offense probably will not be able to capitalize often.

West

This division is about one man: Norv Turner. With the San Diego Chargers, he has perhaps the N.F.L.’s most talented roster. But what he does with it — can he finally prove himself an able coach and not only a good offensive coordinator? — will shape the West and perhaps the entire A.F.C. There is little question that Turner will be good for Philip Rivers; mentoring quarterbacks is what he does best. What he has not done so well is win as a head coach (58-82-1).

Turner has never had LaDainian Tomlinson and Shawne Merriman to lean on before. But Marty Schottenheimer had this roster, and after dominating the regular season, the Chargers lost their first playoff game. The transition to Turner running the offense should be seamless because he was the Chargers’ coordinator in 2001, so look for another huge season from Tomlinson.

Ted Cottrell, the former defensive coordinator for the Jets, has the same job in San Diego, and he has far more talent to work with than he did in New York. The Chargers open with games against Chicago and at New England, and they play host to the Colts in November. The problem for them is simple: Matching last year’s 14-2 regular-season mark may be difficult, but anything less than a deep run in the playoffs will again be a crushing disappointment.

The Denver Broncos barely missed the playoffs last season when they lost in overtime to San Francisco in their regular-season finale. They will not miss out this season. The Broncos made one of the best off-season moves in the league by signing running back Travis Henry, who sprained his knee in the preseason but should still roll up yardage in the vaunted zone-blocking scheme. That will complement Jay Cutler’s emergence as a cool quarterback with the strong arm Coach Mike Shanahan loves. Denver spent most of the off-season reworking its defense, signing cornerback Dre’ Bly to play opposite Champ Bailey (good luck throwing against them) and hiring a new defensive coordinator, Jim Bates.

The Kansas City Chiefs squeezed into the playoffs at the Broncos’ expense last season, but their fates may be reversed this time. When Coach Herman Edwards went to Kansas City, he knew the team had to become younger, and it is happening. The offensive line, once the best in the business, has lost Willie Roaf and Will Shields to retirement in successive years, and Damon Huard has taken over for the 37-year-old Trent Green at quarterback. The defense has improved since Dick Vermeil’s days, but the offense is a shadow of itself. With another year or two of experience, and a more settled quarterback situation, the Chiefs should be ready to compete again, but right now this appears to be a rebuilding year.

The Oakland Raiders may not be good, but they are hardly ever boring. Lane Kiffin, the youngest coach in the N.F.L., wants to inject some of the Southern California Trojans’ vigor into an offense that was laughable by season’s end. But it is tough to do that with the first overall draft pick, quarterback JaMarcus Russell, engaged in a lengthy training camp holdout. Until Russell is ready to start — and it might have been awhile even if he had shown up on time — the Raiders will go with Josh McCown or Daunte Culpepper. Not an ideal way for a new regime to begin, so the Raiders will rely on defense — which was surprisingly good for a 2-14 team — especially in the early going. Fortunately for the Raiders, the early schedule gives them a break. They open against Detroit, then have games against the Browns and the Dolphins before the end of September. There is nowhere to go but up.



North

The weekly quarterback rankings will tell all you need to know about the division. Can Steve McNair continue to stave off Father Time and help the Ravens win another division championship? Can Ben Roethlisberger stay off the injury report long enough to give the Steelers’ new coach, Mike Tomlin, a taste of the division dominance Bill Cowher enjoyed in his 15 seasons? Can Carson Palmer engineer enough high-scoring games to offset the deficiencies in the Bengals’ defense? And when does Brady Quinn become Cleveland’s starter?

The Baltimore Ravens ran away with the North last season thanks to McNair injecting a dose of offensive competence into a team that used to rely almost solely on superb defense. Willis McGahee — a slashing runner — has arrived to replace the bulldozer that was Jamal Lewis, giving the Ravens more punch. Lewis’s departure for Cleveland was not much of a loss, but the move to New England by linebacker Adalius Thomas, the versatile linchpin of the top-ranked defense, was. Still, Baltimore is a talented, balanced, veteran-laden team that has a shrinking window to make a playoff run.

Coach Brian Billick saved his job when he took over the offensive play-calling and steered the Ravens to the playoffs, but losing to the Colts without scoring a touchdown has left a whiff of desperation. The Ravens have enough to win the division again, but age makes them vulnerable.

The Cincinnati Bengals had a chance to snare a wild-card spot last season with one victory in their last three games, but lost all three. After a season when the Bengals made headlines as much for legal problems as for good plays, the question is whether the distractions set back a franchise that had finally found its groove. The offense is in fine shape as long as Palmer is healthy. The defense, which finished 30th in the league, is what confounded the Bengals. The Bengals did not make many changes, so it will be up to the coaches to get more from that unit. If they do, the Bengals have a shot at the division title. More interesting may be whether they stay off the police blotter.

Only two years ago, the Pittsburgh Steelers won the Super Bowl, which makes them a team to watch, especially because they have a new coach. The Steelers still have much of the roster from the championship team, and they seem invigorated by the presence of Tomlin. The defense will remain the same under the coordinator Dick LeBeau, which is a good thing because it is still one of the best. That means the Steelers will go as far as Roethlisberger takes them. From motorcycle accident to concussion last year, Roethlisberger never got into a rhythm, and it showed in his 23 interceptions. If he can return to anything approaching his form in his first two seasons, when he was 27-4 as a starter, the Steelers have a shot to make Tomlin’s debut a successful one.

The Cleveland Browns will not go to the playoffs this season, but there is a buzz around this team for the first time since … well … since they got back to Cleveland. What matters most this season is how quickly Quinn becomes the starter. He had fans clamoring for him after an outstanding performance in the second preseason game. The Browns could start off badly, with games against Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Baltimore and New England in the first five weeks. That could open the door to Quinn. If he plays well, he will give the franchise hope for the future and could give Coach Romeo Crennel another season to prove things are finally turning around.

South

The Indianapolis Colts did not get to enjoy their Super Bowl victory for long before things started going haywire. It will not matter. The Colts have always been adept at replacing what appeared to be key cogs. Remember what a disaster losing Edgerrin James was supposed to be last season? He looked on from Arizona as the Colts won the Super Bowl.

The Colts proved last season that they could win in the regular season without the benefit of a solid defense. That is a good thing, because the defense appears to have taken a step back. Both starting cornerbacks are gone. Tackle Anthony McFarland is hurt, and linebacker Cato June is in Tampa with the Buccaneers. That is not ideal, but as long as Peyton Manning, Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne are standing, it is not a disaster. The Colts used their top two draft picks on offensive players, an acknowledgment that the team’s success goes through Manning.

The schedule gives the Colts a few breaks early, which should allow the new defensive players to round into form. After the season opener against New Orleans, the Colts do not face another team from last season’s playoffs until brutal back-to-back games with the Patriots on Nov. 4 and the Chargers the next week, although their division rival Jacksonville always gives them trouble. The Colts have five prime-time games this season, a questionable reward for winning the championship.

The South is an improving division, and the Jacksonville jaguars, who still have one of the N.F.L.’s best defenses, are a wild-card candidate. But their surprising decision to dump Byron Leftwich and go with David Garrard as the starting quarterback opens up questions about the offense, considering Coach Jack Del Rio was convinced Leftwich was his man little more than a month ago. Garrard was steady, if unspectacular last year (145 of 241 for 1,735 yards, 10 touchdowns and 9 interceptions), when Leftwich was hurt. But Garrard has apparently progressed enough to give Del Rio, whose job could be on the line, confidence that he could give the offense enough of a spark to take advantage of the Jaguars’ rock-solid defense.

The Tennessee Titans took a big step toward being a consistent playoff contender last season when quarterback Vince Young began electrifying the N.F.L. The Titans recovered from an 0-5 start to finish 8-8 . But Tennessee sustained key losses in free agency (Travis Henry and Drew Bennett), and cornerback Pacman Jones has been suspended for the season. The biggest questions are who will emerge as Young’s favorite targets and how will the ground game fare without a featured running back? Coach Jeff Fisher’s job could be on the line, and the schedule does the Titans no favors. They play nondivisional road games at New Orleans, Denver and Kansas City — all difficult places to win. And if they are in the race until the last week, the final game is a doozy: at Indianapolis.

If the Houston Texans finally become a winning team, maybe it will make people forget about how they passed on drafting Reggie Bush and Vince Young to select Mario Williams. But it does not help that Young is in the division and that Bush and the Saints visit in November. The Texans made one of the most significant acquisitions of the off-season, getting quarterback Matt Schaub from the Falcons. He has been a coveted starter-in-waiting, and his leadership should inspire a young team that seems to have a newfound confidence instilled by Coach Gary Kubiak. The Texans are not going to the playoffs yet, but a 9-7 record would count as a successful season for a team that has not won more than seven games.
