Ryan Reynolds, 42, is known for comedic leading-man roles like the Marvel superhero Deadpool, who wears a full bodysuit. Turns out, Mr. Reynolds wears a uniform in real life, too.

When he’s not on set, or being the face of the Armani Code Absolu fragrance, he can be found at home in Westchester County, N.Y., wearing a favorite T-shirt, well-worn trousers and trusty pair of boots. “My wife sort of jokes that I don’t need a closet, I need a drawer,” he said, referring to Blake Lively.

1. Shirt

I have an old T-shirt that I’ve had for maybe 18 years. It was black, but is gray now. And on the front it says Zukey Lake Tavern. I don’t even know where that is, but it’s a real tavern somewhere in the United States. I’ve had a couple of people say, “No way! That’s from my hometown.” I got it at a vintage store shortly after I moved to Los Angeles from Vancouver, way the hell long ago. Maybe this was in 1998 when everything in vintage stores was like four bucks.
