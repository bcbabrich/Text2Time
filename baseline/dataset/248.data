FX has described the setting of “Mayans M.C.” as “a post-Jax Teller world,” which says both very little about the series and perhaps all you need to know.

The name “Jax Teller” will mean nothing to you unless you watched “Sons of Anarchy,” the biker drama (one of FX’s biggest hits) loosely inspired by “Hamlet,” with Jax as the conflicted prince of a crime dynasty.

So “Mayans M.C.,” about another gang that figured in “Sons,” is a sequel, and one that feels very much aimed at people who already know who Jax Teller was.

But “post-Jax Teller world” might mean something else as well. It has been almost exactly a decade since Kurt Sutter brought “Sons” to air. It ran seven seasons, a full-throttle howl of family acrimony and complicated loyalties that bogged down in plotting and sloshed in gore as it went on.
