The composer Yotam Haber did some fascinating musical digging while at the American Academy in Rome recently. He discovered rare recordings of cantors from the 1950s, and then incorporated some of the sound into musical works. Sara Ivry passed on an audio interview she did with Mr. Haber for Nextbook.org, an online magazine of Jewish culture, along with some excerpts. Here is a link to the Nextbook.com page, which has the interview and excerpts. Ms. Ivry is a senior editor at the site.
