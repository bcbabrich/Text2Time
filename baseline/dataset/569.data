Re “Helping to Lift the Burden of Student Debt” (The Upshot, Jan. 25), about income-based repayment, which caps student loan payments and offers loan forgiveness after 25 years, or 10 years for those working in public service jobs:

As a law school graduate working as a public defender with over $155,000 in combined undergraduate/graduate student load debt, I can tell you that the revolution described in the article stopped short at addressing the real issues affecting student loan borrowers like me.

While it’s true that the changes in student loan repayment plans have lessened the risk of default for public loan borrowers exclusively, income-based repayment plans aren’t addressing the fundamental problems that having enormous student loan debt can have on individuals seeking to grow and attain what I call the “benchmarks of adulthood” — like the inability to save for retirement, or save for a down payment on a home, or the difficulties of getting a mortgage due to high student loan debt — and the challenges of expanding a family with few financial resources.

I’m on the income-based repayment plan and hope one day, eight years from now, to have my student loan debt forgiven in exchange for providing essential legal services to our community’s most vulnerable. I take pride in my work and hope to continue serving high-need populations, but I know that in doing so I am making it difficult, if not impossible, to reach these benchmarks of adulthood until I’m 40 because my crippling student loan debt simply doesn’t leave me with enough financial resources.
