A tiny South Bronx church's annual basketball tournament has become the unlikely catalyst for a court test of the Giuliani administration's position that condoms should not be handed out in city parks.

For two years, distribution of free condoms was part of tournament of the All Saints Lutheran Parish in the borough's Mott Haven section.

But late last month, when the church received its permit for the tournament from the City Parks and Recreation Department, there was a handwritten note at the bottom saying that condom distribution was forbidden in all city parks and recreation sites.

In response to the church's request for help, lawyers from the New York Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit late yesterday afternoon to try to force the city to allow the condoms to be given out. Justice Alice Schlesinger of state Supreme Court in Manhattan granted their request yesterday, but state law grants the city an automatic stay from the adhering to the ruling.
