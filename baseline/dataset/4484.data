When Salvatore R. Curiale, New York State's Insurance Superintendent, started testifying today before a United States Senate subcommittee that was greatly skeptical about his job performance, his voice was so quiet that the committee chairman asked him to move up to the microphone.

Then Mr. Curiale's voice began to grow, with frustration, irritation and New York accent in tow. Soon he was gesturing passionately. And his carefully prepared eight-page statement gave way to a stream of vivid, fiery remarks that sought to fix blame for the troubles enmeshing the state's largest health insurer, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, with any number of people other than himself and the staff of the state Insurance Department.

The insurer's board was "recalcitrant and complacent," he told the committee. They company was "not managed well" and deeply entrenched in a "misguided" marketing strategy that "just cannot" succeed. He accused Empire officials, including nameless ones who he said were in the hearing room and not yet accused publicly of making false statements, of lying to him. And he predicted, "There will be heads that will be rolling." Blast of Commentary

For the usually retiring Mr. Curiale, who has spent his three years as superintendent almost completely out of the limelight, the testimony seemed to turn into a free-form public venting of sentiments he had largely kept to himself and that were not included in his prepared remarks.
