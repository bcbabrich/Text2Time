SUMMER is the best of seasons for food preparation. An abundance of herbs - fresh thyme, tarragon, chives, chervil - are ready for picking just outside my kitchen door. And I find pleasure, too, in cleaning and firing up my much-used outdoor grills, of which I have two: one for wood and charcoal, the other heated by gas. For cleaning the grill, I have a substantial metal brush nearby and put it to use while the grill is still hot; the retained heat eases the job. Occasionally I wash the grill with detergent and water to eliminate any charred bits of meat.

The choice of foods that I grill depends on what strikes my fancy when I visit the neighboring poultry farm, the meat counter of the supermarket or whatever. One morning I discovered a fine batch of large shrimp at the local fish market, alongside a display of supremely fresh salmon. I decided to regale my guests with a combination of the two. The marinade is easily put together, and the cooking time is five minutes or less.

As a side dish I recommend a gratin of summer vegetables. Grilled Salmon With Shrimp

1 1/2 pounds boneless fillet of salmon with skin left on 8 large shrimp, about 1/2 pound 1/4 cup olive oil Salt to taste if desired Freshly ground pepper to taste 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme 1/4 teaspoon dried hot red pepper flakes 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 3 tablespoons melted butter 2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley.

1.Preheat charcoal or gas grill, or broiler, to high. 2.Cut salmon into 4 pieces of equal size and set aside. 3.Place each shrimp on a flat surface and cut through back of shell, leaving shell and underside feelers intact. Open each shrimp butterfly fashion and devein. 4.Pour oil into a flat dish and add shrimp and salmon. Turn pieces to coat on all sides. Sprinkle all over with salt, pepper, thyme, pepper flakes and lemon juice. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature about 10 to 15 minutes. 5.When ready to cook, remove seafood from marinade. Pour marinade into small saucepan. If using a broiler, arrange salmon skin side up on a baking sheet. Place under broiler about 4 inches from source of heat.
