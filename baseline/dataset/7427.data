ST. PETERSBURG, March 31 —After losing to the Pittsburgh Pirates, 8—4, at Al Lang Field today, the New York Mets did a mountain of paper work concerning players. Actually, however, they moved only one man, a young pitcher named Mike Joyce.

They completed three conditional purchases made last fall, added Ed Bauta, a pitcher, to the Met roster, took Pat Garrett off, and acquired Joyce from the Chicago White Sox on waivers.

In a conditional purchase, a team pays a certain amount—perhaps $5,000—to examine the merchandise. If it wants to keep the player, it then pays the remainder of the agreed ‐ upon price.

This is the situation under which Amado Samuel, a shortstop; Bob Taylor, a catcher, and Larry Elliot, an outfielder, have been playing this spring. The Mets have decided to keep all three. So today they paid the rest of the money owed to Milwaukee for Samuel and Taylor ( a total estimated at $60,000 ), and to the Pittsburgh organization for Elliot.
