Ever since the generally influential residents of the block of West 67th Street just west of Central Park heard about plans to convert a mid block town house into a Jewish cultural and social center, they have been trying to stop it, or at least scale it down.

Such a center, the neighbors have argued, would attract potentially noisy young people to its restaurant and outdoor terrace, would generate too much trash and would be too big for the quiet, historic block, which they say is already congested because of the ABC television studios on West 67th Street and the Reebok gym on Columbus Avenue.

But the neighbors, who had formed the Coalition to Preserve the Westside Artists District and won a restraining order to stop demolition work, lost a round in court on Wednesday when Justice Louis B. York of State Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled that the Jewish Life Network, the foundation that is backing the center, does not have to provide an environmental impact assessment to go forward with its plans.

''We think it's too big,'' Alice LeBlanc, a co-trustee of the coalition and a resident of the block, said. ''Hundreds of people will be impacted. There's already double parking on the block because of ABC. We're just asking for someone to do an assessment.''
