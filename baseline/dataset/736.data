WEEN--Jeffrey (Jacob). Born in New York City on May 29, 1946, died December 28, 2013. We are heartbroken at the loss of our beloved Jacob. An extraordinary husband, stepfather, father-in-law, grandfather, family man and friend. Graduate of NYU Law and Oxford University, he had an untold impact, tirelessly fighting for tenants' and artists' rights throughout New York City for 35 years. He has taught us many lessons, including the imperative of performing daily acts of generosity and loving kindness. In lieu of flowers, donations should be made to IYYUN or The Mussar Institute.
