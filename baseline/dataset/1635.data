Paul Blart’s reign at the top of the box office came to an end over the weekend, toppled by the vigilante-father film “Taken,” starring Liam Neeson. That action movie, about a former C.I.A. operative on a mission to rescue his daughter from kidnappers in Paris, earned $24.6 million for 20th Century Fox in its first week in theaters, more than enough to push “Paul Blart: Mall Cop” (Columbia) into second place, according to the box office tracking firm Media by Numbers. “Paul Blart,” a comedy starring Kevin James as a formidable shopping mall security force, earned $13.9 million for a cumulative total of $83.3 million in three weeks. Paramount Pictures took the third and fourth spots: “Uninvited,” a horror movie starring David Strathairn and Elizabeth Banks, made $10.5 million in its first weekend, and “Hotel for Dogs” the adaptation of Lois Duncan’s 1971 story about children who save stray animals, made $8.706 million ($48.2 million to date). “Hotel” barely edged out Clint Eastwood’s “Gran Torino” which earned $8.7 million for Warner Brothers ($110.6 million to date).
