For a set, John Isner had reason to keep dreaming. He took the first set in his third-round match with the best player in the world. Then he woke up. Well, actually, Roger Federer woke up, rallying to win, 6-7 (4) 6-2, 6-4, 6-2.

Isner, the 6-foot-9 American, had 18 aces and 49 winners in all. But Federer started to do a better job of returning Isner’s booming serve in the second set, and the gap in their games became obvious. The Swiss jerked Isner around the court, drawing unforced errors galore as Isner grew tired. (Isner had 42 unforced errors to Federer’s 11.)

To Isner’s credit, Federer looked relieved more than anything after the match. Up next for Federer is the Spaniard Feliciano Lopez, who defeated the American Donald Young earlier in four tight sets.
