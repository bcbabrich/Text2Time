The traffic jams at the inaugural Brickyard 400 in Indianapolis next weekend will be nightmarish: a mass of cars trying to squeeze into a space only big enough for half of them, a rush hour lasting several hours in the morning and again in the afternoon, and drivers with frayed nerves coming close to losing control.

And those are just the race cars.

The motorized stampede was virtually guaranteed beginning on April 14, 1993, the day the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Nascar announced they had agreed to hold the first major stock-car race at the speedway. Later that year, the track sold out more than 280,000 seats as quickly as it could process the orders, guaranteeing that the Brickyard 400 next Saturday will have the largest crowd ever for a stock-car race.

The race purse of $3.2 million also makes the Brickyard 400 the richest stock-car race ever, beating the $2.7 million paid at the Daytona 500 in February. Not Just for the Southeast

Now, at last, the Winston Cup car owners and drivers will prove incontrovertibly what they have believed for years: that their form of racing is not just a Southeastern phenomenon but a world-class series that can tell Formula One -- and maybe even the Indianapolis 500 -- that it won't be satisfied with second place.
