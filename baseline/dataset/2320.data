(A weekly look at favorable matchups)

Harrison’s Turn

In the long career of Colts wide receiver MARVIN HARRISON, last week’s one catch for eight yards was one of his worst performances. The rookie running back JOSEPH ADDAI stole off with four touchdowns. Bad games make Harrison mad. The last time he had back-to-back poor ames was last season in Weeks 2 and 3. Against a Titans defense that has allowed 19 passing touchdowns, quarterback PEYTON MANNING is likely to look Harrison’s way and make him happy again.

Romo Familiar Foe

In a storybook year for Cowboys quarterback TONY ROMO, things will come full circle when he faces the Giants. Romo came on in relief of Drew Bledsoe in Week 7 and showed flashes of potential with 227 yards and 2 touchdowns in the second half. But no one could have expected his production since. Romo, a first-year starter out of Eastern Illinois, has thrown 10 touchdown passes and two interceptions and has a 110.8 passer rating, the best in the league and the fifth highest in league history if it holds up.

Need for Speed in St. Louis

When the mighty Rams offensive tackle ORLANDO PACE was

lost for the season, he seemed to take the team’s passing game

down with him. Since his injury three weeks ago, the team once

known as the Greatest Show on Turf has had only 228 yards

passing in two games. But predating the injury was the fall in

production from the star wide receiver TORRY HOLT, who has

not broken 100 yards or scored in a game since a big performance in Week 6 against the Seahawks. That should all change when the Rams face the Cardinals, a team that gives up 230.1 passing yards a game and allowed Holt to get eight catches for 120 yards and a touch-

down in Week 3.

Point of Emphasis in Pittsburgh

Steelers tight end HEATH MILLER, above, has been a bit of a disap-

pointment this season, with 27 catches for 329 yards and 3

touchdowns. He had six touchdowns in 15 starts as a rookie.

With wide receiver HINES WARD out for today’s game against

the Buccaneers, Miller should get more attention from quar-

terback BEN ROETHLISBERGER. Facing the 30th-ranked Bucs

passing defense won’t hurt.
