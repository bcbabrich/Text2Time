Will Deutsche Bank's $10.1 billion acquisition of Bankers Trust be the big banking merger that actually melds vastly different cultures, titanic egos and far-flung businesses?

Luckily for Bankers Trust shareholders, they need not wait around to find out. Because the deal is for cash rather than shares of Deutsche Bank, Bankers Trust shareholders can take the money and run.

And it is a tidy sum. According to the terms of the deal announced yesterday, shareholders in Bankers Trust will receive $93 a share in cash for a stock that was trading at about $62 a share two weeks ago. When the market swooned in early October, the shares had fallen to $49.1875 from the April high of $136.4375.

Deutsche Bank's price for Bankers Trust is equivalent to 2.3 times the book value of Bankers Trust and 15.8 times consensus earnings estimates for 1999 of $5.90 a share. The premium to book value is in line with the average price to book value -- 2.4 times -- that investors are now paying for shares of five big United States investment firms.
