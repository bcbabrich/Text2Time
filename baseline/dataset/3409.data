Anita Hoffman, who aided and abetted her Yippie husband, Abbie Hoffman, in his anti-establishment protests and pranks and then sustained him through her letters during his years as a fugitive, died on Sunday at the age of 56.

She had been suffering from breast cancer.

Mrs. Hoffman had lived in Petaluma, Calif., where she sold rare books. Until shortly before her death she continued to advise on the production of ''Steal This Movie,'' a film produced by Robert Greenwald that is scheduled for release next summer. It is based on letters she had exchanged with her husband during the six years he was sought by the F.B.I. on charges of selling cocaine. The exchanges appeared in a book, ''To America With Love: Letters from the Underground,'' not long before Mr. Hoffman committed suicide at 52 in 1989.

After Mr. Hoffman, the founder of the Yippie movement, jumped bail in 1974, Mrs. Hoffman and her son, america, who was deliberately named with a lower case a, became the objects of constant F.B.I. surveillance. For his part, Mr. Hoffman traveled in the United States and Europe and eventually settled with his companion, Johanna Lawrenson, in a remote hamlet in New York near the Thousand Islands, where under the name of Barry Freed he campaigned to protect the St. Lawrence River.

Fully aware of his relationship with Ms. Lawrenson, his wife wrote regularly and supportively, at one point helping him to find a psychiatrist to treat him for what was later described as schizophrenia and manic depression.
