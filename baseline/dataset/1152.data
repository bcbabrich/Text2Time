A Look at New York City, From 1940 to Today

Seven decades ago, The New York Times and several other newspapers produced a market analysis of 116 neighborhoods in New York City, based on the 1940 census. Now, The Times has compared the statistics and photographs from five sample neighborhoods as they appeared in 1940 and today. The City University of New York Mapping Service at the Center for Urban Research has republished the entire 1940s analysis online as a research aid.
