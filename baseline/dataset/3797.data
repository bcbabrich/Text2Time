To the Editor:

''Gateway to Madness'' (editorial, March 29) differentiates ''cults'' from ''mainstream faiths'' by citing the lack of ancient roots of the cults.

Not all mainstream faiths have ancient roots. The Mormon religion, for example, was founded in 1830. It should also be recognized that all religions began their existence as cults, and they were all subject to derision and persecution. Their eventual acceptance as ''religions'' was achieved only when they acquired some form of political power.
