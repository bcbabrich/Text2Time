For schnitzel or a cup of coffee or just for conversation, the Frank Sinatra, as students called the student center whose cafeteria was bombed today, drew the range of Hebrew University's visiting and full-time students: Italians, Americans, South Koreans, and Israeli Jews and Arabs.

Like the cafeteria, Hebrew University itself is one of the few places where Israel's Jews and its Arabs, who make up 20 percent of the country's population of six million, mix and freely debate their differences -- far more collegially than they do, for example, in Israel's fractious Parliament. Relations can be strained, students say, but they have remained peaceful on campus.

Before today. the current conflict had been felt on campus, not only in the sharpening political debate but also in the declining enrollment of Americans in the Rothberg International School, steps from the site of the bombing in the Frank Sinatra, which killed at least seven people and wounded more than 80.

Opened in 1925, Hebrew University has grown like the Jewish nationalism it sought to promote, and its history has paralleled Israel's own turbulent development. From 33 faculty members and 141 students, it has grown to include 1,400 senior faculty members and 23,000 full-time students spread over several campuses.
