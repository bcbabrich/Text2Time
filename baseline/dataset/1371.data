TUESDAY’S PUZZLE — Yesterday we engaged in the sweaty work of helping Joel Fagliano schlep works of ART across the grid, so I say we deserve a day off today. I don’t know about you, but I’m going to kick back and read a comic book.

Or am I? It looks like there’s some wordplay afoot here. Let’s start with the payoff today at 60 Across: the publisher of “Captain Marvel” comics is DC COMICS, and is also the home of some of the greatest superheroes of all time, like Batman, Superwoman, Green Lantern and many more.

And yet, that’s not quite where Albert R. Picallo is going. He has taken four famous comedians (yes, DICK CAVETT started his career in stand-up comedy), fit them into the grid along with the payoff, and as a final elegant touch, these comedians all apparently had self-titled specials or TV series at one time or another. Nicely done, Mr. Picallo.

With so much (and yet not enough) being done in green technology these days, one would think that the clue “Green machines” might have something to do with cleaning up the planet. Not today. Today it’s a very clever clue for ATM. I liked seeing the ARTFUL Dodger in the grid: one of my first schoolgirl crushes was on Jack Wild in that role in the movie “Oliver!” I also got a kick out of seeing the juxtaposition of the entries at 8- and 22 Down, where one can apparently be both flexible and inflexible about rules.

I was a huge fan of Dick Cavett’s PBS series, but I was an even bigger fan of his 1974 autobiography “Cavett,” which I read over and over until it was completely dog-eared. I especially loved his wry and witty style and his stories about being a writer in the Golden Era of television, but what sold me on the book were his stories of his friendship with Groucho Marx. It even includes his initial meeting with Mr. Marx on a New York City street, where he confessed that he was a big fan of the great man. Mr. Marx’s response, as you would expect, was “If it gets any hotter, I could use a big fan.”

Thanks for a Tuesday puzzle that made me smile for a lot of reasons, Mr. Picallo.
