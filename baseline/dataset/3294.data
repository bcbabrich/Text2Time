Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students explore the importance of weather prediction and the Internet’s role in changing the way weather is reported. By participating in an Internet scavenger hunt, students will come to a greater appreciation of the role weather prediction through the Internet plays in their own lives as well as the lives of people all over the world.

Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Share experiences with obtaining weather information.

2. Examine the ways in which the Internet has changed the way weather is reported by reading and discussing “All the Weather You Will Ever Need.”

3. Understand the format for correctly citing Web sites in bibliographies and compare this format to other bibliographical formats.

4. Locate and correctly cite Web sites related to weather forecasting and current conditions.

5. Locate, correctly cite, and briefly review two weather Web sites.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/ pencils

-classroom blackboard

-copies of “All the Weather You Will Ever Need” (one per student)

-copies of the worksheet “Storming the Web: An Internet Scavenger Hunt” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/lessons/000601thursday_ws.html) (one per student)

-computers with Internet access (at least one per every pair of students)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In the first five minutes of class, students respond to the following questions (written on the board prior to class): “Did you check a weather forecast this morning before going to school? How many times this week did you check a weather forecast before going to school? Which form of media do you most often use to check the weather: radio, television, newspaper, or Internet?” Tally the results of these questions on the board. Then, discuss what benefit students hope to derive from paying attention to weather forecasts and why they choose the medium they do (radio, television, newspaper, or Internet) for their weather information. What source do students think might contain the most information about current weather conditions and forecasts.

2. As a class, read and discuss “All the Weather You Will Ever Need,” focusing on the following questions:

a. What developments in weather reporting are especially exciting for Carey Hoffman?

b. What can you “listen to” on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Web site?

c. What keeps people interested in the weather, according to Dr. James Baker?

d. What are some of the features you can find on weather Web sites? What kind of people would need some of these features?

e. What does Doppler radar do? How could the information it provides be useful?

f. How has weather prediction changed in the past 85 years? How has it stayed the same?

g. How could knowing the weather in “real-time” be important for a sailor? A golfer? An astronomer?

h. What could be the benefits of having meteorologists debate their forecasts? What might be some drawbacks?

3. Distribute the worksheet “Storming the Web: An Internet Scavenger Hunt” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/lessons/000601thursday_ws.html) and discuss the format for correctly citing Web sites in bibliographies. Discuss what information in this type of bibliographical citation is similar to other bibliographical citations they have written.

4. Divide students into pairs (or, if there are enough computers for the entire class, students may work on their own), and allow each pair or student to sit at a computer that is displaying an Internet search engine, such as Yahoo!(//www.yahoo.com) or AltaVista (//www.altavista.com). Explain the scavenger hunt assignment as detailed on the worksheet. Then, ask students to try to find the first item and write a Web citation for it based on the format and example provided. Remind students to be particularly careful with punctuation. The teacher may need to help students find information once they have found appropriate Web pages. Most information will be found on the first page of the Web site. When a student has written the citation for the first item, he or she should raise his or her hand to notify the teacher, and the teacher should check the citation and correct it as necessary. Students should only be allowed to continue with the scavenger hunt/ Web citation activity after the teacher has reviewed the first item. Students should try to use the Web sites identified in the related Times article in finding the items in the scavenger hunt.

5. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: As indicated on the worksheet, each student should further explore two weather Web sites and write a brief review of each, comparing different features on each site and determining which site would meet his or her needs best.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–If Dr. Goldstein is right, and weather prediction is about as accurate as it was 85 years ago, why do we continue to develop newer and more expensive tools for measuring weather?

–Do you think that most people assume that the weather forecast is accurate, or do you think people understand the inaccuracy involved? Do you assume weather forecasts to be accurate? Are you upset with the forecaster when he or she is inaccurate? Why do inaccuracies occur?

–Why do you think some people are so fascinated by the weather that they will risk their lives following it (such as by “storm-chasing”)?

–What features would draw you to a weather Web site?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated on participation in class discussions, active participation in Web Scavenger Hunt, and thorough and thoughtful review of two weather Web sites.

Vocabulary:

meteorologist, barometer, Doppler, precipitation, culled

Extension Activities:

1. Refer to the sidebar accompanying the article “All The Weather You’ll Ever Need,” as well as sites you might find on the Internet, to create your own weather station. Classes may want to create a class weather station.

2. Chart a weather Web site for ten days and keep a log of the weather it predicted for your town and the actual weather on each day. Approximate the accuracy of the predictions. Was the accuracy less than or greater than the average 85 percent?

3. Visit the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration site (//www.noaa.gov) and “listen in” on a conversation between meteorologists. Write down three facts you learned that you would not have learned from a regular weather forecast.

4. Read a book about meteorology (such as “Air Apparent: How Meteorologists Learned to Map, Predict and Dramatize Weather” or “The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Weather”) to learn more about the field of meteorology. You might also research a weather phenomenon and create a “How It Works” poster, or create a weather book geared towards younger children.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Current Events- Research a recent or current natural disaster (flood, hurricane, fire, tornado). Based on the information you find, create a pamphlet describing the effects of the weather condition and explaining what to do in the case of such an event (make sure to cite the Web sites or other sources you used to get your information).

Fine Arts- Using the Web site PastWeather.com and other sites to collect data, create your own weather map depicting the weather conditions in the United States on your birthday or another significant day during this past year. You may want to use the standard colors used by meteorologists to depict certain weather conditions, or create your own color scheme. Create a key to indicate what your colors represent.

Global History- Research how different civilizations throughout time have collected data on weather. Create a visual display depicting some of the tools and procedures used, indicating where and when each was created and used.
