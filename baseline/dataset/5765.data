To the Editor:

We badly need tax reform, but everyone and every group has a different plan. Many are plans that say, ''Don't tax me; tax someone else.''

It has been aptly said that the power to tax is the power to destroy. So, let's do it right and destroy no one!

I believe that we need a tax commission, staffed with the best brains in the United States, to study our tax system and ways to improve it, and, above all, to simplify it.

The President has had experience assembling such a commission to study spending. The commission did a splendid job and did it for nothing. But that took more than a year of intensive study and 2,000 volunteers. It was called the Grace Commission.
