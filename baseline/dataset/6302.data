Can Work in Plainclothes

With permission of the pre cinct's commanding officer, the team will also be allowed to operate in plainclothes to deal with such problems as purse snatchers outside the shops on Utica Avenue. Nor mally orders for patrolmen to work in plainclothes require the approval of the Police Commissioner himself, which rarely can be obtained in less than three days.

Also in the interest of greater versatility, patrolmen in radio cars in the sector will be allowed to park their cars and move about on foot. Under ordinary circum stances, policemen assigned to radio cars are never al lowed to patrol on foot.

Except for the, trip to the pharmacy, the business of the team's first day in action fol lowed a normal police pat tern. There was a New Year's Eve reveler who needed help up his icy front steps at 10 o'clock in the morning, a mother of three who gave herself an overdose of drugs and had to be rushed to the hospital, a wife who com plained that her estranged husband had punched her in the mouth, and a false alarm reporting a wounded police man.

New Service Heralded

Along the way, Sergeant Ambrose did his best to spread the word that some thing new was happening. But when he answered a radio call by saying, “This is the beat commander in the 77th,” an incredulous voice at the other end retorted: “The what?”

“It will take us a few days to get our terminology squared away,” the sergeant explained.

He was received with greater recognition by a woman who was visiting a rear apartment on Buffalo Avenue that had been bur glarized. She remembered that she had seen his picture the other day in a newspaper. “What's my name?” he asked.

“I didn't read that far,” said the woman.

“Well, it's Ambrose, Ser geant Ambrose. Remember it now. If you have any prob lems, we'll be here to help you.”

“Tell you the truth,” the woman said, “I protect my self. I keep pots of lye and ammonia in my apartment. Anyone who tries to get in will be sorry.”
