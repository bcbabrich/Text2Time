Governor Eliot Spitzer and his wife, Silda, climbed the 77 steps up to the eastern entrance of the Capitol, where they were greeted by former Gov. George E. Pataki and his wife, Libby. As the two couples chatted and posed for pictures, the overcast skies suddenly lightened, giving a hint that the sun was up there somewhere.

“It’s a prospect of things to come,’’ Mr. Spitzer said. Mr. Pataki smiled.

Then the two couples went into the Capitol for a brief meeting.
