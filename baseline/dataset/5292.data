That strange hybrid of politics and entertainment, the televised political drama, made its explosive debut here this week, bringing with it spontaneity, name calling, rapid-fire dialogue and the oddly American phenomenon of pop political stardom.

What the Army-McCarthy hearings did for Joseph Welch, what the Watergate hearings did for John Dean and Sam Ervin and what the Iran-contra hearings did for Oliver North, the 19th Communist Party conference is doing for the likes of Vladimir I. Melnikov, Vladimir P. Kabaidze and Mikhail A. Ulyanov.

Korotich, editor of the feisty weekly magazine Ogonyok, handed Mr. Gorbachev documents that he said contained the names of four bribe-takers, all of them delegates to the conference.
