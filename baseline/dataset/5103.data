WHEN the latest upward explosion in stock prices began, the portfolio managers who run mutual funds were much more bullish than the investors in the funds. But the investors seem to have gotten the bullish religion in April, fund managers say.

The cash reserve in equity mutual funds stood at just 8.7 percent of assets at the end of March, according to figures provided by the Investment Company Institute, a trade group. That was down from 9 percent a month earlier and is the lowest level for cash reserves in more than three years.

The relative bullishness of the portfolio managers was in stark contrast to the attitude of mutual fund buyers, who continued to take cash out of equity funds in March, albeit at a slower pace than in February.

In April, however, the investors seem to have climbed on the bandwagon, two major mutual fund managers said. ''New sales of equity funds are up 25 percent in April from March, and are running at double the rate of December,'' said Michael J. Hines, a spokesman for the Fidelity group of funds. At T. Rowe Price, Steve Norwitz also said money flowed into equity funds in April.
