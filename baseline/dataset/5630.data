On the afternoon of Sept. 19, President Reagan held an unscheduled White House meeting with the Soviet Foreign Minister to express, in blunt, sometimes angry, words, his displeasure that the Soviet Union was refusing to let an American journalist return to the United States, according to an Administration official.

In the midst of the meeting, the Soviet official, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, surprised Mr. Reagan with a personal letter from Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader.

According to a high-ranking Administration official, the final paragraph of the letter especially stirred Mr. Reagan's interest. It asked for a meeting in the next few weeks between the two leaders, a meeting that would be a prelude to Mr. Gorbachev's visit to the United States late this year or early in 1987.

Strong Link to Daniloff

''The President thought it was a good idea but we weren't about to accept it until the Daniloff issue was settled satisfactorily,'' said the official, referring to Nicholas S. Daniloff, the U.S. News & World Report correspondent. The message that Mr. Reagan would agree to a two-day meeting with Mr. Gorbachev, despite the President's stated view that a full-blown summit meeting was out of the question during the Congressional election campaign, was given to the Soviet Foreign Minister the next day.
