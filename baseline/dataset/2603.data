A design featuring two stainless-steel walls that look from a certain perspective as if the World Trade Center towers had been neatly felled and had landed in New Jersey has won the competition for New Jersey's Sept. 11 memorial, Gov. James E. McGreevey announced yesterday. The winning proposal came from the Manhattan-based architect Frederic Schwartz.

The design for the memorial, which is to be built directly across the Hudson River from ground zero at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, was the unanimous choice of a panel that represented the families of the nearly 700 New Jersey victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, officials said.

Mr. Schwartz's memorial, ''Empty Sky,'' is reminiscent of Maya Lin's Vietnam War memorial in Washington. It has two facing walls of brushed stainless steel with the names of each New Jersey victim engraved on them. As Mr. Schwartz's firm put it: ''Individuals' names are within easy reach and engraved deep enough for hand rubbing. The lettering size is three and three-quarter inches high, in Times New Roman, a familiar and easy-to-read typeface.''

Each wall will be 30 feet high and 200 feet long, as long as each World Trade Center tower was wide. The walls' proportions will be the same as those of the twin towers if they were lying on their sides. And the surfaces of the steel walls will reflect the changing light of day, as the towers once did. At night the memorial will be illuminated so beams of light shoot into the sky.
