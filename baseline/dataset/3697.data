An armed robbery at a Brooklyn gas station was foiled yesterday by an off-duty police sergeant who witnessed the robbery, chased down the suspect and shot him once in the leg during a furious struggle before arresting him, the police said.

Sgt. Raymond Martinez, a 10-year veteran who was promoted to sergeant on Friday, was driving to his post at the department's Housing Bureau at 6:30 A.M. yesterday when he saw a robbery in progress at a Citygas Station on Atlantic Avenue near Hale Street in the Highland Park section, the police said.

During the robbery, the gas station attendant, Xavinder Singh, 26, was shot once in the foot before the gunman fled on a bicycle, said Sgt. Gerry Falcon, a department spokeswoman. Sergeant Martinez chased the suspect in his car and caught him a few blocks away, the police said.

In a struggle, Sergeant Martinez shot the suspect once in the left shin, the police said. The suspect, David Golden, 35, of Brooklyn, was arrested, and a .380-caliber handgun was seized from him at the scene, Sergeant Falcon said.
