There are just so many of them, from Diesel to Dior. The window shoppers peeped at the ornate Victoria's Secret, more burlesque show than store, and fogged up the display cases at the 13,000-square-foot Tourneau Time Dome, the largest watch store in the country. Collectors bought Las Vegas keepsakes, ranging from a $3.99 magnet depicting the "Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas" sign, for sale at Magnets Maximus, to a $320 pair of crystal dice, sold only in the Las Vegas outlet of Baccarat, the French crystal company. And even I had specialty shops to get excited about - like Giuseppe Zanotti, the Italian shoemaker, and Scoop NYC, the chic sportswear boutique - neither of which has an outpost in Los Angeles.

Despite the thick mass of people meandering around the Forum, the higher-end shops were deserted. (No worry: One high roller a day will meet the store's quota.) In the mod and colorful Emilio Pucci store, a salesperson pounced the moment I paused in front of a large, $690 handbag - hoping, no doubt, that I was today's big spender. "Fabulous. Bluebell print. You must have it, no?"

I demurred, and after a few more failed attempts, he found readier prey in a woman who asked to try on some down-filled moon boots for $250. Moments later, as the woman handed over her credit card, I asked her where she was from. "Western Florida," she said. Where it gets cold enough for moon boots? "It's a souvenir."

This was no ordinary shopping mall.

I could not say the same for the Fashion Show Mall, the other major shopping center on the Strip. It is huge: two million square feet, to be exact. It has over 250 stores, including Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom, an Apple store, and some smaller boutiques like Talulah G, which stocks the hard-to-find Chloe calfskin Paddington Bag for $1,200 and True Religion jeans, which start at $182. But without significant shoppertainment - save its 80-foot rising runway that features flashy fashion shows three days a week - you could be anywhere, to which I say: if you're going to be anywhere, you might as well get a discount. The Fashion Outlets of Las Vegas, a 30-minute drive from the Strip, in Primm, a town on the California border, offer merchandise similar to that at the Fashion Show's Neiman Marcus, BCBG and Cole Haan shops, for discounts of 50 and 60 percent.

It was time to hit the Wynn. In 1998, when Mr. Wynn opened the Via Bellagio, it was the first to lure such luxury retailers as Chanel, Giorgio Armani, Herm√®s and Prada to a Las Vegas resort. Since then, new high-end stores have appeared in lesser resorts, the Forum Shops have expanded (though the Gucci at the Bellagio, placed next to its Italian rivals, Fendi and Prada, seems more alluring than its Forum counterpart) and Mr. Wynn has sold the Bellagio.

Anticipating Steve Wynn's personal one-upmanship was making me wildly curious, so I hopped a cab for the 1.4-mile ride up Las Vegas Boulevard to the Wynn Las Vegas. Eleven minutes later, I arrived at the entrance, which I made the mistake of bypassing in order to visit the Penske-Wynn Ferrari-Maserati dealership at the other end of the grand circular drive. A warning: you can only access the showroom from inside the casino, and the line can be as long as the one for a Cirque du Soleil show. And if you're in the market for a new Ferrari (they start at around $200,000), you'll have to wait for that, too; the dealership's allotment was sold out within two months of opening.

I'm not sure what I was expecting when I finally arrived at the Wynn Esplanade. A majestic choir, perhaps? An astounding array of luxury boutiques I had always wanted to shop in? Or relief for my aching feet? There was no choir, and although I spotted the first Las Vegas retail branches of Oscar de la Renta, Jean Paul Gaultier and Manolo Blahnik among the hallway of marquee-name shops, it was the comfort of the plush, parasol-patterned carpet beneath my feet that truly impressed. There was also a calm about the place, as if it were miles away from the din of the casino.

What differentiates the Wynn Esplanade is the Wynn experience. If there's a theme, it's "our palace is your palace." Shoppers and gawkers are equally represented, gazing up at the fabric-covered domes and pausing in front of the lush greenery.

Inside Cartier, when I said I was "just looking," I was given a glass of champagne and shown a specialty dice charm for $3,150, made exclusively for the Wynn. You don't even need money: in Chanel, a woman without a purse paid $1,795 for one just by showing her room key. I was studying a case of yellow diamonds at Graff, the London-based jeweler, when a middle-aged man in shorts, socks and sandals came in. "I was just hoping to take a picture of the marble floor," he said.

The salespeople smiled warmly. "No problem." You never know: anyone could be a jackpot winner.

I found real cash transactions going down at the Wynn Signature store, where anything with the resort's logo - like a $28 baseball hat, $6 shot glass, or $2.50 tin of Wynn mints - was flying off the shelves.

Back in the designer store lineup, I caught myself peering into the window of Louis Vuitton, the French store that is so ubiquitous that I had already passed two others earlier that day, at the Fashion Show Mall and the Caesars Forum Shops. But because of these serene surroundings, the perfectly controlled mild temperature, and the relative comfort of the carpeted floor, it was the siren song of the Wynn Esplanade's Louis Vuitton that made me an offer I apparently couldn't refuse.

So, while I may never have occasion to carry an indigo patent leather clutch, I now own one for $580. We'll call it a souvenir.
