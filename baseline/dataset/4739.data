One of the nation's best-known scholars in African-American studies has been hired by Harvard, the university announced yesterday.

Henry Louis Gates Jr., whose specialty is African-American literature, became the John Spencer Basset professor of English at Duke University last fall after five years as a professor at Cornell University. He will join the Harvard faculty, with a joint appointment in the departments of English and Afro-American Studies, this summer, pending approval by the university's governing boards. He will also direct Harvard's W. E. B. DuBois Institute for Afro-American Research.

The 39-year-old professor has made a speciality of rediscovering and publishing the works of 19th-century black female writers. He has also written extensively about slave narratives and about black dialect.
