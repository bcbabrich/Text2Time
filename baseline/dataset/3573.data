Barbara May's pillows, which have appeared in a Toni Braxton video, create live-video lipstick colors and iridescence by layering silks. An inside pillow case is taffeta. The outside, looser, cover is sheer organza. The pillows come in 16- and 22-inch squares, at $100 and $150, exclusively from Escabelle, 273 Lafayette Street (Prince Street); (212) 941-5925.
