Voters in New Jersey who cast absentee ballots for a candidate who has dropped out of the presidential race can vote again, a state judge has ruled. The ruling by the judge, Vincent J. Grasso of State Superior Court in Ocean County, dealt specifically with the Ocean County Clerk but has bearing statewide, according to the New Jersey attorney general’s office.

The ballot for Tuesday’s presidential primary was printed about a month ago. Because the field of candidates has narrowed considerably since then in both parties, the ballot has the names of six candidates who are no longer running. The candidates include four Democrats, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, and two Republicans, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York and former Senator Fred D. Thompson of Tennessee.

Under Judge Grasso’s ruling, if someone cast their absentee ballot for one of those six candidates, they are allowed to request a new ballot from their county clerk’s office and revote.

David Wald, a spokesman for Attorney General Anne Milgram, said New Jersey law does not specifically address whether absentee voters can vote again if their first choice for a candidate was eliminated before the election.

“There’s a gap in the statute on this particular question,” Mr. Wald said.

To avoid counting two ballots from the same person, Mr. Wald said county clerks have safeguards in place. The clerk’s office will flag the replacement ballot, and then provide a list of names of all the voters who have requested a replacement ballots to the local board of elections, which counts the ballots.

And even before the clerk issues a replacement ballot, they would have to sign an affidavit swearing that they are voting again because their first choice is no longer in the race.

Mr. Wald said on Friday that he had heard anecdotal reports from county clerks across the state that they had so far received only a handful of request for replacement absentee ballots.
