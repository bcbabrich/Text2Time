A major coffee importing group yesterday threw its weight behind the contention of seven European steamship companies that they have a right to participate in the movement of beans to the United States.

The Green Coffee Association of New York wired Thomas Mann, Assistant Secretary for American Affairs in the State Department, to protest a Brazilian Government ruling that would limit "third flag carriers" to 20 per cent of the coffee traffic. The regulation, scheduled to become effective today, would automatically allocate 80 per cent of the traffic to United States flag lines and the Brazilian national line, Lloyd Brazileiro. Lloyd would get 40 per cent.

The Brazilian regulation promises to develop into one of considerable international proportion, since the European carriers consider it a “discriminatory” measure which affronts the traditional concept of “freedom of the seas.” One of the Norwegian companies involved, Nopal Line, has carried almost 30 per cent of the coffee traffic to United States Gulf ports.

Protects Brazil Line

The measure was designed to protect Lloyd Brazileiro, which according to maritime and coffee trade sources, has heretofore enjoyed a minor share in the traffic due to inadequacies such as an infrequent service.
