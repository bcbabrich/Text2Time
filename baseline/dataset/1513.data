Everyone knows that aging a spirit transforms it from fiery youthfulness to softly purring maturity, with the requisite increase in prestige and price to match. The mixologist Tony Conigliaro, who owns 69 Colebrooke Row in London’s Islington district, has been taking the process a step further, aging fully prepared cocktails.

Conigliaro often employs technology in his concoctions. He has pitted his creativity against the Japanese fusion cuisine at Shochu Lounge and Heston Blumenthal’s epic molecular dishes at the Fat Duck. One of his more intriguing experiments, however, is in a decidedly low-tech vein. Curiosity about the science behind what time can do to the flavors in a drink has led him to sit on batches of Manhattans, El Presidentes and, soon to come, Harvard cocktails (effectively a Manhattan made with Cognac), all of which are maturing in bottles in his cellar.

The idea, he says, came to him from a very old bottle of vermouth. “I was given a bottle of Dubonnet from the 1920’s by a bar-owner friend in Spain,” he recalls. “It had aged in the bottle and become exquisite, complex beyond words! I had some very old bourbon, and another friend donated some Boker’s bitters from around 1900, so I thought, ‘Why not make a cheeky vintage Manhattan?’ It wasn’t the best Manhattan ever, but the seed was sown. I wondered: Would a cocktail age in bottle?”

He put down 20 trials, batching each drink with its proper ratio, and tasted them every now and again. To some he added barrel staves. At six months he found nothing earth-shaking; “Most were pretty awful,” he admits, “particularly those with the staves. The martinis were okay, but died really quickly. The rusty nails were interesting, but not interesting enough. And then I forgot all about them until cleaning out the cellar nearly a year after laying them down. I thought I’d better taste them before throwing them out.” The manhattan had become smoother, with the bourbon, vermouth and bitters all magnificently integrated — in a manner so vastly different from the basic cocktail, Conigliaro says, “it was astonishing.”

It’s been five years since he launched a program of laying down drinks in 48-bottle batches every six months, and selling them as limited-edition vintages when he feels they’re ready. “At 5 years they have become so smooth and mellow, they’re way beyond my expectations,” he says. “It will be great to taste them at ten, fifteen years — if temptation doesn’t mean we drink them all.”

Jeffrey Morganthaler, who runs the bar at Clyde Common in the Ace Hotel in Portland, Ore., and also writes an engaging cocktail blog, was in London for Rumfest last October and found himself sitting at 69 Colebrook Row, appreciatively sipping one of Conigliaro’s vintage manhattans. “Being American, I thought to myself, ‘How can we age this more, and faster, make it taste really different?’”

He, too, began with the manhattan, he says, simply because that’s what he’d had at 69 Colebrooke Row. “I had a one-gallon cask laying around that had previously held Madeira, so I filled it with manhattan,” he says. The hardest part, according to Morganthaler, was convincing his boss that gambling with several hundred dollars’ worth of good spirits was worth the risk. “We aged it for two months and then popped it open: amazing — sold out in four days.” After that, he says, came the deluge.

He moved on to casking several favorite cocktails, including the Trident and the El Presidente, settling on the Negroni as a house favorite. “I knew you could get used Tuthilltown barrels from New York, so we got a two-gallon bourbon barrel from them and did Negronis. It was a completely different drink; the vermouth seems to oxidize, gets sweeter, the Campari softens a bit, and the finish is all wood and whiskey.”

Emboldened by the response to his experiments, Morganthaler says the next step is to transmogrify some of his own creations. “At first, people didn’t understand what we were doing. But after I explained it, and particularly in my blog, they’ve been going pretty much nuts for it,” he says. “I’m sure part of it is, Portland is one of those cities where people are constantly looking for something brand-new and exciting.” It would seem old and exciting works just as nicely.
