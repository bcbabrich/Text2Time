The Niagara Mohawk Power Company is offering $150 million in first-mortgage bonds with a maturity of March 1, 2021, through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.

The bonds have a 9 1/2 percent coupon and are priced at 99.133 to yield 9.588 percent, or about 145 basis points more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity.

Niagara Mohawk, based in Syracuse, plans to use the proceeds to help finance its construction program and reduce short-term debt, and for general corporate purposes.

Noncallable for five years, the bonds are rated Baa-2 by Moody's and BBB by Standard & Poor's.
