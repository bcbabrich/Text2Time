A Federal judge dismissed bribery and tax fraud charges against Meade H. Esposito yesterday, ruling that that the 83-year-old former Brooklyn Democratic leader was unable to assist in his defense because of his age and medical condition.

Judge Jack B. Weinstein made the ruling in Federal District Court in Brooklyn after three witnesses testified that the once-gregarious Mr. Esposito often sat in a darkened office and stared into space, sometimes fell asleep during important conversations and while having lunch, and could not remember recent events. But they added that he could recall political and other matters that happened long ago. Mr. Esposito has cancer, bleeding ulcers and other ailments.

A business partner, John Martuscello, who like Mr. Esposito has a 45 percent interest in the Manhattan insurance concern of Serres Visone & Rice, testified that Mr. Esposito sometimes acted ''very strangely.'' Dominic F. Amorosa, a lawyer for Mr. Esposito's daughter, Phyllis A. Zito, described Mr. Esposito's inability to retain his concentration or to recall what was said recently as ''very scary.''

''This man is incapable of defending himself at this point,'' said Mr. Esposito's lawyer, James M. LaRossa, who also testified at the hearing. Indicted a Year Ago
