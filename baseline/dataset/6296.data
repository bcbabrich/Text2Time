When you talk about the best tennis player of 1970, you run into a muddle. Rod Laver won more money and more tournaments but not the big ones. Ken Rosewall captured the United States Open and reached the final of Wimbledon. John New combe won Wimbledon, and Tony Roche the United States professional championship.

Each of these players topped somebody's poll last year, so that doesn't help. Maybe the start of the $210, 000 Tennis Champtions Clas sic at noon today in Madison Square Garden between La ver and Rosewall will help clear up things.

Just as last year, the win ner of today's match gets $10,000; the loser nothing. Roche and Newcombe will also play each other in an eight‐game pro set, but it will not count in the tournament. A doubles contest is also scheduled.

The winner ‐ take ‐ all con cept allows a player to pick up $170,000 if he sweeps all 12 matches, win a semifinal for $15,000 and the final for $35,000. However, with nine outstanding men in the field, the chances for that are slim.
