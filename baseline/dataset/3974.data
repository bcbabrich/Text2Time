This is the story that asks the question: Can a woman who has endured heartache, death, disease, infidelity and evil not only survive 40 years of virtually unalloyed tsoris but also celebrate it?

You bet!

Just ask HELEN WAGNER, because tomorrow she'll be around to kick up her heels when "As the World Turns" turns 40.

For all those years, ever since April 2, 1956, Miss Wagner, 78, has played Nancy Hughes of the fictional Oakdale, evolving from suburban Chicago mother to great-grandmother even as the relentless tides of the CBS soap opera swirled menacingly about her.

Miss Wagner can only regard 40 years of "As the World Turns" and her own professional good fortune with awe.
