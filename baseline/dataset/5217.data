In separate testimony, a G.S.A. official, Thomas H. McQuown, said that an employee of U S West, Karl Payne, told him that Mr. Soni had given the A.T.&T. pricing information to U S West, BellSouth and Bell Atlantic.

Mr. McQuown also said in his deposition that Mr. Soni had instructed his secretary to make copies of A.T.&T.'s bid proposal. Under G.S.A. rules, all copies have to be provided by the bidder, not made by the agency, because the bids are supposed to remain secret. Mr. McQuown also said that Mr. Soni had suggested to him that they should convince the regional companies to lower their bids below A.T.&T.'s final offer, which was submitted before the final bids of most competitors. Prohibition on Meals

Separately, the Pacific Telesis Group, which won a switch contract in San Francisco, said last week that one of its marketing managers bought two meals for Mr. Soni. The G.S.A. prohibits employees from accepting meals from potential bidders.

The recent diclosure that agency officials knew that the regional companies had access to A.T.&T.'s price information but did not prevent them from bidding heightens existing concerns about the agency's ability to conduct an impartial procurement. The G.S.A. has said that, to its knowledge, Mr. Soni is the only agency employee for which there are substantial allegations of misconduct. But it now appears, according to last week's testimony, that other G.S.A. officials are involved.

Although the current dispute centers on the phone-switch contracts, it is seen as jeopardizing the Government's plans to replace its antiquated telephone system with an ultra-modern communications network at a cost of about $25 billion. Bids for the FTS-2000 contracts, which represent billions of dollars in revenues to telecommunications and computer concerns, are due by the end of March. Ameritech Inquiries Cited

Two G.S.A. employees testified that the agency had received what they concluded was an inquiry from Ameritech about A.T.&.T's bid.

Reva Hutchinson, who supervised the switch contract bidding, said that a G.S.A. cost evaluator informed her about a call from an Ameritech official, Bud Sheldon. The cost evaluator told Ms. Hutchinson that Mr. Sheldon had called her and asked about A.T.&T.'s proposed pricing. Mr. Sheldon mentioned the $40 price to the cost evaluator. Ms. Hutchinson testified that the cost evaluator had said she did not think it was appropriate information for Mr. Sheldon to have because it was A.T.&T.'s bid price.
