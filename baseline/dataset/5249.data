Pre-Hippie Standards

Mary Cleere Haran, the Ballroom, 253 West 28th Street (244-3005). A native San Franciscan, Mary Cleere Haran applies her warm, lightly textured pop-jazz voice to standards that run from ''Embraceable You'' (interpreted with a strength and power reminiscent of Ella Fitzgerald in her prime) to slippery-seductive renditions of ''Lorelei'' and ''Glow Worm'' that recall Lee Wiley. As witty as her singing is fluent, Ms. Haran's between-song commentary tells of growing up in the hippie counterculture while harboring a secret love for the pre-rock music with which she obviously empathizes. A first-rate backing trio that includes Lee Musiker (on piano), Jay Leonhart (on bass) and Grady Tate (on drums) adds to her luster, making this the year's most exciting new cabaret act. Show times are 11 P.M. tonight and tomorrow and next Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Tickets are $15 to $25 (for ringside seating), and there is a two-drink minimum. Rhythm-and-blues at 60

Ruth Brown, Michael's Pub, 211 East 55th Street (758-2272). ''Miss Rhythm'' at age 60 is not all that different from when she was in her early 20's and scoring classic rhythm-and-blues hits like ''Teardrops From My Eyes,'' ''5-10-15 Hours,'' and ''Mama, He Treats Your Daughter Mean.'' Ruth Brown's voice is as solid as a rock, her ebullience unmuted and her musical intelligence acute. In addition to reprises of some of her early hits, Miss Brown brings quite refined jazz shading to an extended medley of ballads associated with Billie Holiday and Dinah Washington. Show times are at 9:30 and 11:30 tonight and tomorrow. There is a $15 cover charge and a two-drink minimum. Scottish Wizard

Silly Wizard, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street (864-5400). Silly Wizard, one of Scotland's premier traditional bands, performs an array of Celtic folk tunes as well as original traditionally flavored material. The group includes John Cunningham (a leading Scottish fiddler), his younger brother Phil (accordionist and keyboardist), Andy Stewart (tenor vocals and songwriter), Gordon Jones (guitarist and bodhran player) and Martin Hadden (bassist). Show time is tomorrow at 8 P.M. Tickets are $15 and $12.50.
