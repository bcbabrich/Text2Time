Residents of Boulder, Colo., the often-kooky Rocky Mountain town of about 95,000, think nothing of day-tripping up the face of a nearby fourteener (climbers’ parlance for a 14,000-foot-and-up peak). Perhaps that’s why, once they’ve descended back to civilization, traveling a few miles uptown to sample the city’s latest shops and restaurants doesn’t seem like much of a hike. But it’s a trip worth taking. As the downtown area and its Pearl Street Mall have grown crowded with national chains, upstart small businesses are flocking to North Boulder, or NoBo, giving rise to a neighborhood newly worthy of a stroll — no trekking poles necessary.
