HBO has picked up to pilot 40, an ensemble comedy from Entourage creator/executive producer Doug Ellin co-starring Ed Burns.

The show, set in New York, revolves around four lifelong friends who help each other navigate life at 40, which isn’t all they expected it to be. Burns will play one of them, married with kids guy, who used to work at Bear Stearns making over 2 million a year but has now been out of work for almost a year. The quartet also includes a rich metrosexual guy, a a ripped personal trainer and a schlumpy neurotic married guy.The project falls under Ellin’s overall deal with HBO.

40 joins HBO’s recent pilot orders to Armando Ianucci’s Veep starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Aaron Sorkin’s untitled News Show project. Entourage‘s eighth and final season airs this summer.
