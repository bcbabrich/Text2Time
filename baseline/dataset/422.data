On Monday, Saint Laurent announced that it had appointed Anthony Vaccarello as creative director, following the exit of Hedi Slimane. Here’s what to know about the 33-year-old designer, who will present his first collection for the house in October.

He’s Belgium-Born and Bred

Born in Belgium to Italian parents, Vaccarello studied at the art-and-design school La Cambre in Brussels and graduated in 2006; that year, he took home the top fashion prize at the annual Hyères Festival in France, which focuses on emerging talent. He worked on furs at Fendi for two years before founding his own brand and held his first runway show in September 2010 for the spring 2011 season. He won France’s ANDAM (Association Nationale pour le Développement des Arts de la Mode) award, for up-and-coming names, the following July. Since then, Vaccarello has continued to participate in the Paris calendar; his shows are typically scheduled for the first day of the French capital’s fashion week. It remains unclear if he’ll be shuttering his label upon taking the reins at Saint Laurent.
