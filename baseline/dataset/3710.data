''That is certainly the poltergeist energy that contributes to this radical vortex,'' he explained.

Mr. Levitch was treating a reporter to his personal take on the wondrous island of Manhattan, cradle to so many eccentrics like him. But his exuberantly articulated vision was more than just another oddball perspective; it was the warped window through which thousands of visitors over the last seven years have first glimpsed New York City.

Mr. Levitch, 28, may well be the most unorthodox, unusual tour guide the city has ever spawned, a distinction confirmed by the upcoming release of a feature-length documentary that focuses exclusively on him and principally on his long stint as an employee atop double-decker buses.

The movie, ''The Cruise,'' is scheduled to open on Oct. 23 at the Angelika Film Center in the Village. For a documentary to get a commercial theatrical release is atypical -- an immediate badge of success -- but ''The Cruise'' has also attracted sizeable audiences and garnered extremely positive reviews at the screenings and film festivals where it has been shown in the last few months.

And it has already begun to turn Mr. Levitch into something of a demi-celebrity and cult figure -- for the next 15 minutes, at least -- with friends in the movie industry, a literary agent and a budding business in privately arranged walking tours. He quit the double-decker scene a year ago but still takes small groups around Manhattan on foot.

That is, if they can find him. He has not had a permanent residence since 1992, relying instead on the hospitality of friends to support a mode of living he refers to as ''couch surfing.'' It prompts him to evaluate new acquaintances in idiosyncratic ways.
