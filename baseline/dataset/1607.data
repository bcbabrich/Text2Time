Tuesday’s meeting in Tampa, Fla., between the Yankees, Derek Jeter and his agent was set in motion when the agent, Casey Close, called Hal Steinbrenner, the team’s managing partner, and suggested that the sides get together in an attempt to break Jeter’s contract stalemate.

So for several hours on Tuesday evening, Jeter, Close and a lawyer working for the agent met with a Yankees contingent that included Steinbrenner, General Manager Brian Cashman and the team’s president, Randy Levine, said a person in baseball with knowledge of the meeting.

That person, who asked to remain anonymous because he did not want to jeopardize his access to confidential information, said that while no real progress was made on narrowing the substantial financial gap between the sides, the tenor of the meeting was cordial and that both sides will try to keep it that way.

“It wasn’t working the other way,” said a second person with knowledge of the meeting. That person was referring to the fact that each side had chosen to state its case in various newspaper articles over the last 10 days and that, as a result, the climate of the talks had taken on an edge.

That, in turn, apparently led Close to call Steinbrenner and try to get the talks back into a more productive setting.

It was Close who nearly two weeks ago described the Yankees’ bargaining position as “baffling’’ because he felt it did not account for Jeter’s overall contributions to the Yankees.

That statement angered Cashman, who days later responded with surprisingly blunt references to Jeter’s advancing age and declining on-field performance. Cashman said both issues had to be addressed in any new contract.

The public back and forth is likely to cease, at least for now. But the financial gap between the sides remains, with the Yankees offering Jeter a three-year, $45 million deal and Jeter, through Close, seeking a four- or five-year deal averaging $23 million to $24 million a year.
