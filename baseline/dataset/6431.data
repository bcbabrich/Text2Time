On billboards throughout the Twin Cities area, Joe Kapp smiles. Next to him is the slogan, “Joe Kapp Can't Lose with Instant Interest,” a message from a local bank.

Wherever he is, Joe Kapp probably is smiling. He usually is. But ironically, pro football followers are losing interest in him. As the Minnesota Vikings routed the New York Jets, 52‐21, on Sunday night, Joe Kapp had become the forgotten quar terback. With the season less than three weeks away, he is a free agent after having exercised the option clause in his contract. Following the breakdown in salary negotia tions with the Vikings about a month ago, he has remained incommunicado. Ap parently he is not going to be playing this year.

“I don't even know where he is right now,” Kapp's lawyer, John Elliott Cook, said by telephone from his Glenbrook, Nev., home. “He's a gypsy for the minute, but I imagine he'll phone me soon.”

Cook represented Kapp in the quarter back's reported demand for a $1.25‐million contract—a $250,000 annual salary for five years. Perhaps significantly, Kapp had sought out Cook a few years ago after the now retired 71‐year‐old San Francisco law yer had handled the reported $1‐million settlement for John Brodie, the 49er quar terback, during the merger confusion. When the American Football League was attempting to pirate several National Foot ball League quarterbacks, the Houston Oilers promised Brodie a $1‐million deal. After the merger was completed, the 49ers and the 25 other teams agreed to fulfill the promise to John Elliott Cook's client.
