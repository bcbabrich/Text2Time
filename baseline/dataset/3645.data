The investment, which would make Travelers the biggest shareholder in Nikko, shows how quickly national borders are breaking down in financial markets: even Japan, historically a protected market dominated almost exclusively by local brokerage firms, is now eager to embrace Wall Street investment and management.

Under the agreement, Nikko would join with Salomon's Japanese business to create Nikko Salomon Smith Barney Ltd., a joint venture, into which Nikko would put its capital markets and international businesses. The new joint venture company's chief executive would be Toshiharu Kojima, the head of Salomon's business in Japan, and it would be 51 percent owned by Nikko and 49 percent by Salomon, with each firm contributing six board members, according to the executives involved in the negotiations.

But Travelers through its investment in Nikko would be the more powerful partner. It would, under the accord to be announced today, buy 9.5 percent of Nikko's common stock, which has a current market value of about $540 million, and would also buy Nikko bonds that would be convertible into a further interest of about 15 percent of the brokerage firm, to give it about a 25 percent stake in the firm. Nikko is also expected to buy Travelers' shares in the open market to strengthen the link between the two companies.

Both companies declined to make any comment on their pending alliance over the weekend.

The Nikko investment carries big risks for Travelers, but also holds out the prospect of huge rewards if the joint venture works well and Travelers becomes the first American financial company to get extensive access to Japanese investors, who are currently estimated to have about $10 trillion of investments -- mostly invested in bank and savings deposits that yield less than 1 percent a year. Others are racing to try to reach the same goal in other ways; earlier this year, Merrill Lynch & Company bought some of the branches of the recently defunct Yamaichi Securities, and hired many of its former executives.

The Travelers' move, which is much larger than the Merrill Lynch investment, also comes soon after the big Japanese brokerage firms -- Nomura, Daiwa and Nikko -- have been found guilty of, and sanctioned for, paying bribes to sokaiya, as Japan's racketeers are known.
