King Fahd of Saudi Arabia wound up a visit to Egypt today by saying he would support Egypt's return to the Arab League. Cairo was expelled 10 years ago for making peace with Israel.

On the eve of the departure to Washington of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt for talks on Monday with President Bush, Mr. Mubarak has won the backing of the Saudis, the Jordanians and Palestine Liberation Organization, all of whom agree with the need to urge Washington to back an international peace conference on the Middle East.

After several days of talks with Mr. Mubarak, King Fahd's widely forecast endorsement of Egypt's return to the official Arab fold was interpreted here as an acknowledgment of Egypt's revived role in the Arab world after 10 years of ostracism because of its peace with Israel.

''The Saudi side said that Egypt's presence within the Arab fold was indispensable support for joint, concrete Arab work which would strengthen Arab solidarity in achieving the rights of the Arab nation,'' a joint Saudi-Egyptian statement said today, according to reports monitored here.
