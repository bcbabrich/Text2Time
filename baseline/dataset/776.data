EBERSTADT--Walter A. Lazard mourns the passing of Walter Eberstadt, our partner and cherished friend for four decades. He was one of our best: worldly, erudite, accomplished, and fully dedicated to his clients. He bridged cultures in international finance and enriched the lives of those he touched. He lived a remarkable life: born in Germany; fighting for the British in World War II; and moving to the U.S. where he would pioneer the field of international investing, while cultivating deep and broad passions for history, the arts, and global affairs. In retirement he remained a vibrant presence at Lazard and in society, serving not-for-profit organizations in the arts, education and public policy. We extend our deepest condolences to his wife, Vera, and his sons, George and Michael.
