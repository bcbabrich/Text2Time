Mike Huckabee, the governor of Arkansas, was sued by his daughter the other day. She said the state was trying to deny her the right to vote.

Mr. Huckabee does not lack for family troubles. His wife's floundering candidacy for secretary of state has hurt his re-election campaign. But the lawsuit did not bother him, his daughter, Sarah Huckabee, said.

''It was a little ironic,'' Ms. Huckabee said, ''but at the same time he said from the very start that this was one lawsuit he wanted to lose.''

In fact, when Mr. Huckabee heard that a state court judge in Arkadelphia had ordered that several hundred students from two colleges there be stricken from the voting rolls on residency grounds, he called the American Civil Liberties Union to suggest that his daughter might participate in a federal lawsuit. She joined four other plaintiffs.
