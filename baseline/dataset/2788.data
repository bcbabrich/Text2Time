An informant told the police that a missing Baylor basketball player was killed by his roommate and former teammate, according to a court document released here today.

The document, an affidavit for a search warrant, says the informant reported that the Baylor player, Patrick Dennehy, was shot in the head with a 9-millimeter pistol by Carlton Dotson after the two argued while shooting guns in the Waco area. The affidavit says that Dennehy pointed his gun at Dotson as if to shoot him and that Dotson responded by shooting Dennehy in the head.

No charges have been filed against Dotson, and Dennehy's body has not been found.

''They were the best of friends,'' said LaDonna Newton, a senior at Baylor who lived one floor below them at the Sterling Apartment complex. ''They were inseparable. I never saw them around anyone else but each other. I really don't see how an altercation could have gotten that far out of control.''

She said the last time she saw Dotson was when he came by her apartment a few weeks ago to play the board game Life.
