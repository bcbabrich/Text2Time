Detective Jennings's arm was in such pain this week from the shot that she could barely lift it. Her boss insisted she see a doctor, but her thoughts were on her fiancé, Robert Bolin, also a detective, who will remain behind, watching after their house and caring for their rabbit, three dogs and three cats. With war looming, their wedding has been indefinitely postponed.

''A sailor asked me, 'How do you feel knowing that you would live but your fiancé would die?' '' Detective Jennings, 32, said of a possible anthrax attack on the United States. ''That is devastating to think about. The realization of going to war is slapping people on the side of the head.''

In Goodland, Kan., residents lost their only Spanish-speaking doctor -- and the town's sole woman practitioner -- when Dr. Natalie Griego was activated by the Army National Guard. In addition to saying goodbye to her husband and her 22-month-old son, Dr. Griego left behind hundreds of distraught patients, including many expectant mothers.

She saw about 25 patients daily at Rural Health Ventures, the clinic where she worked with two other physicians, and she also saw patients in a hospital, a nursing home and a facility for the mentally handicapped. Shawna Blanka, 32, of St. Francis, Kan., had been driving 45 miles for her prenatal care. Mrs. Blanka is eight months pregnant.

''When I first found out she was leaving, I just wanted to cry, to be honest,'' Mrs. Blanka said. ''I've been a little stressed over it, and this is not a good time to be stressed either.''

Dr. Griego was given only 24 hours' notice to report for duty, yet more than 200 people gathered in Goodland for a farewell party. ''For the last two days, I couldn't talk without crying,'' Dr. Griego, 37, who is a captain in a medical battalion, said at a deployment ceremony in Montrose, Colo. ''I feel proud to be serving my country, but that doesn't make it any easier.''

Here in Albuquerque, the loss of deputies is so worrying to Sheriff White that he has asked the New Mexico Legislature to add an emergency ''wartime clause'' to the state's retirement law so that he can fill the gaps on his staff with retired police officers. Right now, retired law enforcement employees lose their pension benefits if they make more than $15,000 in a year.
