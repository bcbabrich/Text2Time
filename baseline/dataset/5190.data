It is fitting that, on the way to his shipboard summit meeting with George Bush, Mikhail Gorbachev is stopping today at Vatican City for an audience with the Pope. More than any American President or Western leader, John Paul II has played a crucial role in the historic liberalization of the Communist world.

It was Solidarity, after all, that first broke the grip of Communist totalitarianism, and Lech Walesa himself has described this Pope's galvinizing effect on his movement. If Mr. Walesa is the father of the breakup of monolithic Communism, the Pope is its spiritual godfather. Thus, there is poignancy for Roman Catholics in knowing that the man who helped open the way to democracy in the East is also the man who slammed shut the window of renewal that Pope John XXIII opened in 1962.

For many Catholics, the effect of John Paul II's papacy has been profoundly - and often literally - demoralizing. Should the Communist rulers of Rumania ever be deposed, the Pope may be left as the last absolute authority in Europe.

But as we listened to Mr. Gorbachev's astounding affirmation of religious values yesterday in Rome, we remembered that it was his visits both to Beijing and to East Berlin that seemed to spark an outpouring of democratic sentiment. Perhaps the world's top Communist can give the head of the Catholic Church some advice today on letting go outmoded controls to save what is essential to an organization and to a creed.
