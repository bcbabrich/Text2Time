NOT everyone is a born gardener, but some of us pretend. So I visited the hardware store to select seeds for my suburban garden and, after consulting the almanac on a shelf for information, chose peepers, tulips and helicopters. Taking the envelopes to the garden, I planted and watered the seeds and sped up the calendar so that each day took 10 seconds to pass. For this was a computer game, or simulation, Forever Growing Garden, by Media Vision of Fremont, Calif.

The cat watched from inside the house through a window, and soon a bluebird flew over to taunt it. A gopher also surfaced, but when I tried to catch him I caught a skunk instead. Finally, two beautiful peepers started to pop through, but as of this moment (it is Aug. 2; whoops, now it's Aug. 3) there is no sign of the tulips or helicopters, the latter being fantasy plants.

The program offers three settings: the suburban flower garden, a vegetable patch or the grounds of a medieval castle. Depending on the choice, the hardware store will offer appropriate seeds. After, or if, you have successfully grown the flowers or vegetables, you will be able to harvest the vegetables and take them to market to sell, cut the flowers and arrange them in a vase, or trim the castle's hedges into Scissorshands patterns. Gardens can be saved on disk and reopened later, and there are surprises hidden here and there.

Forever Growing Garden comes as a CD-ROM. The one disk works with PC's running Windows 3.1 or most Macintoshes running System 7.0 or later. The suggested list price is $39.95.
