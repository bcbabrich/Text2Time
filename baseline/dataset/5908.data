The easternmost part, which had been known as the East Riding of Yorkshire, was changed to Suffolk County, after Britain's easternmost county. To commemorate the occasion, the county is sponsoring a concert Sunday on the grounds of the Suffolk County Airport at Westhampton Beach. Starting at 8 P.M., the Long Island Philharmonic will perform a program that includes a world premiere - ''Honor Song,'' an overture by the composer David Amram. It was commissioned to mark the county's tricentennial and mixes ethnic melodies with themes that might have been familiar to the Indians who controlled Long Island before white settlers arrived. Also on the program Sunday are Stravinsky's ''Firebird'' Suite and Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 5. Conducting will be the orchestra's music director, Christopher Keene. The concert is free, and the public is invited to bring lawn chairs or blankets to sit on. In case of rain, the concert will be in Hauppauge High School, where seating is limited, so concertgoers are advised to arrive early. The music will be repeated on Monday at 8:30 P.M. at Heckscher Park in Huntington.

Tricentennial or not, it wouldn't be the Fourth without fireworks, and following Sunday's concert the sky will shimmer with a display by the Grucci family, whose fireworks have lighted the skies over New York Harbor in past years. It is scheduled to begin at 10 P.M. Fireworks are aso scheduled for 9:30 P.M. at Long Beach, where the best place to see them is on the Boardwalk between Edwards Boulevard and Riverside Boulevard.

Monday will bring any number of ways to enjoy the Fourth. The Nassau County Center for the Fine Arts in Roslyn Harbor is planning an ''old-fashioned American Fourth of July'' with a kite-making and kite-flying festival from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. To get spirits soaring, there will be music by the Dixie Ramblers, the Country Squires and the All-Americans. The best way to the center by car is to take Exit 39 north from the Long Island Expressway, turning left at Northern Boulevard and then watching for signs to the center.

There will be other kinds of old-fashioned doings at the Old Bethpage Village Restoration, Nassau County's working Colonial-style farm. From 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., there will be a celebration such as might have taken place in the mid-19th century. From the time the gates open until 1 P.M., costumed fiddlers will play serenades behind the Noon Inn. A picnic is scheduled from 12:30 until 2, and militia drills begin at 1. Then, at 2, the annual Fourth of July parade will move through the village, and at 3 a brass-band concert is scheduled. The Village Restoration is on Round Swamp Road, off Exit 48 of the Long Island Expressway. Admission is $3; $2.50 for Nassau residents, and $1.50 for children. The village, normally closed on Mondays, will take Tuesday off instead this week.

For a more modern Fourth, Eisenhower Park in East Meadow is offering a flag-raising ceremony at 9 A.M. on Monday, followed by a ''family fun'' run of 5 kilometers (3.12 miles), a strolling oom-pah band, children's games and performances of ''Aquarius'' by the Nassau County Puppet Theater at 1:30 and 3 P.M. The action shifts at 5 P.M. to Harry Chapin Lakeside Theater, where mimes and clowns will appear and where there will be a concert of patriotic and Broadway tunes by the Seuffert Band. There is no admission charge. Eisenhower Park is reached by taking the Meadowbrook Parkway to the park exit.

East Meadow is not the only place where people will be on the run this weekend. On Sunday in Lake Ronkonkoma, there will be a five-mile ''fun run'' starting at 8 A.M. at the Plaza 9 Shopping Center on Hawkins Avenue. There is a $6 entry fee, and would-be competitors should call (516) 588-2099. And in Port Washington, a coed volleyball tournament is scheduled to begin at 1 P.M. on Monday at Hempstead Harbor Beach Park. The number for details is (516) 883-2215. Tennis, everyone? In East Rockaway, the competition will be intense tomorrow, when a monthlong tournament begins. The men's doubles, boy's singles and women's doubles are scheduled at Bay Park on First Avenue, from 9 A.M. to 11 P.M.. The number for details is (516) 593-5855.
