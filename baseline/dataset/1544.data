BAGHDAD — It was April 2003, and American tanks had just punched through into Baghdad. A safe distance behind came the first post-invasion American bureaucracy, the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA).

ORHA is a name long since forgotten by most Iraqis — if indeed they ever knew it. And many would scorn the statement of purpose set out in its name. Amid widespread anger, the single most crucial ingredient in the country’s reconstruction — electrical power to run its farms, factories, other businesses and construction projects — continues to lag far behind the country’s needs.



For much of the past seven years, Iraqis have railed constantly about two words: “kahraba” (electricity) and “amn” (security).

The security has improved, markedly, although to levels that many of those who proclaim this war over would consider murderously dangerous in their own countries.

Electrical generation has also increased, as Steven Lee Myers writes. But demand has increased far more, leaving Iraqis prey to continuing daily power blackouts, as they head into another 120 degree summer, and one that coincides with the holy month of Ramadan, with its required daytime fasts.

Electricity — or the lack thereof — remains more than a complaint. It has become a central benchmark by which Iraqis judge the post-war order. And, almost universally, they judge it to have failed in this regard.

Two phrases heard on the streets are repeated so often they have become conventional wisdom, even mantras: The country that could put a man on the moon can’t fix another country’s electricity? The superpower that got Kuwait’s electricity running within months in the early 1990s couldn’t do the same in Iraq a decade later?

But increasingly the blame has shifted from the Americans to successive Iraqi governments. Some Iraqis single out their country’s current political power vacuum. Five months since parliamentary elections in March, the competing political parties are still unable to agree on a new government, or even on a prime minister.

On a pilgrimage to the Kadhimiya district of Baghdad in July — a pilgrimage on which at least 28 Shiite worshipers were killed by a suicide bomber — Iraqis paused on their way to the shrine of Imam Musa al-Kadhim to talk to The New York Times about the electricity situation in their areas.

Some were from Baghdad, others from the mainly Shiite cities and provinces to the south of the capital.

“Right now, the electricity is better than before, when the peaceful demonstrations took place a month ago.

“Before, we used to get one hour of electricity every six hours; now we get two hours of electricity every six hours. But it is for sure not satisfying.

“As long as we are under occupation, we are not going to be satisfied. What will satisfy us is to live like every other country. We are aiming for a better future.

“When we look at Africa, or South Africa, we see that they are simple people compared to us, while we are a rich country only in appearance, not in substance.

“Electricity represents our economic situation in general. Our economy is on hold right now, and that serves the interests of the neighboring countries.

“I blame the neighboring countries, because they are benefiting from our current situation. Iran and Saudi Arabia. And even Turkey, that is causing a water crisis.”

“The electricity situation in Amara is not good. Every five hours, we have one hour electricity, but it is not constant,” he said.

“This is all the responsibility of the government. Had there been order, we would have had good electricity.

“The failure of the government made the people victims. If the head of a house is fighting with the members of his family, how can he raise a good generation? It won’t work.

“The only solution is a strong, firm and just government. As long as we have a strong government and strong security, the neighbors do not matter. The government failed, 100 percent. It is weak because there are many parties that are not able to reach an understanding between each other.”

“There are occasions when there is no electricity. Our government is not fair. We are not benefiting from this government.

“I am a widow, and we used to get a salary every three months. It has been seven months, and I haven’t got a salary yet.

Abdul Kadhim Jaber, from Karbala, said: “The electricity is not good; there are no services. No electricity, no water.”

However, overhearing him, Abdul Mahdi, also from Karbala, disagreed strongly.

“The electricity has improved. It is not like it was before,” he said.

“We used to have four hours of electricity, and it was off for two hours, but not constant. With the generators that we have, we can manage fine.”

Ali Kreidi of Diwaniya came to Baghdad at the same time as the pilgrimage, but not for religious reasons. He traveled north from Diwaniya to buy an industrial-size electricity generator.

“We don’t have electricity continuously. There has been no improvement; on the contrary, it has got worse. We used to have two hours on and two hours off. Now it is four hours off,” he said.

“We do not know what the reasons are. It is very hot, and the temperature sometimes reaches 55 and 60 degrees ( 130 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit).

The New York Times

“I am, for example, the owner of a company that imports food and milk products, and my products often go bad. The generator will cost me $4,500.

“This is the third generator that I have bought, and it is not even strong enough.”

He said he could run all his generators at full capacity because they would break down. So he runs them at only half capacity. “Even so, after one month, the generator breaks down. So I have to sell it and buy a new one.”
