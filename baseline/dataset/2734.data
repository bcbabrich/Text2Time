Of course, she was right. And the unshakable nature of her belief was the clincher.

Certainly none of her ideas were bizarre or impossible. People are harassed and envied all the time. But her absolute absence of doubt was what made her psychotic. She could not imagine being wrong.

Probably no psychiatric term is bandied about as loosely as paranoia. But paranoia covers a broad terrain, from a stable personality trait to a symptom of severe mental illness.

Paranoia may even confer an adaptive advantage in some instances. After all, someone who is always watching his back and is mindful that his peers are driven by self-interest is more likely to have a competitive edge when one is needed.

In politics, mild paranoia is probably an asset; no politician could survive for long with a rosy and trusting view of the world.

But there is a world of difference between having a paranoid streak and harboring a delusion.

Some people, like my patient, develop a delusional disorder in middle or late life, having had no trace of paranoid thinking before. Their disorder is fairly rare but striking. These patients falsely believe that they are the objects of persecution, envy or even love. Yet they often function effectively at work and can superficially pass for normal in social settings.
