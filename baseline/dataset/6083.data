VLADIMIR SPIVAKOV, the Soviet violinist, enlivened the Mostly Mozart concert at Avery Fisher Hall on Monday night with a vivid and beautifullyplayed interpretation of Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 5 in A (K. 219).

Performing with the Festival Orchestra conducted by Sergiu Comissiona, Mr. Spivaltov projected the melodic ebullience of this well‐known concerto with verve and authority that remained constant throughout the work. He was not solemn with this music, not timid about underscoring the contrasts of mood and manner that lie within it. Rather, there was an exuberance about it that told of youthful delight in unfettered melody and uncomplicated virtuosity.

Mr. Spivakov was not the only soloist of the evening. Misha Dichter was on hand to play Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23 in A (K. 488). He took what might be described as the careful .approach, working extra hard to play oh‐so‐gently on a mighty 20th‐century nine‐foot concert grand piano.

Since in all its years of existence, the Mostly Mozart Festival has done nothing to clarify stylistic confusions that surround the Mostly Mozart repertory, Mr. Dichter is hardly to be chided for the giant‐instrument, dwarf‐sound incongruities. He is, after all, a sensitive and conscientious young artist, and if neither his conservatory training nor professional experience has provicde ed answers for substantial stylistic dilemmas, it is hardly his fault
