"Malice" could turn out to be the new season's pop mystery-suspense melodrama you won't want to miss. The film is deviously entertaining from its start through its finish, when most such movies go as irretrievably to pieces as Margo's face at the end of "Lost Horizon." "Malice" stays the course. If it were a car, it could be called a mean machine. Though light of weight, it hugs the road around every hairpin curve in its cruel and twisty narrative.

Cruel?

As written by Aaron Sorkin ("A Few Good Men") and Scott Frank, and directed by Harold Becker ("Sea of Love"), the movie opens on a gorgeous autumn afternoon with a montage of shots of an idyllic New England town that is the seat of a women's college rather like Smith. A pretty student bicycles home after classes, looking so pure and clean that it's axiomatic that something unspeakably dirty is about to happen to her. Two minutes later, as her cat watches nonjudgmentally from under a chair, she is brutally attacked by an unseen intruder and left for dead.

Cut to the operating room in the local hospital sometime later: Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin), a hotshot brain surgeon, is working to save the young woman's life. While doing incredibly adept things with scalpels, clamps and suction pumps, he's also insulting his O.R. associates with his sarcastic, supremely arrogant put-downs and asides. Jed is more than self-assured; he's high on the fun of the bloody business at hand. The thought arises that he might be the person who is raping and killing pretty young college students with alarming regularity.

In this way begins a convoluted tale of murder, lust, greed and mendacity. In addition to the charmingly vain and therefore suspicious brain surgeon, the principal characters are Andy Safian (Bill Pullman), the mild-mannered but seemingly staunch dean of the women's college, and his adoring wife, Tracy (Nicole Kidman), who works in a day-care center and wants nothing more than to have her own children.
