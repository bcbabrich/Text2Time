I thoroughly enjoyed your article, with one exception -- the family portrait of John Eberhardt and his "adopted son and lover." My attitude has always been live and let live, but the words "adopted son and lover" denote an unhealthy relationship -- dare I say incest? This same situation is what many found appalling about Woody Allen's affair and his attitude that nothing was wrong with it. CAROL M. URQUHART Smithtown, L.I.
