Betsy King birdied her final hole today to retain a one-stroke lead over Tammie Green after the second round of the $600,000 du Maurier Classic, the richest tournament on the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour.

King, 33 years old, has won four tournaments and leads the L.P.G.A. this season with earnings of $365,986. King and Green each shot three-under-par 69 on the 6,261-yard par-72 Beaconsfield Golf Club course.

King was at eight-under 136 after 36 holes in the second of the four major tournaments on the women's tour.

Deb Richard followed an opening-round 69 with a 70 and was tied for third with Nancy Lopez, who had the best round of the day, a 67.
