WHO has the top Top 10 list?

On this side of the field is Lehman Brothers. Every July since 1949, Lehman has offered up a list of 10 best stocks for the next 12 months. But last year Shearson Lehman split up, and while Lehman retained rights to the list -- Ten Uncommon Values -- Smith Barney, which got Shearson, felt heir to the tradition, too. So in July it suited up a rival portfolio -- Ten Exceptional Names -- and yesterday ended the new contest's first quarter.

The results, dividends and commissions excluded: Lehman Uncommons over the Smith Barney Exceptionals, 14.1 percent to 13.5 percent.

But both teams strongly outpaced the S.& P. 500, up just 4.15 percent. The disparity is not unusual. Many brokerage firms have best-buy lists, and they often outdo the market, said Rick Chrabaszewski of Zacks Investment Research. In 1990, these lists' 7.25 percent loss trailed the S.& P. 500's loss of 3.1 percent, for instance, but their total returns of 50 percent in 1991, 20.24 percent in 1992 and 19.6 in 1993 consistently outdid the 500's respective returns of 30.5 percent, 7.6 percent and 10.1 percent.

And the two Top 10 lists, smaller than most best-buy rosters, are among the pickiest of picks. Lehman's 10 Uncommons are culled from 300 buy recommendations, which are themselves drawn from the 1,000 stocks Lehman follows. Smith Barney's Exceptionals come from the 180 high-rated buys among the 1,200 securities it tracks.
