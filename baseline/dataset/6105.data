Three Episcopal churches addressed themselves in different ways yesterday to the rising dissension in their denomination, stemming largely from its willingness to ordain women. In West Palm Beach, Fla., a congregation refused to bear Bishop James Duncan, above, beam it voted overwhelmingly to secede from the church. In Plainfield, N.J., the priest of secessionist St. Stephen's Church, forbidden in officiate by court order, stood by the altar while another priest prayed that diocesan bishops might “come to their senses” about women's ordination. And in Manhattan, the Church of the Ascension celebrated its 150th anniversary with a tacit affirmation that for the future, as Donald R. Goodness, the rector, said, “If the church is here, it will be part of the Episcopal Church.” Articles on the three parishes appear on Page 61.
