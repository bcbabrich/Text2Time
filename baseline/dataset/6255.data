CAIRO, Oct. 2—The Arab commando raid that impelled the Austrian Government to announce a suspension of special transit arrangements for groups of Soviet Jews going to Israel has won the official approval of the Egyptian Government.

Egypt had previously voiced disapproval of such commando attacks as airliner hijackings for instance. But in this case the issue of emigration to Israel from the Soviet Union is involved, and so Cairo is making a basic distinction between the kidnapping of four hostages from a Moscow‐to‐Vienna train last Friday and all previous commando attacks in foreign countries.

The Egyptian press, after a two‐day silence, is now hailing the commando operation and praising Chancellor Brund Kreisky of Austria for deciding to close the special transit facilities in exchange for the lives of the four hostages.

Egypt's President, Anwar elSadat, is sending a persona envoy, Minister of Tourism Ismall Fahmy, to Vienna tomorrow with a message of thanks to the Austrian leader.
