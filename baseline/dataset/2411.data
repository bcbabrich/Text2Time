France has agreed to present Libya with a plan to develop a civilian nuclear energy program, the French Foreign Ministry said. A ministry spokesman, Jean-Baptiste Mattei, was quoted by Reuters as saying that for development of peaceful nuclear energy, "the details are still being worked out, so we are still in an exploratory stage." In 2003, Libya pledged to give up nuclear weapons and agreed to dismantle installations that could be used for such weapons. John Tagliabue (NYT)
