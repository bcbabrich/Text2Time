At another crowded job fair at the Marriott Hotel in Brooklyn on Wednesday, many applicants said they were frustrated that they would not be able to work in districts that were close to home or to their graduate schools. Many districts in Queens and Manhattan have only a few vacancies in troubled schools, so most teachers who had their hearts set on working in those boroughs were disappointed. A few teachers at the job fair were in tears.

But others were glad to be assigned to a challenging school, saying they had gone into the profession to work with children who needed the most help.

''I really want to teach disadvantaged kids,'' said Waithira Mbuthia-Protano of Mamaroneck, N.Y., who accepted a job teaching English at Alfred E. Smith High School in the Bronx, a failing school. ''I want to give, I want to sweat, I want to give all my energy to help.''

To lure certified teachers into the failing schools, the Board of Education is offering teachers $3,400 in tuition reimbursement over the next four years. The failing schools also have smaller classes, and teachers get extra help from curriculum specialists. This summer, the board recruited about 330 people with little or no teaching experience to work in the failing schools under an alternative certification program. The board has also held several job fairs for the failing schools since Aug. 1, when Mr. Mills, unsatisfied by the city's pace in hiring certified teachers for those schools, filed his lawsuit.

In an interview yesterday, Mr. Mills said certified teachers who did not want to set foot inside the failing schools should reconsider, because the students at those schools badly needed qualified teachers.

''People are going to have to be guided by their better angels,'' he said.

He added, ''This court action has led to profound change in the way the city places teachers, and it's high time.'' The failing schools ''were always last in line, and now they are first in line.''

But the other parties to the settlement that resulted in the court order were still unhappy with its terms. Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy said any teacher who agreed to work in an urban school was taking on a major challenge. ''People who choose urban education are doing God's work,'' he said, ''and where they choose to teach and how they choose to dedicate themselves is a matter of personal reflection.''
