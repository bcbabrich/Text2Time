About 70 percent of Republicans who were elected to office with a 10-point margin of victory or less voted in favor of the bill.

Two-thirds of Republicans elected to Congress for the first time in 2010 voted yes, though some said the final deal did not go far enough.

Mr. Boehner lost support among the 38 Republicans who signed the “Cut, Cap and Balance” pledge. The bill requires Congress to vote on a balanced budget amendment, but does not require passage of it.

The bill received favorable votes from many, but not all, members of the Tea Party faction, many of whom pushed for a balanced budget amendment.
