Mr. Stern, who has just set up a good-government group called New York Civic, sent an e-mail message on Wednesday about a tree that was destroyed in Riverdale. But that message was not the only one that reached the people on his address list. They also began receiving copies of mail addressed to him by people who wanted their names taken off his list.

For example, ROBERT REID, the chief of the coastal ecology branch of the National Marine Fisheries Service, said not only that he wanted to be dropped from the list, but that Mr. Stern had not given him the park name he had requested.

''I wanted to be 'Homo sapiens,' so I could have dominion over all the other animals,'' Mr. Reid wrote. But Mr. Stern christened him ''Sapient.''

Gorilla weighed in with an e-mail message to Mr. Reid and two others who wanted to be taken off Mr. Stern's list. Apparently unaware that their messages had reached him unintentionally, Mr. Harding asked that they not share future requests ''with all the animals and flora in the Parks jungle and our overburdened computers.'' Mr. Harding did not return a call for comment.

Too Good to Be False

The cover of the March issue of Jane magazine promises ''stuff we couldn't make up if we tried.'' Not mentioned is something that falls into that category but did not happen until after the magazine went to press: The engagement of the editor in chief, JANE PRATT. ANDREW SHAIFER, an actor who has had small parts in such films as ''Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo,'' proposed during a dinner party given by the actress ELIZABETH PERKINS. The couple met at a dinner party she gave last year. This time, the guests included KEVIN SPACEY, BONO, COURTNEY COX ARQUETTE and DAVID ARQUETTE. Ms. Pratt declined to talk about the engagement, saying through a spokeswoman that she was superstitious about discussing ''big things,'' which until now had mostly meant what was going to appear on the next month's cover.
