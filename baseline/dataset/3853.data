For 56 years, Eddie Robinson has been the football coach at Grambling State University in Louisiana, and his 405 victories are the most of any college coach in history. Yesterday, the National Collegiate Athletic Association placed Grambling on two years' probation for violations by Robinson, his son Eddie Robinson Jr. and other coaches at the college.

The N.C.A.A. cited infractions in football, men's basketball and women's basketball. They included illegal recruiting, out-of-season practices, the use of academically ineligible players and a lack of institutional control.

Among the football violations were impermissible tryouts and improper talks with prospective transfer athletes. In men's basketball, a player was allowed to play in five games in 1993 even though he did not complete 24 credit hours the previous year, as N.C.A.A. rules require. In women's basketball, a player was allowed to practice and receive scholarship money during the 1993-94 and 1995-96 seasons even though her American College Testing scores had been invalidated.

When the N.C.A.A. notified Grambling of the infractions, the college started an investigation. In a 254-page response to the N.C.A.A., the college denied many of the charges. Still, the N.C.A.A. called the violations ''major.'' Grambling assessed some penalties on itself. The major penalties came from the N.C.A.A.'s Committee on Infractions.
