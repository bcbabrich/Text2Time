If you’re hoping to run the New York City Marathon, today is your last chance to enter the lottery.

Anyone with a U.S. address who will be 18 or older on Sunday, November 1, 2009, may apply for entry until 11:59 p.m. on June 1, 2009. (The deadline for international entries has already passed.)

The New York Road Runners will hold the drawing on Wednesday, so people should be able to check their status online on Thursday. They will also be notified via e-mail on Thursday.

New York Times writer Liz Robbins, author of “A Race Like No Other: 26.2 Miles Through the Streets of New York” (Harper), warns that it takes a lot of luck to win a lottery slot. In 2008, nearly 57,000 people entered the lottery, but only 5,600 were accepted.

“I always joke that it’s easier to get into Harvard than the New York City Marathon,” she says.

But it’s worth a try. If you don’t make it, check back with the Run Well series later this week and we’ll explore the various charity options that guarantee willing fundraisers a spot in the marathon. We’ll also take a look at other local, national and international marathon options for the lottery rejects.
