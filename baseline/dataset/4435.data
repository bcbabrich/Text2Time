The Rangers have struggled through more than two months without top defenseman Brian Leetch, who is recovering from damage to nerves in his neck and left shoulder. Jan Erixon, Darren Turcotte, James Patrick, Jay Wells, Mike Hurlbut, Sergei Zubov and Kevin Lowe are sidelined by or struggling with injuries, and Phil Bourque and Randy Gilhen returned to action on this trip after missing two weeks apiece with sore knees.

Doctors here originally feared that one of Messier's ribs had punctured one of his lungs, which would have kept him out of the lineup for at least six weeks. But the possibility that one of his ribs was broken was ruled out after he underwent X-rays and an examination at an Edmonton hospital Saturday night. According to Messier, doctors suspected that one of his right ribs popped out of place and then reset itself.

Messier planned to be reexamined by a member of the Rangers' medical staff in New York by Monday morning at the latest. An updated report on his condition is not likely to be available until Monday afternoon. He has been playing with back problems all season and missed six games immediately before the All-Star Game break with a fractured wrist.

"How long has it been since the whole team's been together -- three months now?" Messier said. "It's pretty disappointing, but it's amazing to see the guys pulling together the way we have. I think it shows the kind of character and commitment this team has. Injuries can't seem to stop us."

Messier's situation put a damper on what was an otherwise heartening Rangers trip. In five games, the team picked up 7 of 10 possible points and almost had five victories; one game slipped away late in the final period and the other ended in a tie. On Saturday night, the Rangers were forced to abandon their attacking style in the absence of the injured defensemen Zubov and Patrick, their top offense-minded blueliners besides Leetch. But they still managed to hold off Edmonton.
