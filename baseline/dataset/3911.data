IT'S time again to ask 20 questions about advertising, marketing and the media.

*As the McDonald's Corporation battles consumer perceptions that competitors sell better-tasting, higher-quality fast food, is it a good idea to run a television commercial in which a man ordering at a McDonald's, after being asked by an employee what he wants to eat, replies, ''I don't care, just 'Supersize' me''?

*How many grammarians wrote to the Newspaper Association of America to complain that a recent ad about a campaign ''to promote literacy'' also invites readers to visit the association ''at their Web site''?

*If the Bates Worldwide unit of Cordiant P.L.C. proceeds with plans to call its new headquarters in midtown Manhattan the Bates Worldwide Building, will the lobby be filled with tall young men who run motels, dress like their mothers and wield knives in the shower?

*Is the marketing maven who renamed used cars ''pre-owned'' responsible for deciding that used video games may sell better if they are pitched as ''preplayed''?
