WASHINGTON, Jan. 2 (AP) —The International Monetary Fund said today it had com pleted the first distribution of the new money substitute known as “paper gold.”

The I.M.F. said it had allo cated $3.4‐billion of its new special drawing rights, S.D.R.'s, approved when the Fund's gov ernors met in Washington last fall, to 104 of the 115 member nations.

Paper gold is a new monetary reserve that will be used only among nations. Those that are participating agreed to accept the S.D.R.'s, just as they would accept genuine gold, in payment from countries with balance‐of payments deficits.

Fowler Among Leaders

Among the leading figures in the lengthy negotiations that brought the S.D.R. plan to frui tion were Henry H. Fowler and Frederick L. Deming of the United States, Karl Blessing and Otmar Emminger of West Germany, James Callaghan of Britain, Michel Debra of France, Emilio Colombo and Guido Carli of Italy and Pierre‐Paul Schweitzer, managing director of the International Monetary Fund.
