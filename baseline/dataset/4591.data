The words are about women, cars and dives; the music rarely uses more than three guitar chords. From those rock-and-roll fundamentals, Little Village concocts songs that can swagger and cackle and twang, twist a perfect bit of wordplay, then reveal unguarded longing and pain.

Little Village is the band that made John Hiatt's breakthrough album, "Bring the Family," with Ry Cooder on guitars, Nick Lowe on bass and Jim Keltner on drums abetting Hiatt's vocals. This time, the whole band collaborated on songwriting, making the songs slightly less private in tone and winding the rhythms a little tighter.

Unlike "Bring the Family," "Little Village" (Reprise 26713; cassette and CD) has the layered sound of a studio production, with backup vocal harmonies, added percussion and skillfully intertwined guitar parts. But the band still lobs easy syncopations across the beat. Cooder's sliding, hanging guitar lines and Keltner's relaxed thump and clatter find the nexus of blues, country and gospel, while Hiatt's voice bounds through the lyrics like a cartoon hound dog.

Little Village finds new ways to connect cars and sex in "She Runs Hot" and in "Solar Sex Panel," an ecologically correct come-on. It also comes up with wry and tender advice for a spurned lover: "Don't you think about her when you're trying to drive."
