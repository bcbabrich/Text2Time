To the Sports Editor:

I was shocked and surprised by "Steinbrenner Lashes Out at Lack of Fans in Stands," (The Times, Sept. 29). If Steinbrenner spent as much time trying to please fans as he does trying to get his name in the papers, there would be huge crowds at Yankee Stadium. Part of the problem is with Major League Baseball, which allows Steinbrenner (against its own rules) to be an absentee owner in Tampa, Fla. He's not a New Yorker. He can't even sit with fans in his home stadium because they would boo him out of his seat. If he wants to go to New Jersey, fine. Just leave the Yankees behind. BILL WOLFSTHAL New York
