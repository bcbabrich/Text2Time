The simpler service, and the one most devoted to its task, is ShareALot. When the program is running, a yellow folder icon sits on your Windows or Mac OS X desktop. To share some photos, you just drag them onto that folder. From a pop-up menu, choose Create a New Share. Your ShareALot address book appears, and you click on the names of the lucky recipients.

Now you name your shared batch of photos, type a little message (''Apart from the overturned spaghetti bowl, isn't she cute?'') and click on Finish.

The next time your mother spends at least a few minutes online, a Mac dialog box or Windows system-tray balloon will appear on her computer to announce the arrival of the new pictures. When she points to the yellow ShareALot folder icon on her screen and clicks Show Albums in the shortcut menu, your photos will open in her Web browser. (ShareALot simply uses the browser as a viewer. The photos aren't actually on the Web; they're dispatched from your hard drive to your mother's, for viewing even after she goes offline.)

Next and Previous buttons let your mother conduct her own little grandmotherly slide show of your baby shots. Short of hiring a professional mouse manipulator, it couldn't get much easier.

In the current, early release of the software, the Rename, Rotate and Order Prints buttons say ''coming soon.'' Already, though, your recipients can click on the ''Higher resolution available'' button. ShareALot sends an invisible message back to your computer requesting the transmission of your original jumbo high-resolution picture files, which your fans will need if they want to print out the photos. Otherwise, what they see on the screen are scaled-down, 640-by-480-pixel versions that transfer quickly and are ideally sized for display on the screen.

ShareALot is a treat to use, especially because it's simple, free and equally satisfying for Mac, Windows and (soon) Linux fans. The company indicates that the finished version of the service will offer premium features for a fee -- ordering prints, for example -- but that basic photo sharing features will remain free.

ShareALot's rival, OurPictures, is three pieces of software in one. It can take on any of three identities, depending on the technical expertise of the operator: Companion, Basic or Complete mode.
