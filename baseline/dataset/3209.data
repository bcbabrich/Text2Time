A security company that was cited for several security lapses at Logan International Airport after Sept. 11 will no longer screen passengers or baggage at the airport under an agreement reached today with the state.

The company, Argenbright Security Inc., agreed to the settlement after the state police, upset by the lapses, tried to revoke its license on Nov. 15.

The announcement came hours before a scheduled hearing on the Argenbright license issue before a state police board. Col. John DiFava of the state police, Logan's interim security director, said the compromise met his goal: cracking down on mistakes by airport screeners.

''It's not a question of trying to blow up Argenbright,'' Colonel DiFava said. ''It's a question of trying to get security at Logan. I was sensitive to the fact that they were fighting for their very survival.''
