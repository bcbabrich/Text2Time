The growth rate of the nation's economy slowed slightly in July, the National Association of Purchasing Management said in its monthly report, which is scheduled to be released today.

Growth in new orders remained healthy, expanding at its second-greatest seasonally adjusted rate since last October. The July growth was fueled by a torrid pace of export orders. However, the month's production rate was slightly below that of June, and vendor deliveries remained slow, but the rate of slowing abated somewhat.

Aided by summer jobs, the employment rate increased for the second consecutive month. Rises in inventories and prices were also reported.

The report is a result of a survey of managers at more than 250 companies in 21 industries. Economists consider its findings to be a preliminary indicator of the previous month's economic performance.
