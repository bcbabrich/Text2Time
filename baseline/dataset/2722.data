After weeks of opposition by state lawmakers and local officials, Gov. George E. Pataki today retreated from his proposal to bill local governments for half the costs of property tax breaks offered to businesses in state economic development zones.

Mr. Pataki, a Republican, made the proposal in his executive budget last month, saying that it would save the state about $4 million annually. Currently, the state pays $250 million every year to local governments to cover the cost of a variety of tax breaks in 72 specially designated Empire Zones across the state.

But the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, and the Senate Majority Leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican, opposed the change. This week, Mr. Bruno proposed expanding the program by adding 18 more zones, mostly in counties that have none.

Many state and local government officials also lobbied against Mr. Pataki's plan, saying it would not only cost local governments money but would also discourage them from participating in one of the state's most successful economic development programs.
