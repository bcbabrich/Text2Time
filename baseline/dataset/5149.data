George Bell drove in three runs, two with a home run that extended his hitting streak to a club-record 22 games, as the Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Chicago White Sox this afternoon, 5-1, to complete a sweep of a three-game series.

And when Baltimore lost to Cleveland, 11-0, later today, the Blue Jays moved into a tie for first place with the Orioles in the American League East. The victory was Toronto's ninth in 10 games.

Bell's hitting streak is the longest in the American League this season. The homer was his 16th of the season, and it brought the sellout crowd of 49,422 to its feet. The fans would not sit down until Bell obliged them with a curtain call.

Dave Stieb (14-8) was the winner. Tom Henke, who pitched the ninth, struck out one, giving him 40 strikeouts in his last 25Y innings. Steve Rosenberg (4-10) lost in his second complete game of the season.
