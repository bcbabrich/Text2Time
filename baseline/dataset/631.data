TUESDAY PUZZLE — Anyone hungry? Pull up a chair and tuck in, because Bruce Haight is catering today’s Wordplay gathering, which is darned nice of him, if you ask me.

We’ve got a PITCHER OF BEER, HERO SANDWICHes, and even a nontheme CHEESE PIZZA on which to nosh, and while we are snacking we can talk about his puzzle.

If you started in the northwest, you might have thought that the theme had something to do with the letter B, because there are quite a few of them there. When you move on, however, you’ll see that the long Across entries are three seemingly disparate entries plus the revealer at 57 Across. Those three theme entries are not as disparate as they seem at first: The word HERO is sandwiched inside each of them, hence the revealer HERO SANDWICH.

In nontheme news, I liked URBAN SPRAWL and CHEESE PIZZA.

Clue of the Day for me was “It’s right at 90 degrees” for ANGLE.

Let’s check in with Mr. Haight:

Constructor’s Notes:

First of all, I’d like to give a shout-out to the “fan club” that coalesced briefly to lambaste the fill on my “Eight Letter” puzzle of April 14, 2015. I affectionately refer to them as the … (drumroll) … H8ers (rimshot). Moving along quickly, I’ve often thought that hidden-word puzzles are a bit like “word sandwiches,” so this was my attempt to capitalize on that notion. HAM SANDWICH, with 11 letters, would have allowed another theme entry, but a three-letter word sandwich didn’t seem kosher to me. I wasn’t very optimistic about this puzzle, since BEACH EROSION seemed less than heroic and my submitted puzzle had an awful section of “dreck” fill in the middle. I actually had AEDES crossing AIDER — a really bad neighborhood. However, much to my surprise, the puzzle got the green light from Will on the first go-round. Later, I tried to talk Will into “THE OLD SWITCHEROO” as an additional 16-letter theme entry through the middle but he was not interested in that tricky little transformation. Also, I suggested adding blocks to the middle to improve the fill, but I found out Will had already had Frank Longo clean that up. He did it by moving two blocks instead of adding two blocks — much more elegant. Frank is an ace solver and does a lot of New York Times puzzle work behind the scenes. Thank you, Frank Longo (and Will and Joel), for making some of us constructors look smarter than we really are!

I have no concrete memory of this television show, but apparently there was a series called “Hot HERO SANDWICH,” which ran for the 1979-1980 season and was sort of a children’s version of the early “Saturday Night Live.” It was a variety show that featured music, celebrity interviews and comedy sketches for pre-teenagers and teenagers, but the innovative part of the show was having psychologist Dr. Tom Cottle discuss the issues of the late 1970s to the young television audience. Unfortunately, the show didn’t catch on and it was canceled after its first season. Let’s check out the opening of this groundbreaking show:
