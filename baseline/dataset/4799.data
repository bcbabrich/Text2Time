Go-Video Inc. said it would appeal a jury verdict rejecting its claim that three Japanese electronics companies conspired to prevent introduction of a dual-deck videocassette recorder in the mid-1980's. "I'll never give up," R. Terren Dunlap, Go-Video's chairman, said. A United States District Court jury found Thursday in favor of the defendants, the Sony Corporation, the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company and the Victor Company of Japan.

Go-Video filed an antitrust lawsuit in 1987 against more than 20 defendants, contending that they had conspired to block the manufacture and sale of the VCR-2 because they had not been able to put the device together themselves. Go-Video settled or gave up on all but the three defendants, receiving about $6.8 million in out-of-court settlements and an agreement with the Samsung Electronics Company of South Korea to manufacture the VCR-2.
