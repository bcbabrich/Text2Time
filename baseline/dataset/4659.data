AUTO RACING Pole for Mario Andretti

Mario Andretti outperformed his son Michael in a record-setting duel yesterday at Michigan International Speedway, taking the pole position for tomorrow's Marlboro 500 with a lap of 230.150 miles an hour. Michael was timed in 230.056 on the track, located in Brooklyn, Mich. The elder Andretti's fast lap gave him the 65th pole of his career -- extending his own series record -- but his first since Miami in 1987. It also made the 52-year-old Andretti the oldest man ever to win an Indy-car pole. The only official laps faster than the one by Andretti yesterday came in May during the Indianapolis 500 qualifying, when Roberto Guerrero had four laps faster than 232 miles an hour.

Gil Morgan, after a three-hour rain delay, used a 20-foot chip-in to resurrect his game and took the lead yesterday midway through the rain-shortened second round of the Canon Greater Hartford Open in Cromwell, Conn. Morgan was struggling but birdied two of his final four holes to move to six-under-par 64, 2-under for the day. Kenny Knox, the first-round leader, and Billy Ray Brown, the defending champion, were tied with Morgan at 6-under and will resume second-round play this morning. Knox had finished four holes and Brown six when play was suspended for good with 80 players still on the course. (AP)
