KEARNY, N.J., Sept. 30 - A ton of unstable granular acid used to clean swimming pools released a noxious cloud of gas on Friday morning, causing the authorities to shut down the Pulaski Skyway and briefly evacuate several businesses in the area.

The leak occurred around 8:30 a.m. in a processing area of Alden Leeds, a factory that manufactures chemicals used in swimming pools, the authorities said.

Hazardous materials teams responded to the leak, which was first reported to be pure chlorine, which can be fatal if inhaled.

The batch of trichloroisocyanuric acid, a chlorinating agent and disinfectant used in swimming pools, was being moved in a specially designed and strongly reinforced "super sack" to a processing area by forklift when the acid began to decompose, the company's vice president, Larry Epstein, said.
