Kline May Sign On as Papp Aide

Kevin Kline may soon be added to the list of directors whom Joseph Papp has hired to oversee programming at the Public Theater. Such a move, some staff members feel, could threaten the future of Mr. Papp's newly appointed artistic associate and apparent successor, JoAnne Akalaitis. Mr. Papp is having discussions with Mr. Kline to supervise the Shakespeare marathon, which began in January 1988 and which has so far included 15 of the 36 plays. Two of the more successful efforts have been Mr. Kline's "Hamlet," in which he starred and directed, and "The Taming of the Shrew," with Tracey Ullman and Morgan Freeman, directed by A. J. Antoon. Still, Mr. Papp acknowledges he has been "unhappy with some of the work we've done" in the marathon.

Staff members at the Public say he's also been uncertain about the long-term role of Ms. Akalaitis, who has had trouble fitting in with the Shakespeare Festival's entrenched permanent staff. "She is very insecure and difficult to deal with, and Joe hates insecurity more than anything," says one staff member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, adding that Ms. Akalaitis, who is directing "Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2" for a March 6 opening, might not welcome reporting to Mr. Kline.

Mr. Papp says: "Kevin Kline is one of our finest Shakespearean actors, but he hasn't said yes yet. JoAnne Akalaitis is the best director we have, and she will figure very prominently in the future of this institution." Mr. Papp says a lot also depends on Mr. Kline's film commitments. "We still need to formulate the relationships," he says. "Kevin might just direct, or just act. He might also be on our board of directors. I want to hug him tighter to this institution." Mr. Kline's agent, Jeff Hunter, says, "It would be premature to comment."

Mr. Papp says he would like to see Mr. Kline create a small company using the talents of younger people. "I used to say that all you needed to do Shakespeare was two planks and a passion," he said. "I don't feel that way anymore. You need a psychological milieu which JoAnne knows how to create. Her 'Henry IV' is six hours of Shakespeare I really enjoyed. I think she and Kevin would make a wonderful alliance."
