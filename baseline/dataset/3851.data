When mothers in the United States, Sweden and Russia nuzzle their infants and croon baby talk, they are giving their babies a lot more than tender loving care, scientists have found. The women are producing highly exaggerated speech sounds that provide the basis for all subsequent learning of that language.

Baby talk is much more important than people realize, said Dr. Patricia Kuhl, chairwoman of speech and hearing sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle and the lead author of a new report on the university of ''parentese'' -- the sing-song, exaggerated speech pattern that people use when talking to infants.

''Parentese has a melody to it,'' Dr. Kuhl said. ''And inside this melody is a tutorial for the baby which contains exceptionally well-formed versions of the building blocks of language.''

In a study published today in the journal Science, Dr. Kuhl and her colleagues found that mothers in the the three countries stretched out or exaggerated the pronunciation of three primary vowels when speaking to their infants -- ''ee,'' ''ah'' and ''oo'' -- which are common to every spoken language in the world. This vowel stretching tunes the infant's brain to the widest possible range of vowel sounds, Dr. Kuhl said. As the baby learns the vowels of its mother tongue, the ability to hear subtle vowel distinctions in other languages is gradually lost.
