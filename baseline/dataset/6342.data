VIENTIANE, Laos, Jan. 31— The United States is planning an evacuation of thousands of civilians in the Plaine des Jarres next week in the expectation of a counteroffensive by Commu nist forces.

The Defense Ministry spokes man, Col. Thongphanh Knoksy, told newsmen that the Laotian military expected the North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces to open a major attack no later than mid‐February.

American officials and most diplomatic and military observ ers from other countries agree that an offensive is likely. They expect the Communist forces to recapture the embattled region in central Laos, which they lost last summer after having con trolled it for more than five years. The conquest of the strategic Plains des Jarres was the most notable victory by the Royal Laotian Government in many years and military morale in this battered country still thrives on it.

10,000 Are Involved

The evacuation will involve 10,000 to 15,000 displaced per sons who were settled in the Plaine des Jarres after being evacuated early last summer during fighting near Xieng khouang, in the southeast.
