Many of the nation's large retailers yesterday reported sluggish sales in August. Industry analysts attributed the lackluster results in part to warm weather that left consumers in no mood to shop for fall and back-to-school clothing.

Other reasons cited for the drop-off include inevitable negative comparisons over a strong performance during August 1994, as well as a general insecurity among consumers about the economy, which has made them reluctant to buy something until they absolutely need it and unless they can buy it cheaply.

The August retail figures offered further evidence of a languid economy, also reflected yesterday in indicators released by the Commerce Department. It said that consumer spending rose only two-tenths of 1 percent in July from June, the slowest pace since April, even though incomes rose at the swiftest pace in six months. The Commerce Department also said that factory orders declined more than expected in July. [ Page D2. ]

Among retailers, discounters like Target registered noteworthy gains in same-store sales comparisons, while specialty-store apparel sellers like Talbots fared poorly. Talbots, the majority of which is owned by the Aeon Group of Japan, is historically a consistent and strong performer but it reported that same-store sales, or sale from stores that have been open at least a year, were down 4.4 percent.
