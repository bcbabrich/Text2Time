Two United States Navy warships, the cruiser Gettysburg and the frigate Halyburton, were heading towards the tanker to take the survivors on aboard, Daphne Osborne, the owners' South African agent, said in Cape Town. Two helicopters dropped medicines and supplies to the Hawaiian King.

What was to have been a sun-kissed cruise across the equator ended some 150 miles off the coast of Somalia when the fire broke out. According to survivors and shipping officials, the ship's engines stopped abruptly.

The vessel stirred debate last June when Italy's neo-Fascist National Alliance chartered her for a fund-raising cruise in the Mediterranean and, in response to adverse criticism, dropped a wreath into the sea in memory of Mr. Klinghoffer.

But for many Italians, the vessel was "The Big Blue Liner," named for the color of her hull, that plied the oceans from North America to Australia and once went around the world in 80 days, despite a chronicle of calamities.

Today's was not even the ship's first fire. In 1981, a blaze erupted aboard the Achille Lauro in the Canary Islands and two passengers drowned when they jumped overboard. In 1961, she hit a fishing vessel and killed a Neapolitan fisherman.

Some passengers were wearing ball gowns and tuxedos when the alarm was raised today, said Tony Webb, a British businessman who had been aboard and who told his story by radio-phone to The Evening Standard of London.

"We were alerted at 1:30 A.M. when we heard the engines suddenly shut off," he said. "Most people were at this social event and the captain came on and said we all had to go up on deck because there was a fire."
