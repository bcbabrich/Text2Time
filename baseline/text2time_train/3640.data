Game 6 is Saturday night in Ottawa. Game 7, if necessary, will be back here on Monday. Only 13 teams in National Hockey League history have won a four-of-seven-game series after trailing by 3-1. But 11 of those series have occurred in the last 11 years, most of them after underdogs, like the eighth-seeded Senators, took surprising leads over favorites, like the Eastern Conference champion Devils.

Brodeur, who stopped 22 of 23 shots in an aggressive and sparkling effort, began to work the Game 6 psychology even with his hair still damp from his Game 5 shower.

''It's a little closer at 3-2,'' Brodeur said. ''It's going to be tough for them. If we are able to get momentum in the first period, they are going to feel the pressure for sure.''

The Senators are also feeling some hurt. Defenseman Wade Redden left with a slight groin strain. The Devils lost one player, forward Jason Arnott, when his right wrist was accidentally cut on the bench during a player change and he required stitches.

Despite the victory, the Devils are not out of their slump, which began during the last month of the regular season with a 3-5-2 finish. They used their superior size to check hard against the younger, smaller Senators. But the Devils' top scorers continued to fire pucks that were stopped by Rhodes' pads or the posts.

Bobby Holik, who played his best game of the series, again failed to score, despite three shots on goal and one against the crossbar. Scott Niedermayer had four shots. Randy McKay had two. All seem just about ready to join the scoring column alongside Rolston, whose goal at 11:04 was his first of the series.

After Brodeur gathered a loose puck and whacked it off the side of the rink, it bounced and slid into the Ottawa end while Rolston sprinted down the left-wing boards and caught up to it in the face-off circle. He cut to the net, made a move to the backhand on Rhodes, and then stuck the puck between the pads and over the goal line.
