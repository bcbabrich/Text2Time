Big Bang

Tanglewood may be the summer home of Seiji Ozawa and his Boston Symphony Orchestra, but it's the Labor Day Weekend Jazz Festival that closes each season with a bang. Opening with the saxophonist Branford Marsalis and his quartet, the event continues Saturday with the festival premiere of Dianne Reeves, who has recently begun fusing pop with her skilled jazz singing. Dave Brubeck will be at the helm of Sunday's finale, playing classics from his six-decade career. Tickets and information: (617) 266-1200.

Fitting Tribute

It has been 10 years since Alvin Ailey hand-picked his star pupil, Judith Jamison, to lead the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. Now Ms. Jamison has yet another reason to celebrate: her first Emmy Award. On Saturday, the dancer, choreographer and director was honored with the Emmy for outstanding choreography based on her work in the PBS Great Performances tribute to her mentor, ''A Hymn for Alvin Ailey.'' Directed by Orlando Bagwell, the documentary combines selections from Ms. Jamison's ''Hymn,'' with interviews with Ailey, his friends and colleagues.

Tormented Souls

It took 34 years, but Lincoln Center's Great Performers series is finally leaving home. It will trade the Upper West Side for midtown in its season opener, ''Vers la Flamme,'' running at the New Victory Theater, 209 West 42d Street, from Sept. 15 to 19. Directed by the choreographer Martha Clarke, seven performers will pantomime five bristly short stories by Anton Chekhov, among them ''Enemies,'' ''The Darling'' and ''A Nervous Breakdown.'' Providing the mood music are 32 technically challenging pieces by Alexander Scriabin, which the pianist Christopher O'Riley will attack onstage.

Big Designs

Call it Galicia's reaction to Bilbao. Eisenman Architects, the New York firm headed by Peter Eisenman, has produced a winner -- this time for a cultural district in Santiago de Compostela, the capital of Spain's agricultural region and a major pilgrimage site. The competition, also entered by the architects Rem Koolhaas and Jean Nouvel, called for about 600,000 square feet for two museums, a library, an opera house, a lecture hall and a media center. Since the jury's announcement on Friday, residents have begun referring to Mr. Eisenman's design as ''the enchanted mountain.'' Carving into the top of one of seven mountains ringing the city, Mr. Eisenman plans to use indigenous stone to erect a series of half-buried, half ''earth-formed'' buildings grouped around public plazas. Already fully paid for, the $120 million complex is scheduled for completion by the end of 2006. KATHRYN SHATTUCK
