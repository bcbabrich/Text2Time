Motion picture rights to “Magic,” a forthcoming novel by William Goldman, have been acquired by Joseph E. Levine, who reported yesterday that he had paid $1 million for them.

Under the terms of the agreement, the author will also write the screenplay from his book, which is to be published by ??? in September.

‘‘Magic” is described as a contemporary, psychological thriller, dealing with a young magician‐entertainer who is having violent difficulties coping with success and failure and the forces that are trying to destroy him.
