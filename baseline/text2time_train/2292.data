POSTGAME: Colts 31, Jets 28

There were so many lead changes in a highly entertaining second half that it’s hard to sum up. Maybe you can second-guess Mangini for going for it on fourth-and-2 instead of kicking a field goal to try to go up, 17-14, but ultimately the Jets’ defense couldn’t stop Manning when it mattered. The defensive line didn’t put much pressure on Manning and he was able to pick the secondary apart. The most memorable part of the finale was the wild swing in the kickoff returns, with Justin Miller going 103 yards to put the Jets up, 28-24, then Leon Washingon misplaying a kickoff to bury the Jets deep in their territory on their final possession — and the final play, in which the Jets tried to lateral their way to the end zone. UPDATE: YouTube video of the Jets’ last gasp is here.

In the postgame show, Mangini is defending his decision to go for it on fourth down, saying that with the Colts’ explosive offense, the Jets needed maximum points.

Here are some of the final stats:

Manning and Pennington were typically efficient. Manning was 21 for 30 for 217 yards, and Pennington was 17 for 23 for 207 yards. Each had one touchdown pass, and Pennington was intercepted once, in the end zone on the fourth-down play.

Coles had 6 catches for 81 yards, another fine game, and Cotchery had 3 catches for 65 yards and a touchdown. Tim Dwight had 3 catches for 31 yards. The Jets’ running backs split their carries, with Houston gaining 49 yards, Barlow 35 and Washington 33. The Colts had great success running the ball, with Addai gaining 84 yards and Rhodes 75.

With not much separating the teams, the turnovers proved to be crucial, as they always seem to be. The Jets had two turnovers and the Colts none.

Given how the game started, with the Pennington fumble and the quick Indy score, the Jets acquitted themselves well, giving the Colts (4-0) all they could handle. The Jets fall to 2-2, with another tough game next Sunday, at Jacksonville at 4:05, but they have to feel they can stay with anybody after this game.

4th Quarter, Colts 31, Jets 28

Only 50 seconds to go. The Jets have one timeout. Leon Washington, for some reason, is back on the kickoff return instead of Miller. A squib kick by Gramatica GETS BY WASHINGTON, and he runs back and picks it up and gets tackled at the 2. DISASTER. The ball skipped by everyone, and the Jets will have to go 98 yards to win. A catch by Dwight takes the Jets to the 11. Another catch, this one by Cotchery, but there’s only 19 seconds to go. The Jets call a timeout, their final one. They need a long reception and a spike and a field goal. Coles catches a sideline pass for 7 yards and steps out, but it’s not nearly enough. The Jets need a deeper pass. The ball is tipped away from Cotchery. Eight seconds to go, no timeouts. Now it’s desperation time, no time to set up a field goal. A completion, and the Jets start a crazy series of laterals — about six of them. What a final sequence! It takes about 35 seconds as the Jets throw laterals all over the field, trying for their own version of the Standord-Cal game. Even Pennington gets into the act with a lateral, but now the ball is fumbled and the Colts recover. The game is over. The Colts win 31-28.

CBS cuts away quickly after the game, but on the radio, they’re saying that Coles is in pain on the field, and the Jets’ medical staff surrounds him. He was hurt on the final play. We’ll have to wait to how badly.

4th Quarter, Jets 28, Colts 24

1:19 to go. First down, Colts, on the Jets’ 16. Incomplete to Clark, way over his head in the end zone. Wayne with a catch at the half-yard line!! Manning rushes up, wastes no time, AND HE GOES OVER FOR A TOUCHDOWN. MANNING CATCHES THE JETS NAPPING FOR A QUARTERBACK SNEAK. Gramatica kicks the extra point, and we have another lead change. The Colts lead 31-28.

4th Quarter, Jets 28, Colts 24

Manning passes to Addai to the Colts’ 43 at the two-minute warning. Now it comes down to whether the Jets’ defense can keep Manning and the Colts out of the end zone. Really, a pretty entertaining game, with a bunch of lead switches in the second half. Maybe the Jets should root for Manning to score early so they’ll have time to score themselves. Fletcher catches a sideline pass to the Jets’ 48. Clock stops at 1:50. Fletcher is wide open on the left for a 10-yard gain. Again, he steps out of bounds, so clock is stopped. From the Jets’ 39, Manning finds Clark over the middle for 4 yards, to the Jets’ 35. Manning works quickly and the ball bounces away from Wayne; Vilma almost pounces for an interception. Manning starts running a draw, then stops, sees Harrison open, and fires to him on the right sideline for a big gain, to the Jets’ 16. The Jets, disorganized, call timeout to try to regroup. 1:19 to go. The Jets have one timeout left.

4th Quarter, Colts 24, Jets 21

There’s 2:34 to go, and the Colts have taken a 3-point lead. WHOOHOOO!!! Justin Miller goes 103 yards on the return FOR A TOUCHDOWN. He broke two tackles at the 40 yard-line and just kept going. THE JETS HAVE RETAKEN THE LEAD. Extra point is good, and It’s Jets 28, Colts 24.

The return was spectacular — a must-see on the highlights tonight. Gramatica grabbed onto his jersey and dragged him but couldn’t hold on.

4th Quarter, Jets 21, Colts 17

First and 20 from the Jets’ 30. Manning goes for the end zone. Incomplete to Wayne. Nice play by Justin Miller. Another pass to Wayne in the end zone — incomplete — but Miller is called for pass interference. The ball will be placed on the 8. Both players were pushing — maybe it should have been a no-call. A beer bottle is thrown from the stands after the replay is shown at the stadium. Kerry Rhodes goes over and tries to calm the crowd. Addai drives down to the 3-yard line. Manning is quick to the line, and Addai gains a yard. It’s third-and-goal from the 2.

Play action, Manning backpedals, and Manning finds FLETCHER, THE TIGHT END, OPEN FOR A TOUCHDOWN. Extra point is good, and the Colts lead, 24-21.

4th Quarter, Jets 21, Colts 17

The Jets have just taken the lead. They’ve played well in the fourth quarter of all of their games. Mangini will surely say it’s because of the tough training camp he ran. Wilkins returns it to the 32. 7:50 left. A short pass to Addai for 6 yards, then Addai runs for 6 yards. Addai for two yards. (Note: Addai was there for the Jets’ taking in the first round of the draft, but the Jets picked center Nick Mangold from Ohio State at No. 29. The Colts picked Addai, from L.S.U. at No. 30.) Addai is stopped for 2 yards. Third and 6, and the crowd is roaring! But Manning has time and he finds tight end Dallas Clark to the Jets’ 32. First down. Addai gains 4 yards as the clock ticks under 5:00. Harrison makes a catch on a quick slant for a first down. The clock is at 4:10. Manning is flushed out of the pocket, but he still finds Harrison at the Jets’ 20 on a desperation pass on an out route. Manning is in command! A holding penalty on the Colts after Addai gained five more. Vilma was held, and the Colts are going backward.

4th Quarter, Colts 17, Jets 14

The Jets have the ball at the Colts’ 18 at first-and-10. Handoff to Washington, who goes up the middle for 5 yards. Washington has been a revelation in the second half. Quick play, and Washington picks up three more. It’s third-and-2 at the Colts’ 10. Pennington is barking out the signals, 8:15 left, changing the play at the line. Incomplete, but the Colts are called for illegal contact on Coles, and it’s a first down. Barlow is hit at the 5, BUT HE KEEPS HIS LEGS CHURNING AND BULLS OVER FOR A TOUCHDOWN. TOUCHDOWN. A sweet run by Barlow after he was hit early. The extra point is good, and the Jets lead, 21-17.

4th Quarter, Colts 17, Jets 14

The Jets start with good field position, around their 38, after a short kick by Gramatica is brought back by the upback Matt Chatham. 6-yard gain by Washington. Nice catch by Coles on an out route for a first down. First down. The Jets are at the Indy 48. 11:50 to go. Washington finds a seam and goes for 6 yards. The Jets have really mixed it up in their running game, alternating Houston, Barlow and Washington (Houston is now hurt). Incomplete to McCareins, who probably should have caught it. But Coles makes a catch on the next play and breaks a tackle to the Colts’ 31. First down. Washington picks up 6 and 2 yards consecutively. BJ Askew picks up 5 yards for the first down with nine minutes left. The Jets do a hurry-up on the next play, and the Colts ARE FORCED TO CALL TIMEOUT. They weren’t prepared, and now the Colts are out of timeouts.

4th Quarter, Colts 17, Jets 14

Dungy came out ahead in that particular coaching matchup with Mangini, who elected to go for it on fourth down from the 2 and came up empty instead of kicking the field goal. Dungy took the sure points and the Colts have the lead.

Start of the Fourth Quarter, Jets 14, Colts 14

Rhodes finds plenty of room and runs to the Jets’ 14. Rhodes again for a couple, and it’s second and goal at the Jets’ 1. RHODES LOSES A YARD, Robertson with the tackle for the Jets. He had great penetration. Ball goes to Rhodes again on third down, and flags fly as he’s stopped short. Penalty against the Colts. The Jets decline. It’s fourth and goal from the 1, and Dungy, unlike Mangini, decides to go for the field goal and the lead. Gramatica kicks it through for a 17-14 lead.

3nd Quarter, Jets 14, Colts 14

Mangini is 1 for 2 on controversial decisions. The onside kick worked to perfection, but the decision to go for it on fourth down instead of kicking a field goal will be second-guessed. It’s easy for me to say, but since the Jets were on the 2 (the 2 1/2, actually), it would have been wiser to take the 3 points.

The Colts, on a third-and-2, get a first down on an Addai run. Harrison gets a first down with a catch out to the Colt 49. Big running room for Addai, and he gets to the Jets’ 40 for a first down. Addai again, and this time he gets 5, to the Jets’ 35. Addai again, for 4, and he’s a yard short of a first down. 30 seconds to go in the quarter. From the Jets’ 32, Manning gives to Addai, but flags fly. It’s a false start. Third down and 6 from the Jets’ 37. Wayne is wide open for a catch, and he gets to the Jets’ 23. End of the quarter. Jets, 14, Colts 14.

3nd Quarter, Jets 14, Colts 14

Houston is carted off the field. He couldn’t put any weight on his leg. The Jets are going for it on fourth down! Another surprise by Mangini! Pennington, on a play-fake, is pressured right away and THROWS AN INTERCEPTION in the end zone. Pennington was under duress, and now the Colts will be able to start at their 20 instead of their 2. The Jets get nothing and will have to like it after a time-consuming and well-executed drive.

3nd Quarter, Jets 14, Colts 14

9:12 left in the quarter. Barlow runs to the Colts’ 30. It’s third and 7. Coles comes back for the ball and makes a nice juggling catch for a first down. From the 19, Barlow gets a yard up the middle. A short dumpoff pass by Pennington, then Pennington draws the Colts offside. The Jets are at the 7. Houston gets 5 yards to the 2. After a 1-yard pickup by Houston, it’s third and goal from the 1. Pennington calls a timeout. The Jets are poised to take the lead, and this will be the 15th play of the drive, a drive that has chewed up eight minutes of clock. Here we go on a pivotal third down. Freeney gets into the backfield and stops Houston at the 2! Houston is injured, prone on the field. Now what will Mangini do? He probably needs to kick the field goal. The ball is at the 2. There is 4:55 to go in third quarter, and Jets trainers are on the field examining Houston’s knee. Timeout.

3nd Quarter, Jets 14, Colts 14

Pennington, starting at the Jets’ 21, completes a pass to Coles on the sideline after a play-action fake and a rollout. It’s a first down. Houston runs for 2. Houston runs again for 4 more to the Jets’ 37, and it’ll be third-and-four. Pennington feels pressure, and he runs and slides for a first down, just beyond the marker. Tony Dungy throws the red challenge flag; he thinks Pennington slid before the first-down marker. Seems to be a bad call by Dungy; it looked like Pennington made it. After a review, the play stands. The Jets are at their 41 with 11:50 left in the quarter. False start on the Jets, by Kendall, who is back in the lineup today. Houston, running behind Ferguson, turns the corner for a 4-yard gain. Pennington scrambles and hits Coles, and Coles beats his man after the catch for a first down at the Colts’ 46. Cedric Houston pierces through middle — the Jets’ ground game is alive! — and he gets to the 34. Pennington throws a jump ball for Coles near the end zone, and it’s incomplete. 9:12 to go. The Colts burn a timeout to get an injured player, Kelvin Hayden, off the field. Indy has one timeout left, and Dungy is steaming that there wasn’t an injury timeout called by the officials.

3nd Quarter, Jets 14, Colts 14

Colts start the second half with a short run by Rhodes to the 33. Quick pass to Harrison, and he gets to the Colts’ 47 — a 14-yard pickup. Harrison passes Andre Reed for fourth on the career list of receptions. After a short run and an incompletion, it’s third and 7. Manning under pressure, and HE’S SACKED BY ELLIS. A big loss and the second sack by Ellis. 13:00 to go in the quarter. The Colts punt. The Jets, an 8-point or 9-point underdog, depending on who you believe, are playing Indy on an equal footing.

HALFTIME, Jets 14, Colts 14

Welcome to the halftime report. The Jets seemed completely lost in the first quarter. Pennington coughed up a quick fumble, and the Colts took advantage with a quick touchdown. The Jets’ running game gained 9 total yards in the quarter, and the Colts were ripping off consistent chucks of yardage behind Rhodes and Addai. But the Jets turned it around thanks to:

1) Jerricho Cotchery, who continued the Jets’ success in YAC (yards after catch) with a nice run on a 33-yard touchdown reception.

2) Eric Mangini and Mike Nugent, who combined on a successful onside kick. Mangini had the guts to call it, and Nugent executed it perfectly.

Now have the Jets succeeded in merely making the Colts angry? We’ll see in the second half.

End of the half, Jets 14, Colts 14

Justin Miller gets a great return off to the 49, but Pennington is sacked (Robert Mathis’s second sack) and the clock runs out on the half, with the score tied at 14-14.

2nd Quarter, Jets 14, Colts 14

Addai is the lone back, and he picks up about four yards to the Jets’ 16. Manning passes to Wayne, and there may be a facemask against the Jets. The officials confer for quite a while. After lengthy deliberations, the officials say there’s no facemask — incidental contact. It’s third and 4 at the Jets’ 13. Addai catches a pass in the left flat and gets a first down, advancing to the Jets’ 9. It’s first-and-goal with 37 seconds to go. Harrison with a catch at the 2-yard line. Manning is hurrying up, and Addai SCORES FROM THE 2. TOUCHDOWN. The Jets were not completely set, and Manning tood advantage with a quick handoff. Addai went up the middle for the score. The extra point is good. It’s 14-14.

2nd Quarter, Jets 14, Colts 7

What the heck is going on here? The Jets were abysmal in the first quarter, and now they’re in complete command. Peyton Manning hasn’t touched the ball in about 10 minutes. Now Wilkins drops the ball on the kickoff and picks it up. Indy starts at its 15. A long bomb to Reggie Wayne. Wayne skies high to catch it! A great catch. And the Colts are at the Jets’ 44. Rhodes runs left and gains 9 to the Jets’ 35. Rhodes picks up a yard for the first down. The Colts are on the move. Play-action, and Manning just misses Harrison in the end zone. It goes off Harrison’s fingertips. Rhodes runs for 2. Third-and-8. Manning finds Harrison for a first down at the Jets’ 20. It’s the two-minute warning. It’s as if the Jets have made the Colts angry. I think the Colts may be shocked that the Jets are still in the game. The Jets were so pathetic in the first quarter that the Colts might have let down.

2nd Quarter, Jets 14, Colts 7

Houston slips and falls at the 11. The crowd groans. It’s second and goal, and Houston rumbles for 8 yards to the 3. It’s third and goal. Houston is providing some power running. Pass incomplete to Cotchery, but a flag comes out. They’re going to call pass interference. Cotchery was hit before he could catch it. Barlow STROLLS INTO THE END ZONE FROM THE 1. TOUCHDOWN, JETS. It completes an 11-play drive after the onside kick. Nugent is good with the extra point, and it’s 14-7 Jets.

2nd Quarter, Colts 7, Jets 7

An onside kick. A SURPRISE. AND THE JETS RECOVER. Mangini surprises the Colts with an onside kick, and Nugent executes it well. Kerry Rhodes — that man again — recovers for the Jets. The Jets are at their own 43, good field position to start. Another catch by Cotchery, and a gain of 18 yards, and the crowd is roaring. It’s a hurry-up offense, no-huddle. Barlow has room, to the 34. 9:25 to go in the half. Barlow again for a few yards. Third-and-2. Barlow is close to a first down, but he’s short. The Jets are going for it on fourth down. The game’s tenor has completely changed. Cotchery’s 33-yard touchdown catch and the successful onside kick have kick-started the Jets and the crowd. It’s fourth-and-1 and the Jets call timeout with 7:55 to go. Brad Smith steps under center again. AN OPTION. It works. Smith pitches out to Washington, and Washington makes a man miss and barely gets the first down. A risky move, but it works. A pass to Coles in the end zone is knocked away. A give to Barlow and he gains 6. All of a sudden, the Jets are controlling the clock and the game. 6:40 to go. A dumpoff over the middle to Tim Dwight, and a late flag. Unnecessary roughness against the Colts, and the ball moves to the Colts’ 7.

2nd Quarter, Colts 7, Jets 7

Jets start at their 35. 13:22 to go in the half. A short catch by Ryan, the tight end. Cedric Houston is the lone setback now, and he carries for a few yards. It’s third-and-1. Play-action, catch by Coles, but a flag at the line. Will the play stand? Illegal motion is the call (Chris Baker), and third down will be repeated. A momentum killer. It’s now 3rd-and-6. Pennington scrambles and completes a pass to Tim Dwight. First down beyond midfield. Houston gains 13 yards to the 33. That’s the Jets’ longest running play of the season. CATCH by Cotchery. Beautiful stiff-arm after a catch in the middle of the field. He goes left and stiff-arms a Colts defender near the goal line. TOUCHDOWN for the Jets if the play stands. Flag at the line, but offsides on the defense, SO THE PLAY STANDS. Nugent’s extra point is good, so it’s 7-7. Wait, a penalty on the extra point, so they’ll have to try again. It’s good again, and it’s officially 7-7.

2nd Quarter, Colts 7, Jets 0

Colts start at their 35 after a booming Ben Graham punt. The Colts have had no success through the air, but they haven’t needed it. Addai gets the call and he gets 3, then, and this is getting repetitious, Addai again, for a couple more. Incomplete pass by Manning on third-and-3. So we have two trends: The Colts are running the ball well, but Manning and the passing game have been ineffective. Go figure. The Colts punt.

1st Quarter, Colts 7, Jets 0

Jets start at their 5. Barlow again, going nowhere. The Jets haven’t had a first down! And they’re going backward with minus-19 passing yards. I think they’ve rushed for 8 yards! A short catch by Baker and a gain of 5 yards. Brad Smith is the QB, and Pennington lines up wide, and Smith runs for a first down. The Jets’ first good offensive play, with a little trickery! A poor pass by Pennington, and Coles can’t get it. Third down and 12. Four receivers for the Jets. The fans hate this call — a draw to Washington, and he only gets a few. So the Jets punt. End of the first quarter.

1st Quarter, Colts 7, Jets 0

Colts start from their 35. Commercial: A Chunky Soup ad with Donovan McNabb and his mother, and I’m starting to feel hungry. (Must sit here and type!). Here the Colts go again, giving the ball to Joseph Addai, and he gets 9 yards. The Colts’ line is blowing the Jets off the ball. Addai again, for a first down. Colts are at midfield. Addai again, and the running-back-by-committee is in full roar. The Jets started by consistently giving the ball to Rhodes, and now they’re giving it to Addai on every play. On third-and-four from the Jet 44, the Colts have a false start. Surely Manning will pass. Manning calls timeout with 3:48 to go in the quarter. Manning escapes good pressure from the Jets (Erik Coleman and Bobby Hamilton), but the Jets force a punt. It’s a good one, to the Jets’ 5, with 3:12 to go.

1st Quarter, Colts 7, Jets 0

Jets start from their 30. Barlow goes nowhere — again. The running game is offering Pennington no support whatsoever. Washington showed some spark last week, but so far the Jets are going with Barlow. This time, Barlow loses a yard, and the crowd is not hiding its feelings — full-throated jeers. It’s 3rd-and-11, putting Pennington under the gun. Play-action, scrambling back, and Pennington is sacked. Another rotten start for the Jets in the first quarter. They haven’t scored in the quarter all year.

1st Quarter, Colts 7, Jets 0

The Colts start with 10:28 left in the quarter at their 40. Rhodes runs again, and he takes the pile out to the 48. Rhodes runs again for 3 yards for a first down. So far, the offense amounts to giving the ball to Rhodes. The Colts are taking a page from the Bills’ strategy — Buffalo just ran Willis McGahee right at ’em, and the Jets couldn’t stop him (JP Losman was a different story). Manning goes back to pass, and Shaun Ellis chases Manning and sacks him. ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE 36. Gets the crowd back in the game. The Colts punt.

1st Quarter, Colts 7, Jets 0

Well, if you’re a Jets fan, that’s a disheartening beginning. The Jets were adept at the turnover battle in the first three games — Mangini had made a point about it being a priority. They figured to need an almost error-free game to beat the Colts, and they’re already heading in the wrong direction. Leon Washington loses a yard after slipping as the Jets start over. Barlow gets nothing on the next run, and they’re back to the line of scrimmage. On 3rd-and-11, Pennington completes a short pass, but it’s not nearly enough for a first down. Dwight Freeney sniffed it out. The crowd grumbles. It’s three-and-out.

1st Quarter, Colts 0, Jets 0

Pennington hit from behind on the third play from scrimmage, and the ball IS LOOSE. Pennington fumbles after being sacked. The Colts recover on the Jets’ 26. The Jets had advanced to the 39 on a Colts penalty and a nice run by Barlow. But an awful start for the Jets. And now Dominic Rhodes runs to the 11. Rhodes again, and he goes to the 6. Rhodes again, AND HE SCORES FROM THE 6. TOUCHDOWN. He powers over with 12:28 left in the first quarter. A similar start to last week’s; the Bills scored on the second play from scrimmage. It’s 7-0 Colts. Already.

Moments away from kickoff. The Jets win the toss and will receive. Short kick; Chris Baker takes it out to the 26, and that’s where the Jets will start. The crowd is raucous. The field is a little damp, but the weather doesn’t seem bad.

UPDATE: Laveranues Coles (calf) is active for the Jets. He played through the calf injury last week and had 10 catches for 78 yards. Colts receiver Brandon Stokely (ankle sprain) is out.

Pregame prediction from ESPN Radio’s Greg Buttle, former Jets linebacker: Colts win, 34-30. But he predicted the Bills would win last week.

……………………………………………………………………

Hello, all. I hope I can be of service today, whether you’re watching the game on TV and would like to comment or whether you’re following it from afar, in North America or around the world.

I’m reporting live from my den in Westchester County, via the CBS broadcast and the Jets radio broadcast. I’m going to try to sit here and type for four hours (without getting up), putting my bladder on the line for you. What can you do for me? Send me a message on Jets-Colts or anything that strikes your fancy.

First, some news. ESPN is reporting that the Colts’ Adam Vinatieri will not kick. Vinatieri’s sore groin acted up in warmups. Martin Gramatica will kick for Indianapolis.

Here’s some recommended pregame reading: Greg Garber’s ESPN.com article on Chad Pennington’s journey to recovery. Pennington talks about how he took steps to improve his arm strength (he’s never going to have a great arm, but he’s not lobbing the ball the way he did last year). An excerpt:

He and his father Elwood watched clips of Pennington and compared it to footage of strong-armed quarterback John Elway. “Having two shoulder injuries, it showed some flaws in my mechanics,” Pennington said. “I always thought I used my body well to throw, but I really didn’t. I was really an arm thrower and that’s why the ball would die on me a lot. That’s why my feet sometimes weren’t planted in the ground when I was throwing, and the ball would flutter.

“And so, I really had to look at that.”

The Jets are a surprising 2-1 and the Colts are an unsurprising 3-0 and an 8-point favorite at Giants Stadium. Last season, Indy became the fourth NFL team to start 13-0. Of course, we all know what happened in the playoffs last season — and the Colts’ history as underachievers in the postseason in general. But in the regular season? Pretty hard to beat.

Some pregame notes:

In a Rush: The Jets will want to try to control the clock and keep Manning off the field. But they only rushed for just 74 yards on 24 carries last Sunday, and they have gained only 217 rushing yards this season (an average of 2.6 yards). The Jets’ longest run from scrimmage is Brad Smith’s 12-yard end-around against the Titans in the opener. Smith, the former Missouri quarterback, has one catch, for 13 yards, in his rookie season as a wide receiver. He was one of the most exciting college players of the last few years, and we’ll see if he gets more action today — perhaps in a trick play.

Wayne’s Burden: After the Colts’ victory over Jacksonville last week, Reggie Wayne flew to Louisiana to help his family make funeral arrangements for his older brother, Rashad, who died in an car accident last Sunday. Wayne is expected to play today.

Turnovers: In an article in The Times yesterday, Eric Mangini said that the stat that mattered most to him was turnover differential. The Jets are plus-5 this season, tied for second in the AFC. The former Jets linebacker Bryan Cox, now a Jets assistant, charts every fumle and interception at every game and practice. “Turnovers have the biggest correlation to winning a game,” Jonathan Vilma said. There was no better example than last week. The Bills outgained the Jets, 475-256, but lost the turnover battle, 3-0, and the game, 28-20.

Awards: Lavenanues Coles was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Month. He leads the league with 24 catches. His 331 receiving yards are the most by a Jet in the first three game of a season since Don Maynard’s 356 in 1968 (the Jets went on to win the Super Bowl — their only Super Bowl victory and their only Super Bowl appearance.)

D’Brickashaw Ferguson vs. Dwight Freeney: a classic matchup of sack specialist versus left tackle. Michael Lewis, the author of “Moneyball,” has raised awareness about how pivotal the left tackle-defensive end showdown can be, in an excerpt from his latest book in Sports Illustrated, and in another excerpt in The New York Times magazine (well worth reading; click here).

Masters of disguises: Manning and Pennington are brilliant at ball-handling — maybe the best two in the league. By ball-handling, we mean hiding the ball after a fake handoff and setting up a play-action pass. Something to keep an eye on.
