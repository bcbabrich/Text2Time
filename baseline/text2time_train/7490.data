Stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange closed last month with a small decline, on average, in dull trading.

Hectic trading was dominant in the first week of August, due to international tension in Southeast Asia. However, after that flurry of trading excitement ended, the market settled into a dull trading pattern for the final 16 sessions of the month.

On August 3 President Johnson ordered “retaliatory action against gunboats and certain supporting facilities in North Vietnam after renewed attacks against American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin.”

The following day volume spurted to 4.78 million shares from 3,783,745 on Monday and the New York Times combined average fell 7.38 points. Volume was heavy on Aug. 5 as the market rallied and rose at the close of trading when it was learned that this nation's offensive action in the Gulf of Tonkin would be of a limited nature. Sales on that day totaled 6,166,015 shares.
