Many of the details of the bribery of Japanese politicians by the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation in the late 1950's, in connection with the sale of the F‐104 fighter plane to Japan, were reported at that time to the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency in Washington, according to a former C.I.A. official and Japanese sources.

Although the C.I.A. was aware of the bribery almost disclosure of the payoffs did not come until last Feb. 4 in hearings of the Senate subcommittee on multinational corporations.

The scandal has created international tensions and touched off worldwide investigations of the payments by Lockheed and other American companies to various parties in Europe, Japan and the Middle East to win lucrative multimillion‐dollar sales contracts for various products ranging from aircraft to pharmaceuticals.

The Lockheed payoffs in Japan, involving $12.6 million over a period of 20 years, were made to top officials of the Government, primarily through Yoshio Kodama, an influential power broker in Japan who has already been identified as the most important behind‐the‐scenes representative of Lockeed at that time.
