Unlike the tally for American servicemembers, no official count is availablefor the number of civilians killed in Iraq.Estimates based on mortuary tallies, newsreports and household surveys vary widely.

Using figures provided by the Iraq Ministryof Health, which counts violent deaths athospitals across the country, and Baghdad'scentral morgue, the United NationsAssistance Mission for Iraq has estimatedthat more than 28,000 Iraqi civilians werekilled during the first 10 months of 2006, anumber 40 times higher than the number ofAmerican service members killed duringthat time.

The American military has criticizedthe civilian count as high, but it has notreleased statistics of its own. In its quarterlyreports to Congress, the Pentagon hasprovided a rough estimate of the number ofIraqi civilians and security forces killed orwounded by insurgents. That number hasrisen sharply, to an average of more than 90a day since last May.

In an off-the-cuff estimate during anofficial visit to Vienna in November, Iraq'shealth minister, Ali al-Shimari, said that150,000 Iraqis had been killed in violencesince the war began in 2003, the AssociatedPress has reported.
