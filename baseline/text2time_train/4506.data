AS the corn season begins to fade, there is a sense of urgency about savoring it at every possible moment. Although corn would not ordinarily appear in an authentic dish of curried chicken, it fits perfectly, adding a pleasing sweetness and crunch.

If you wish, serve the chicken over plain rice. To cool the heat of the curry, a yogurt-cucumber dish called raita is traditional. And when summer is long past, this dish can still be enjoyed. Just make it with frozen corn.
