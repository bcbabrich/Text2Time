Jeff Perrone

'Asia, Africa and the Americas'

Holly Solomon Gallery

172 Mercer Street

SoHo

Through Aug. 23

For this small show tucked away in Holly Solomon's basement gallery, Jeff Perrone has created four expansive collages incorporating textiles from Africa and India with his own charmingly painted ceramic plaques.

Each work is composed of staggered panels of fabric spliced together so that their colors and patterns -- checks and dots and stripes -- set up a gently syncopated visual field. Against this rhythmic ground other elements appear: circles of cowrie shells, glyphic figures and words, Mr. Perrone's pictures of Turkish flowers and Hindu gods.

The result is an exercise in Pattern and Decoration orthodoxy straight from the 1970's (Mr. Perrone owes much to the example of the artist Kim MacConnel, who is having a concurrent show upstairs) and prompts conflicting reactions.
