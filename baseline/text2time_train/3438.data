''If we do a joint venture with anybody,'' she said, ''we want them to be major corporations. Apart from the consumer audience, your advertiser audience is saying, 'Gee, Dow Jones and Hearst,' or 'Gee, Miramax and Hearst are behind this,' then they know we're putting a lot of resources and talent and energy behind the product that an individual entrepreneur just doesn't have.''

Like her company, Ms. Black is frill-free. A self-described Catholic schoolgirl from Chicago, she started her career at Holiday magazine, then moved to New York magazine, becoming advertising manager of Ms. Magazine when it was founded by Gloria Steinem in 1972. (''It was real lick-your-own-envelopes-at-midnight work,'' she said.) She was named publisher of New York in 1979, but made her mark at USA Today as publisher in the 1980's by smartening it up in the eyes of advertisers wary of a newspaper nicknamed ''McPaper.'' In 1991, she became president of the Newspaper Association of America and then moved to Hearst as president of the magazine division in January 1996. (Her husband, Tom Harvey, is a lawyer; they have two children, a dog, and a country house in Connecticut.)

Hearst is a privately held company, and Ms. Black will not discuss numbers -- even good ones, choosing instead to highlight the successes of Smart Money and Cosmopolitan. In an effort to build on Cosmopolitan's growth and the popularity of magazines for teen-agers, Cosmopolitan plans to test a title aimed at teen-age girls in the fall.

But onlookers say Hearst is still not sufficiently focused on fresh editorial product. One advertising agency media director who works with Hearst and spoke on the condition of anonymity said: ''Nothing's really happened since she's gotten there. At Conde Nast, they love to toss the thing around. You get the sense that they're constantly stirring the pot. At Hearst, it still feels status quo.''

But John Fennell, the chief operating officer at Hachette Filipacchi, who has worked with several editors who are now at Hearst, said that Ms. Black had stepped into an insider culture. ''Hearst used to be a country-club, old-boy environment,'' Mr. Fennell said. ''For Cathie to step in at the level she did and make the changes she did, even if they are not enormous ones, was a dramatic move.''

Former Hearst editors say the company's culture is not directed toward creative tinkering. ''At Conde Nast, editors are treated like entertainment impresarios. At Hearst, they're expected to put on green eyeshades and sign expense vouchers from the photo department,'' said Randall Rothenberg, an editor at Wired, which is owned by Conde Nast, and a former executive editor at Esquire, which is owned by Hearst.

But Ms. Black sees no conflict between the bottom line and creativity.

''We have an incredible group of lively, energetic, talented editors here, who break new ground every day,'' she said.
