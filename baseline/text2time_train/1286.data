WEDNESDAY’S PUZZLE — Have you ever been in a group where someone tells an “in” joke that only a few people understand? Those people who are “in” break up with laughter, and the rest of us are left wondering why we don’t get it.

That’s what we have going on here today, but don’t worry: you will be part of the “in” group and you will get this one. Today’s theme is a specific type known to constructors, and Peter Collins doubles our pleasure, but you’ve seen this before. The only problem is, I can’t tell you what it is or I’ll spoil it for you. So, off to work with you.

If you’re a fan of zombie movies, you should have no problem with 20 Across, or will you? I laughed out loud when I got that one. SUNRISE is way too early a “Stirring time” for anyone unless you happen to be a rooster. The clue for 55 Across has to be one of the best I’ve seen for LOO in a long time. The payoff to the theme at both 9 Across and 47 Down is an almost visual rendering of itself. Well done, Mr. Collins.

Did you confidently fill in SMELTS for 56 Across, as I did? Wrong! Apparently, I don’t know my baby salmon as well as I thought I did. The correct answer is SMOLTS. I’ve never referred to 5 Down as a suit, although I can confirm that the “two-piece” part is accurate. I realize that UNHATS is a legit word, but it sounds clunky in my head. I will not forcefully doff my own lid over it.

All in all, a cool and literal example of something constructors ponder every day.

Your thoughts?
