A committee of creditors of the John David Company, Inc., met all day yesterday with officials of the retail menswear chain at its New York headquarters.

It is understood that John David owes its trade creditors some $1 million. The company also has about $750,000 debentures outstanding.

The conference was held in an attempt to unravel recentlytangled financial affairs of John David, which operates four stores in Manhattan, one in White Plains and another in Washington, D.C.

For about two months, rumors that John David was for sale or in serious financial straits were heard in the menswear market.
