As he took to the podium for the last time in the Blue Room, the chamber in the west wing of City Hall where news conferences are held, Mr. Giuliani did something truly unusual: he praised the reporters who have covered him and sparred with him for the past eight years.

''I'll have very, very warm memories of all the battles that I had in this room,'' he said. He allowed himself a few reminiscences: ''I'm thinking about all the times I said, 'That's jerky.' ''

Then Mr. Giuliani, who is still married to Donna Hanover, was asked if there might be wedding bells in the future for him and his very good friend, Judith Nathan, who attended the news conference.

''You guys are unbelievable,'' he said.

Then he expanded. ''I think that I'm going to do the best I can to keep my personal life as personal as possible -- not that I succeeded at that very well in the last eight years,'' he said. ''Judith and I are very, very close. We love each other. And then we'll describe all the rest of it when it's appropriate to do.''

When he was asked if he would grant his successor, Michael R. Bloomberg, some kind of grace period before criticizing him or his policies, Mr. Giuliani said that he did not think it would be necessary to do so.

He went on to point out that one of his predecessors, Edward I. Koch, had instituted the idea of a grace period when he was succeeded by David N. Dinkins, and joked that Mr. Koch sometimes seemed to be counting the days until he could start criticizing. He even impersonated Mr. Koch and his criticisms, using a loud, nasal voice to say: ''That's ridiculous! How could he do that? I would never do that.''

Then, last evening, he and Ms. Nathan walked out of his office in City Hall, applauded by aides and serenaded by bagpipers from the Police and Fire Departments. They shook hands and hugged and kissed staff members. Then they walked out the door, across the street, and down to a platform that had been erected on Fulton Street where people could view the site of the twin towers.

Finally, it was off to Times Square. There, minutes after the ball drop at the beginning of the new year, Mr. Giuliani administered the oath of office to Mr. Bloomberg. With that, he began his new life as former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
