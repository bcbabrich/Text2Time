POP/JAZZ

Lisa Stansfield: 'Affection'

Arista 8554; all three formats.

The debut album by Miss Stansfield, an English white soul singer who at various moments recalls Teena Marie, Cheryl Lynn, France Joli and Patti Austin, has become an instant hit for obvious reasons. With the writing and producing team of Ian Devaney and Andy Morris, the singer has made an electronic high-gloss dance album of unusual consistency. The sound recalls the best pop-disco records of 10 years ago, while adding contemporary rhythmic seasoning. The arrangements are lush, the rhythmic grooves sizzling, and Miss Stansfield exudes the eager passion of a pop-soul ingenue who longs to go overboard. ''All Around the World'' is the catchiest among 10 strong cuts. -Stephen Holden

Carmen McRae: 'Carmen Sings Monk'

Novus 3086; all three formats.

Carmen McRae's angular, sour-sweet jazz voice is ideal for Thelonious Monk. For the most part, she hews faithfully to the lines, holding notes that sound odd until the harmony catches up and makes them right. Strain in her top voice is compensated by the authority of her bass, but some of the vocal settings are absurd. The pseudo-hip history Jon Hendricks devised for ''In Walked Bud'' is vocalise at its silliest. Ms. McRae tries it twice, miscuing in the live version but redeeming the song in the studio. Mr. Hendricks's words for ''Ask Me Now'' are better, and Ms. McRae hits the song perfectly, aided by Clifford Jordan's libidinous tenor and George Mraz's bass. '' 'Round Midnight'' and ''Ugly Beauty'' are other exotic gems. - Richard B. Woodward

The Notting Hillbillies: 'Missing . . . Presumed Having a Good Time'

Warner Bros. 26497-2; all three formats.

In this pleasant, low-key celebration of their country-blues roots, Dire Straits' leader Mark Knopfler and his old friends Steve Phillips, Guy Fletcher and Brendan Croker perform traditional songs with contemporary embellishments and original songs that have an old-time feel. At its most familiar-sounding, in Mr. Knopfler's one original contribution, ''Your Own Sweet Way,'' the record strongly echoes Dire Straits' laid-back style. The most fervent performance is Mr. Croker's rendition of Charlie Rich's ''Feel Like Going Home.'' But the music on ''Missing'' ultimately lacks the ambition and intensity of the country-blues of the Notting Hillbillies' mythical cousins, the Traveling Wilburys. - S. H.

Thin White Rope: 'Sack Full of Silver'

Frontier/RCA 9994-R; all three formats.

Thin White Rope, a band from Davis, Calif., plays rock-and-roll that belongs on the late, late show. The songs tell of bleak journeys through hidden lands strewn with ancient bones; the guitars seesaw drunkenly between heavy-metal hammering and ominously quiet folk-rock melodies. The lead singer, Guy Kyser, has a reedy, menacing voice like a killer poised on the brink of action. Making its major-label debut after three albums on an independent, Thin White Rope takes chances at the least expected moments: the scabrous guitar jam of ''Americana'' collapses midway through into ''The Ghost,'' a spooky rewrite of ''Amazing Grace'' echoing with lonely-prairie slide guitar. - Karen Schoemer

Van Dyke Parks: 'Tokyo Rose'

Warner Bros. 25968; all three formats.

A Southerner who moved west when California rock was young, occasionally collaborating with the Beach Boys, Van Dyke Parks has long obeyed his own muse on albums like ''Jump!'' and the soundtrack for Robert Altman's ''Popeye.'' His interest in the American past galvanizes this 10-song suite, which dramatizes, laments, investigates and grins at American-Japanese relations. Sustaining a tone like the innocence and hardheadedness of E. L. Doctorow's ''Ragtime,'' Mr. Parks begins in pre-Sony times. As history and dreams flash through the orchestral arrangements, they begin a century-long prelude to an even closer future the two nations may share. The songs employ a couple of guest singers and traverse brassy pop tunes, Pacific dance rhythms, cowboy songs and elegies. Mr. Parks concludes with ''One Home Run,'' a summit meeting of Tokyo and Nashville. - James Hunter
