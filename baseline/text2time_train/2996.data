ITT Industries, which has its corporate headquarters in White Plains, announced last week that it won an $8.3 million contract from the U.S. Army to develop sensors for detecting chemical and biological weapons.

The electro-optical sensors can detect and identify chemical weapon agents on surfaces. They are being designed primarily for military use, but can also detect chemicals inside buildings and at airports, in luggage and cargo, and by law enforcement and first responder units to identify chemical threats.

They would be mounted on military vehicles to be sent out before vehicles carrying troops. The company is making the prototypes in labs in Albuquerque, N.M.

ITT, which manufactures electronic components, calls its system the Laser Interrogation of Surface Agents (LISA) sensor system, and is building it for the army's Soldier and Biological Chemical Command department.
