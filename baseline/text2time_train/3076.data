To the Editor:

You write about workers who cannot afford to take early retirement (front page, Feb. 26), but there are also workers, mostly women, who cannot afford to retire even at age 70. Yet current law forces them to begin withdrawals from their individual retirement accounts after age 70 1/2, thereby making sure that their I.R.A. accumulation never reaches an adequate level. They are trying to fill a half-empty pail with one hand while the government is forcing them to empty it with the other.

What is the point of forcing people to draw on their I.R.A.'s when they don't need them, only to have insufficient funds available when they do need them? The law should be changed to permit people to leave their I.R.A.'s intact until they retire.
