LONDON, Dec. 31 ( AP ) â€”Mrs. Florence Ismay, widow of J. Bruce Ismay, the chairman of the White Star Line at the time of the Titanic disaster in 1912, died at her home today. Her age was 96.

Mrs. Ismay's husband, who survived the disaster, helped get women and children away from the ship for nearly two hours, escaping in the last lifeboat. He was later criticized for the leaving the Titanic at all, but was exonerated at both the American and British inquiries.
