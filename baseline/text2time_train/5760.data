The long-simmering merger between the Generals and the Houston Gamblers reached the boiling point yesterday when Harry Usher, the commissioner of the United States Football League, said that the clubs' owners would be at a news conference today to ''announce details of their teams' future in the U.S.F.L.''

Although league officials refused to elaborate, there seemed to be little doubt that Donald Trump, the New York real estate man who owns the Generals, and Stephen Ross, the New York real estate man who heads a syndicate that is buying the Gamblers, had finally concluded an agreement to merge their teams. Trump was unavailable for comment, and Ross declined comment.

''I heard it was all signed, sealed and delivered - we're going to be playing in New Jersey,'' declared Jim Kelly, the Gamblers' quarterback, who said he had been told of the plans by Gambler officials.

Kelly, the league's leading quarterback last season, would be expected to take over as quarterback of the merged teams, but it was unclear what might happen to the Generals' starter, Doug Flutie, the high-paid rookie from Boston College who was signed to a long-term contract by Trump after he won the Heisman Trophy last fall.
