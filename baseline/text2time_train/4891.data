Alcide Chaisson, who is 69 years old and lives in a trailer near Crystalaire Airport, a small field northeast of Los Angeles, was charged Friday with obstructing a flight path. He said small planes buzzing his desert home drowned out his radio and he fought back by flashing sun into pilots' eyes with a 4-foot-square mirror. If convicted, he could get six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.
