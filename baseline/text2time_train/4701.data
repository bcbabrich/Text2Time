Q. Do you expect a lot of celebrities to come in?

A. Well, I do, because I've always treated them really well, but I am not really concerned about them. I'm more concerned about my own celebrities -- the people who have followed me. I used to work two days at Le Madri, two days at Coco Pazzo, two days at Sapore. Wherever I go, they go. It's pretty much the same crowd. Calvin Klein. Ralph Lauren. Donna Karan. People like that. Billy Joel.

Q. Have you become friends with a lot of them?

A. Through the years, they invite me to their parties, to their houses. Like Martha Stewart invites me to her house in the Hamptons every time she has a party.

Q. Do you think your restaurant could become too trendy?

A. No, because I don't want to be trendy. I also want to get my neighborhood people. I treat everybody fine. You never know who anybody is. I want to start the trend of being nice.

Q. Your former boss, Pino Luongo, recently said you'll need more than your "cute face and Spanish accent" to be successful. How did you take that?

A To be honest, I expect more than that from him. I think when somebody leaves you on good terms, somebody who gave you their heart, their blood, everything you have in yourself, I think you should shake their hand and say good luck. I think that was very unfair.
