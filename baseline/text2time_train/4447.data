QUINN BUCKNER, a former Indiana University and National Basketball Association player with no coaching experience, will be offered the coaching job of the woeful Dallas Mavericks this week, according to a report yesterday in The Dallas Morning News.

The News quoted team sources as saying that club officials are confident Buckner will accept the offer. But the 38-year-old Buckner would not take over as coach until next season, the sources said, leaving interim Coach GAR HEARD in charge for the rest of this season.

The Mavericks are 4-48 and are on a pace to finish with the worst record in N.B.A. history. (AP)
