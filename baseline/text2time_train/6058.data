SURROUNDED by repeats and a generally uninspired schedule, more energetic viewers might consider a visit this weekend to the film and video department of the Whitney Museum at Madison Avenue add 75th Street, A 70‐minute history of bloadcasting, produced by TVTV is being shown several times each day through Sunday.

The project was presented in piecemeal fashion on public television as “fillers” of various lengths following sayeral productions in the “Visions” series. Using solid facts and selective dramatio recreations, TVTV, a group of video documentarians and satirists, traces brpadcasting from marvelous toy to incredible money‐making machine. In some cases, the names of major characters have been changed to demolish the guilty and avoid harassing lawsuits.

At home, one of the few presentations with even minimum pretensions to originality is something called “The Star Show.” This hour was produced by Group W as a pilot for a possible fill serest. It can be seen Sunday at 9 P.M. on WNEW/Channel 5. Revlon is the main sponsor.

The product is comedy of a sort that falls between the standup routines of Bob Hope and the lampoon outrageousness of a “Saturday Night Live.” As Jimmie Walker, the host, explains: the format was designed to show “where all the up‐and‐coining people are coming‐from.”
