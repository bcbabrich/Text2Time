An article on BusinessWeek’s Web site Thursday starts the following way:

Amid all the carnage that has surrounded Enron‘s collapse, one player in the drama has remained remarkably unscathed: Vinson & Elkins, the giant Houston law firm that played a central role advising the company throughout its spectacular rise and fall.

Well, it turns out that V&E is scathed — to the tune of at least $30 million.

In a press release Thursday afternoon, Enron’s bankruptcy estate confirmed details of a settlement with Vinson & Elkins that BusinessWeek said was in the works. Specifically, the law firm has agreed to pay $30 million to settle all the estate’s legal claims against Vinson & Elkins. The firm will also waive $3.9 million in legal fees for previous work.

Vinson & Elkins’ Enron-related troubles are hardly behind it, however. BusinessWeek explains that Enron’s former shareholders are also targeting the firm:

And in the same class action in which they have targeted the banks, plaintiffs’ lawyers are preparing to unleash a new volley of evidence on June 13 to support allegations that V&E should be liable for some of the $40 billion in investor losses resulting from the energy giant’s collapse.
