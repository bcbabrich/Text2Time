Looking coldly at Patrick R. Bennett, a man convicted of one of the largest financial swindles in American history, Judge John S. Martin of United States District Court in Manhattan issued an extraordinary pronouncement yesterday: that Mr. Bennett's prison sentence will be either 20 years or 30 years, depending on whether or not his wife turns over their house and other property to creditors.

Judge Martin has repeatedly accused Mr. Bennett, 47, and his wife, Gwen, of conspiring to place the $400,000 home -- on a horse farm near Syracuse -- and other assets in her name. Such a move would safeguard the property in any effort to provide restitution to the 10,000 investors, many of them elderly, who were cheated out of $600 million by Mr. Bennett.

Mrs. Bennett -- who was not in the courtroom yesterday -- has insisted that the property is legitimately hers, and the judge said that he would put her claims to the ultimate test, leaving it up to her, in effect, to decide how much time her husband will spend in prison.

If she gives up the property by April 28, Judge Martin said, he will sentence Mr. Bennett to 20 years. If she does not, he said, Mr. Bennett's prison sentence will be 30 years.
