Germany's biggest bank, Deutsche Bank AG, acknowledged yesterday that it had dealt in Nazi gold during World War II and said it ''regrets most deeply injustices that occurred.'' But it declined to say whether its wartime officials knew that some of the gold might have come from concentration camp victims.

The publication yesterday of a historian's report commissioned by the bank, and the bank's response to it, seem certain to strengthen, and possibly expand, a class-action suit brought by lawyers in New York on behalf of Holocaust survivors against both Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank. Both banks have long been regarded by other historians as having played key roles in the financing of the Nazi war effort.

''Of course these transactions took place,'' said Ronald Weichert, a Deutsche Bank spokesman, referring to the report's conclusion that the bank had bought more than 4.4 tons of gold from the Reichsbank, the onetime central bank. ''This gold business was normal business during the war.'' At wartime values and exchange rates, the gold was worth some $5 million, about one ninth of its estimated worth today.

The bank commissioned historians from Israel, the United States, Britain and Germany to produce an independent report on its wartime gold dealings -- part of a wave of inquiries inspired by developments in Switzerland. The Swiss central bank was the biggest single purchaser of looted gold acquired by Nazi Germany from countries it occupied and from individual Jews robbed as they faced death in extermination camps.
