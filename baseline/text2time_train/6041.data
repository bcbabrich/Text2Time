The quiet passage of the tenth anniversary of the National Organization for Women belies the profound change in America's consciousness generated by the women's movement. Initially, feminist claims were jarring, even enraging. Though the demands were not, in retrospect, so exceptional—mainly those of college‐trained women to be integrated equally into the work force—they posed startling challenges to conventional attitudes.

In a decade, the country has changed. The women's movement has unleashed a new literature, new social criticism, new talent. Few men would now be insensitive enough to sum up the movement's appeal the way one comedian did a few years ago: “Sure, my wife joined the feminists. Why not? They all want somebody to help with the dishes.” Solid gains in legislation, business, labor and government clearly have been made.

Meanwhile, the movement has broadened and deepened—and so has the opposition. The change is .best symbolized by the fact that NOW's new president, Eleanor C. Smeal, bills herself as a housewife, a description any good feminist would have disdained seven years ago. Mrs. Smeal's view, which is emerging in the organization, is that the work women do, whatever it is and wherever it is done, has value that must be recognized; and that most women are still in “women's jobs” as housewives, secretaries, clerks. Bringing dignity and appropriate compensation’ to such jobs, NOW believes, will be harder than gaining entrance at glamour levels to previously male precincts. That problem is exemplified by the trouble NOW and its allies are having mustering the last three states needed to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution.

The women's movement is learning, as the civil rights movement did before it, that beyond the heady early victories lies the hard‐scrabble of institutional reality. The contributions of the women's movement have already been enormous and it appears that NOW is prepared to lead the movement down the harder roads ahead.
