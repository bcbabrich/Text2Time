There were ratholes in the kitchen and ratholes in the toilet. Rats could enter through wide openings in a bedroom ceiling where half the plaster had fallen down. Yet four of the Hendricks children would have to sleep on the floor, and their only protection as they slept would be Queenie, a dog scarcely bigger than a rat.

From her tightly budgeted funds, Mr. Hendricks had bought rat poison. She treated one room at a time, being careful to close the doors so Queenie couldn’t get at the poison. She thought she had killed several rats, because the poison was gone. Then on Monday the children saw a “Jocko” rummaging in the garbagestrewn court. A Jocko is a large rat.

Last night, no rats intruded the Hendricks flat. Queenie patrolled all the rooms, checking every rathole, but the only evidence of their presence was an occasional sound of scurrying behind the plaster.

“They are educated rats,” explained Mrs. Hendricks in a tone of apology. “Because you want to see them, they won’t come out.”

The children put on overcoats to go to the adjacent bathroom. When they returned—Jimmy, 6; Sharon, 7; Shirley, 10, and Fernando, 12—they burrowed under the pile of blankets covering the mattresses. The elder girls retired, grumbling, to a room behind the kitchen where they slept on double‐deck beds.

“That room never got warm no matter how much heat it got,” complained Marjorie.

Except for Jimmy, who had a runny nose, the children seemed in good health. Mrs. Hendricks said all six were getting a square meal a day through the school lunch program, and after school she packed them off to the Milbank Center for exercise.

Fernando ran to his mother's room and returned with three statuettes that he had won for first place in pull‐ups and second place each in push‐ups and sit‐ups.
