To the Editor: "Those Elusive V.A.T. Refunds" points out that these refunds are best handled by specialized foreign exchange firms. Our company, New York Foreign Exchange, although not mentioned in the article, makes such transactions as a daily routine. We process these checks, providing checks in United States dollars, either in person at our office at Suite 805, 61 Broadway at Exchange Place, New York, N.Y. 10006, or by mail. We do not charge a fee, and the rate of exchange is the one in effect on the day of the transaction. Our toll-free number is (800) 346-3924. LOUIS BARON New York
