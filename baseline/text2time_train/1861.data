Not so long ago, auctions for two-year-olds in training were a way for breeders to dispose of the horses they’d been unable to sell as yearlings and that they thought weren’t good enough to take to the races themselves. Today, those sales are a legitimate source of Derby contenders.

This year, 6 of the 20 Kentucky Derby entrants — Big Brown, Court Vision, Recapturetheglory, Visionaire, Denis of Cork and Big Truck — were sold as two-year-olds at auction (for an average price of just over $219,000), and another — Cool Coal Man — went through the auction ring but didn’t meet his reserve price and went unsold on a final bid of $850,000.

So, with 35 percent of the Derby entrants, two-year-old sales are definitely a fixture at even the highest levels of racing. This year’s field, in fact, is pretty evenly divided among three categories: homebreds, which are raced by their breeders; horses that sold as yearlings, and those who went through the two-year-old sales. So far, only one two-year-old sales graduate, Monarchos, has won the Derby, but more are sure to come.

Traditionally, the best racehorses were either homebreds or sold as yearlings, initially at the glamorous Saratoga summer sales and later at the high-rollers’ convention that is the Keeneland sale. The occasional big horse was auctioned as a two-year-old. For example, Sir Barton, the first Triple Crown winner in 1919, was sold the previous year for $10,000. But until the 1950s, there were no organized, recurring juvenile auctions. In 1952, Joe O’Farrell, the founder of Ocala Stud, and Humphrey Finney of the Fasig-Tipton auction company put on the first two-year-olds in training sale at Hialeah Park near Miami, then the site of the premier winter race meet.

At first, these sales were minor events, compared with the yearling auctions. But then, in the 1980s, as yearling prices soared, and foreign buyers became prominent in the U.S. market, the two-year-old sales started to take off, at first in California, where Japanese buyers regularly took home good North American-bred horses, and then later in Florida, especially in the mid-1990s, after Fasig-Tipton began its February two-year-old sale at Calder Race Course in Miami. That’s the sale that accounted for the most expensive horse ever sold at auction, the $16 million colt, named The Green Monkey, who eventually raced three times with not a single win before being retired. Other “select” sales at Ocala and Keeneland followed.

As the importance of these sales grew, so did the role of “pinhookers,” who buy yearlings and then train them over the winter in Florida and sell them as two-year-olds. And so has the importance of the “breezes,” when these young horses run an eighth or a quarter of a mile before the sale. A difference of a few fifths of a second in a breeze time can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars when the horse enters the auction ring, and the difference between profit or loss for the pinhooker who risked millions buying those yearlings.

Horses at the sales routinely run an eighth of a mile in 10 seconds flat, with the occasional breeze in 9.8 seconds, which will bring the seller millions. That’s a lot faster than horses run in races, and no indicator at all of how they might do going a mile and a quarter in May of their three-year-old year. If you go to the breeze shows before the sales, you’ll see dozens of trainers and bloodstock agents clocking not just the breeze, but also the “gallop out,” how the horse runs for the eighth or quarter of a mile after the wire. Not to mention the extra-slow-motion videos that the truly serious buyers and agents use, the vet exams, heart scans and similar attempts to separate the very best from the merely good.

The pressure on fast times — horses in the sales breeze faster than they will ever run in a race — leads to pressure on the pinhookers to have their horses as ready as possible. And that, in turn, leads to some questionable practices. To be ready to breeze fast, horses have to be trained hard through the winter before the sales. Many thoroughbreds just aren’t physically or mentally mature enough to stand up to that tough training, even if they might have turned out to be fine race horses given a bit more time. In fact, to pick up on a point Jim Squires made on this blog a few days ago, more and more of the horses that appeared at the sales seem to have been given steroids, often resulting a shock for the buyer, when he took the horse home from the sale and it rapidly lost all the glorious muscle tone that had been in evidence in the auction ring. The sales companies have now instituted testing for steroids, but only this year.

If Big Brown, or one of the other two-year-old sale graduates wins the Derby, you can look for even more attention to those sales in the future.
