In his five‐page opinion, Justice Murtagh made a passing reference to the methods employed in the Rao case. Justice Murtagh did not have to comment because, as in the cases of Irving Goldman, the city's former Cultural Affairs Commissioner, and Alvin Geller, a formen bureau chief in the Manhattan District Attorney's, office, he had decided to dismiss the indictments on more fundamental grounds.

At issue, the justice said, was whether the evidence before the grand jury was not legally sufficient to establish the offense charged. The justice found that when “Mr. Vitale,” whose real name he disclosed, and the undercover woman agent testified before Mr. Nadjari's grand jury, they gave statements to the panel that were “highly prejudicial to the defendants.”

Prosecutors in Mr. Nadjari's office familiar with the Rao case said the “opinions” given were necessary to establish a “fact pattern” that showed the perjurious statements of the defendants.

Justice Murtagh also criticized Michael Brown, the assistant attorney general handling the grand jury, for asking “leading questions” of the two undercover agents. The answers the agents gave, the justice said, consisted of “mere affirmations or denials of the prosecutor's questions.”

“There was not even a pretence at compliance with the rules of evidence,” he added.

Following is the text of the statement issued yesterday by Mr. Nadjari:

The public interest is not being served by the apparent and continuing hostility of Judge Murtagh to my efforts to carry out the Governor's mandate in his superceding order to investigate and prosecute all corruption in the criminal‐justice system.

Therefore, for the first time, I will speak out on the role played by Judge Murtagh.

Prior judicial consent was obtained by this office from Judge Murtagh before proceeding with the undercover activity in the Rao case for which I have been so severely criticized. Judge Murtagh was asked for his permission in writing. He declined. He gave memoral permission. The judge added that: ‘Using such techniques is the only way to pierce the veil of judicial corruption.’ There are witnesses to Judge Murtagh's assertion of approval.

During the appellate process, permission of the judge was sought to disclose that he had previously authorized the undercover activity. He refused to give tha tpermission, stating that he wanted no more criticism from the Appellate Division and that he would deny his authorization if I made, it public. If I disclosed the prior authority, het would deny he gave it to me.
