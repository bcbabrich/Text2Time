A Spanish high court judge has issued an international arrest warrant for an Algerian whose fingerprint was found on a plastic bag containing traces of explosives and seven detonators of the type used in the March 11 train bombings in Madrid.

The F.B.I. had mistakenly identified the fingerprint as that of Brandon Mayfield, a lawyer in Portland, Ore. Mr. Mayfield was arrested May 6 and then released from prison last week after Spanish authorities matched the print to the Algerian suspect, Daoud Ouhnane, 34.

In the warrant, issued Friday, Mr. Ouhnane is charged with 190 counts of murder in the train bombings and with belonging to a terrorist organization.
