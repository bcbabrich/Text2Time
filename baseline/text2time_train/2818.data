Many Ferris wheel fans stay on the Wonder Wheel at the Coney Island boardwalk for more than one stomach-flipping ride, but none take as many spins as Kato, who most days rides the wheel from the moment it opens at noon until it closes at midnight. Then it's time for Kato to get to work.

Not that he has a long commute. Kato is a dog, a mix of German shepherd and Akita, and when he's not riding the 150-foot-high Wonder Wheel, which towers over the Cyclone roller coaster, he's guarding it.

''He's on the night shift,'' said Dennis D. Vourderis, who with his brother, Steve, owns the Ferris wheel and 21 smaller rides and attractions surrounding it. From midnight to noon, Kato walks around the fenced-in Wonder Wheel compound. But when he's off-duty and it is not raining or too cold, Kato prefers riding the Wheel to heading home to the dog run he shares with the park's three other guard dogs.

Many people first spot Kato as he spins past in his specially modified cagelike car, while they are waiting in line. ''They think it's quite comical,'' Dennis Vourderis said. ''They try to get his attention, and then they see his head pop up. Sometimes he just barks at people in line.''
