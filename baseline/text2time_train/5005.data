Advanced Micro Devices Inc. will introduce on Monday a microprocessor chip that incorporates almost all of the components of the circuit board used in the original PC-AT personal computer.

The announcement is the first of several expected in the coming months of superchips that are expected to allow notebook-size personal computers to shrink even further.

In early personal computers, the microprocessor, which serves as the brain, was surrounded by dozens of other chips that performed ancillary functions, like helping the microprocessor interact with other parts of the computer. In recent years, companies led by Chips and Technologies Inc. have developed so-called chip sets, which consolidate these functions into a handful of chips.

But as the number of transistors that can be put on a single piece of silicon continues to grow, it is becoming possible to build the ancillary functions into the microprocessor itself. Advanced Micro's new chip contains all the electronics for a personal computer except the memory and a few specialized chips like one for drawing images on the screen.
