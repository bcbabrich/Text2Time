While commending New York City's water quality testing program, an independent panel of experts has made several recommendations that it says will help to assure the quality of the city's drinking water.

The panel of six water quality experts from around the country called for the city's Department of Environmental Protection to begin conducting the same number of tests on weekends and holidays as it does on weekdays. In addition, the panel urged that samples be taken in each of the five boroughs every day, a practice the department began in May.

"A city that has the size and complexity of New York's water system should take the same number of samples every day, including weekends and holidays, in each of the five boroughs," said Jack W. Hoffbuhr, the panel's chairman and the deputy executive director of the American Water Works Association in Denver. "That way, you have a good idea of what the water quality is each and every day, across the system."

Department officials said they had carried out all of the panel's recommendations, which were made in a report submitted to the agency in June. A copy of the panel's final report, which is to be released today, was made available to The New York Times.
