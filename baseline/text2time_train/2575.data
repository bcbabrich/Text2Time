The WPP Group, one of the world's largest advertising companies, said that revenue grew 5.7 percent in the first quarter of 2004, to £960 million ($1.7 billion) as sales increased in Asia, Continental Europe and Britain. Reported sales were down 2.7 percent in the quarter in North America from a year ago, though if currencies were constant, they would have grown by 10.8 percent. WPP billed £514 million ($912 million) in new business in the quarter, and reduced its net debt by 40.3 percent, to £797 million ($1.41 billion). Heather Timmons (NYT)
