Among the gentlemanly post-collegiate folk groups that proliferated from the late 1950's until the advent of folk-rock in the mid-60's, none had the hip cachet of the Chad Mitchell Trio, which performed a reunion concert on Saturday evening at Symphony Space.

Not only did the group's taste in material have a sharper political edge than that of its peers, but with a membership that included two first-rate folk-pop crooners (Mr. Mitchell and Joe Frazier) and one rougher-edged personality voice (Mike Kobluk), it also refined an unusually flexible vocal blend.

That blend was as smooth and tight as ever at Saturday's concert, at which the trio performed about 20 old favorites before an audience that seemed to remember every word. The concert was a reminder that the folk-pop style exemplified by the Mitchell trio fused modern barbershop with the folk music movement that had been gathering strength since the heyday of the Weavers.

Oh, how times have changed since the genteel button-down era when witty folk songs gently tweaking the Establishment could be considered subversive, and the voices doing the tweaking never rose above a tone of polite disagreement.
