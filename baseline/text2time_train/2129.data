As New York City election days go, next Tuesday’s is an uncommonly sleepy one with few races besides local judgeships.

Against that backdrop, the award for the Hottest Race in Town easily goes to the battle for Staten Island district attorney. It is a hotly competitive one that pits the Republican incumbent, Daniel M. Donovan Jr., against Michael J. Ryan, the Democratic candidate.

Mr. Ryan, a 42-year-old lawyer now in private practice, has run an aggressive campaign aimed at discrediting the incumbent, saying that Mr. Donovan has been inflating statistics about conviction rates and positioning himself for higher office at the expense of operating a well-run office.

An example of the fierce tone of the campaign is a television commercial in which Mr. Ryan highlights a Staten Island woman who accuses Mr. Donovan of setting free the man who sexually abused her daughter.

“Thanks to you, Mr. Donovan, there’s a sexual abuser walking the streets now,” the woman, Jo Marie D’Amato, says in the ad.



As with most races for district attorney, the candidates tend to frame the contest in terms of experience. Mr. Ryan, for

example, stresses that his years as a probation officer, and as a top criminal justice official in the administrations of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki, have provided with qualifications that far exceed Mr. Donovan’s.

“I have a long history of involvement in the criminal justice system,” he said. “And I have a better understanding of how

to get things done in that office. The incumbent is simply campaigning on a platform of inflated statistics for the sake of his own political agenda. Plus, he’s someone who is clearly positioning himself to run for higher office.”

To be sure, Mr. Donovan has been something of a rising star within the Republican Party virtually since his election in 2003. Early last year, Republican leaders in the state tried to persuade him to challenge Jeanine F. Pirro for the party’s nomination for attorney general — before Mr. Donovan had even completed his first term. But the district attorney decided against running, saying he did not have enough time to form the kind of campaign he would have liked before the September primary.

That kind of attention, he explains, is a result of the success of his office in the last four years. Mr. Donovan, like his Democratic rival, agrees that experience is the major issue in the race. “My opponent has not been a prosecutor for even one day,” he said. “He has a background in criminal justice, but not as a prosecutor.”

He defends the statistics he has cited in the campaign about the increased rate of felony convictions in Staten Island. “The fact of the matter is that the statistics we cite were generated by the same agency that my opponent used to work for, the Division of Criminal Justice Services of the State of New York,” he added.

“And every year since I’ve been here, our performance has improved,” said Mr. Donovan, who turns 51 on Election Day.

“We have the highest felony conviction rates in the city of New York. We have the highest rate of conviction for drunk-driving offenses. We have led the city in every measurable category there is.”

As in most Staten Island races, the endorsements in this one have been largely along political lines. The island’s Democratic officials have endorsed Mr. Ryan, and Republican and Conservative Party leaders are endorsing Mr. Donovan. (Mr. Donovan is also running on the Conservative and Independence Party Lines, while Mr. Ryan is also running on the Working Families Party line.)

For Mr. Donovan, the most notable exception has been James P. Molinaro, the Staten Island Borough president. Mr. Molinaro, a longtime Conservative Party official, took out a full page ad in The Staten Island Advance, criticizing Mr. Donovan as being responsible for fate of Mr. Molinaro’s grandson Steven Molinaro, who was sentenced to prison for violating his probation on charges of assaulting a newspaper carrier.

Mr. Donovan, who was Mr. Molinaro’s deputy before becoming district attorney, recused himself and instead turned the case over to a special prosecutor from Manhattan to avoid a possible conflict of interest.
