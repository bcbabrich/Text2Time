The National Park Service closed a 1 1/2-mile section of beach in Jacob Riis Park in Queens yesterday after more than 500 pieces of medical waste washed ashore on Friday.

The waste, which included hypodermic needles and empty medicine vials, was the first major dumping discovered in the New York metropolitan region since 1988, when the Federal authorities cracked down on illegal dumping after needles and other waste washed onto New York and New Jersey beaches.

The closing of the section, which includes all of Jacob Riis Beach and part of Fort Tilden Beach, both near Rockaway Point and part of the Gateway National Recreation Area, came during one of the busiest, and hottest, weekends of the year.

Officers with the United States Park Police, which patrols the Gateway area, posted warning signs yesterday and steered people away from the water. State and Federal officials have begun an investigation into who might have dumped the waste, tracing the batch numbers on the vials to the manufacturers.
