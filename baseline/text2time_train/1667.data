Tate Modern/BBC

The Tate Modern museum in London said that a revised plan for its $309 million dollar annex had been approved by city planners, BBC News reported. In 2006, Tate Modern announced plans for an 11-story extension, a series of glass boxes stacked up to resemble a ziggurat, designed by the Swiss architectural firm Herzog & de Meuron. That plan was given the go-ahead, but was later redesigned as a giant pyramid covered in bricks, and had to be resubmitted to a London borough council for approval. The new expansion, which will lead visitors into Tate Modernâ€™s Turbine Hall, is expected to be completed by 2012, in time for the Summer Olympics in London. Tate Modern said it had already raised about $106 million toward the cost of the extension.
