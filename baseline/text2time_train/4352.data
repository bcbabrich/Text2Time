Sol A. Shenk, who built a single surplus outlet in Columbus, Ohio, into the Consolidated Stores Corporation, an empire with more than 700 stores and annual sales of $1.1 billion, died yesterday in Columbus, his hometown. He was 83.

The cause of death was a heart attack, said Brady Churches, the company's president.

Mr. Shenk was best known for his purchase of the remains of DeLorean Motors, the automobile company founded by the former General Motors executive John Z. DeLorean.

When DeLorean Motors filed for bankruptcy in 1982, Mr. Shenk bought the remaining stocks of the exotic-looking cars with the stainless steel exterior and as many spare parts as he could find.

"We bought about 2,500 cars and 150 trailer loads of parts and sold every one of the cars," Mr. Churches said. "We sold about half of them to car dealers and retailed the other half."
