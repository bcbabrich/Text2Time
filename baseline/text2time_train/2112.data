The morning session has ended here at the annual meeting of the state Democratic Party in Garden City on Long Island. Most party committee members and county chairs have headed off to “break-out sessions” — rural Democrats, black Democrats, “reform” Democrats, and so forth — while in the central rotunda, various Democratic presidential candidates have send volunteers to man sign-up tables and hand out literature.

The Hillary Clinton table was, interestingly, not particularly well-attended-to, though it occupied pride of place in the rotunda — the first thing you see when you come down to where the conference is being held. Then again, how many state Democrats in New York need introducing to Mrs. Clinton?

Barack Obama’s table is thronged. In fact, it’s the only table getting much love.

John Edwards has gotten a little attention. Joseph Biden and Bill Richardson also have tables — less traffic on those ends, but a Richardson volunteer did see fit to walk over and say hello to reporters.
