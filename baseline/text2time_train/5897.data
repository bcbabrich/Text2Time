An official of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board has given a green light to a hostile takeover bid for the Home Federal Savings and Loan Institution of Palm Beach, Fla., in an action that could make takeovers of publicly traded thrift institutions easier.

Until now, the bank board, a Federal regulatory agency, has generally taken the position that anyone attempting an acquisition of a publicly traded thrift institution must first get advance approval from the board.

An action by Thomas P. Vartanian, general counsel of the bank board, appeared to modify this position. In giving clearance to the City Federal Savings and Loan Institution, a thrift unit with offices in Florida and New Jersey, to proceed with its hostile takeover bid for Home Federal, Mr. Vartanian said that advance approval was not needed for an acquisition so long as a merger application was filed with the bank board within 90 days of the acquisition.

His opinion was considered significant because of the delay that usually ensues in obtaining prior bank board approval of a planned acquisition. The delay gives management of the thrift institution to be acquired a chance to block the bid, if it wishes to do so, by trying to arrange a friendly takeover.
