But the farcically chaotic first-act finale is allowed to be its usual bubbly self, and the sublime trio “Soave sia il vento” to be simply, sincerely beautiful. In that number, the sisters beg the winds to be gentle as their lovers sail to war — the pretext for their deceit — so why didn’t we see Africans fanning them, making clear that breezes come from all kinds of sources? It wouldn’t have been subtle, but Mr. Honoré, known for films that owe a debt to the rambunctious audacity of the French New Wave, hardly shies away from blatant gestures elsewhere in the production.

His second act is more unsparing and harrowing, with seductions that take the form of surreal scenes tangling racial and sexual anxieties. As the sisters decide who will end up with which Dubat, a servant sponges their feet. Their duet becomes a spectacle of humiliation for him as they use him as a kind of mannequin, to try out gingerly the idea of loving — and having sex with — a black man. He gets in on the act, groping one of the sister’s breasts, until the intoxicating moment abruptly ends, and she shoos him away like an irritating insect.

The blackface makeup becomes a potent theatrical device. At one point, Ferrando washes some off himself, further confusing the frantic Fiordiligi, whom he is trying to seduce. This motivates a rendition of her aria “Per pietà” that, for both characters, simmers with mingled shames about racial passing and romantic betrayal. When she finally gives in, it’s part of an outpouring that finds her rubbing the makeup over her naked torso with a mixture of pleasure and pain: a shocking, wrenching image.

As the showiness of the first act yielded to the more serious, sustained intensity of the second, the cast was entirely on board with Mr. Honoré’s vision. Ending the opera alone onstage, pointing a rifle at herself, the soprano Lenneke Ruiten sang Fiordiligi with a fearlessly focused voice, a glint of stridency adding a note of urgency.

Kate Lindsey’s energetic, earthy mezzo suited the more impulsive sister, Dorabella, as Joel Prieto’s poised, airy tenor and Nahuel di Pierro’s smoky bass did the casually aggressive Ferrando and Guglielmo. Rod Gilfry was a gruffly nihilistic Alfonso, alternately resigned and snarling, and Sandrine Piau was sharply suspicious as Despina, the ladies’ guardian and Alfonso’s partner in crime.

There was no musical fat or plushiness here, as if the work had been shaved down to its sinews. In fact, it could have been even more sinewy: While the Freiburg ensemble played with crisp, light energy under Mr. Langrée, for a production this intense, more savagery in the sound might have been in order.

This conductor, orchestra and cast will present “Così” in concert at Alice Tully Hall on Aug. 15 as part of Lincoln Center’s Mostly Mozart Festival. It will surely be an impressive performance. But the New York audience will miss a dark, demanding staging that speaks all too clearly to our time.
