The Cardinals are the principal advisers to the Pope in the government of the church. They form the Sacred College of Cardinals, which has often been called the Senate of the church. However, since Ecumenical Council Vatican II met from. 1962 to 1965, Pope Paul has created a new advisory body, the Bishops' Synod. This group, made up of bishops —some of them cardinals—from all over the world, last met in the Vatican in the autumn of 1971. It is due to hold its next meeting in the coming year.

The most important task of the Sacred College of Cardinals is governing the church collectively as an interim administration during the period of the vacancy of the Holy See after the death of a pope and to elect a new pontiff.

When the 30 new cardinals join the college next month, it will have a record membership of 145. If the college were called to elect a new pope by that time and no changes occur during the next 31 days, 116 cardinals — including all the new ones—would be entitled to take part in the conclave.

Pope Paul ruled in November, 1970, that cardinals who have reached their 80th years might no longer participate in the election of a new head of the church. However, there is no age limit for eligibility to the papacy. This means that, theoretically, a cardinal who is over 80 may be elected pope.

Pope Paul is understood to be considering a reform of the papal election system by which some bishops who are not cardinals and possibly some selected priests would join the conclave. However, :several conservative cardigals are known to be opposed such an innovation, and it does not seem likely in the near future.
