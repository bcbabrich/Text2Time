During fashion week in Paris, the city puts on a festival of style, rather than a trade show like other fashion capitals. Parisians dress up to attend designer collections. It's all part of the Gallic cultural education, which spans the generations -- from youngsters, one here in a feather boa and another in a twin set, to a stylish 99-year-old wearing Issey Miyake, from shoes to hat.

Among the crowds during last month's shows were an African actor, second from left at top, in a leopard-collared Edwardian-style coat; three London fashion students in funky gear, far left at bottom; a Dior client in a popular camouflage outfit, top right; and the artist James Rosenquist, near left, with his arm around his wife, Mimi.

A Dior client, above, wore a spring jacket marked with ruching at the waist, which other designers were just exhibiting for next winter. For the evening shows, some women in the audience displayed a revival of the plunging neckline, above center.

Even the Paris street sweepers' apple-green uniforms, far right, are color-coordinated with their brooms, so quintessentially French.
