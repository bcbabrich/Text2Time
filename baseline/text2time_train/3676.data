Long before Robert B. Catell and Dr. William J. Catacosinos parted company yesterday, the two strong-willed utility company executives had established themselves as men of such different vision and personality that their partnership at the helm of the Marketspan Corporation seemed destined for trouble.

Mr. Catell, 61, had been president of Brooklyn Union Gas since 1991 and its chairman since 1996. He is the jovial public face of a company that gives low-interest loans to struggling businesses, seed money to rehabilitate dilapidated buildings and a postage-paid return envelope with every gas bill.

Dr. Catacosinos, 68, was enveloped in an entirely different sort of glow during the 14 years he ran the Long Island Lighting Company.

His tenure was dogged by controversy over his frequent pay raises and by bitterness over the high electricity rates, the highest in the continental United States, paid by Long Island consumers. It is a measure of their deep enmity toward the aloof Dr. Catacosinos that Long Islanders still publicly scold him for not immediately returning home from vacation after Hurricane Gloria knocked out power lines -- in 1985.
