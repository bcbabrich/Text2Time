Kiwi International Air Lines, a low-cost carrier with problems inside and outside the company since it started in 1992, filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday.

As a result of the Chapter 11 filing, Kiwi, based in Newark, said it would shrink its route structure to serve three cities -- Newark, Atlanta and Chicago -- and drop service to Tampa and Orlando in Florida, Las Vegas, Nev., and Bermuda.

Industry analysts said they had long been skeptical of Kiwi's chances of long-term success because of financial weakness from the time the carrier started service in 1992.

''Despite offering a fine product, Kiwi has been chronically undercapitalized,'' said Samuel C. Buttrick, an airline analyst at Paine Webber. ''It's surprising it took this long.''
