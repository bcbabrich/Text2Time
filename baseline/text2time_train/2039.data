We were told by spies for The Caucus that Fred D. Thompson was taking his stealth campaign for president here to New York, the media capital of the world. The venue? The St. Regis Hotel, for an event sponsored by Guggenheim Advisors, the giant hedge fund, where Mr. Thompson and Lawrence B. Lindsey were slated to deliver an “economic policy and national security briefing.”

So we rushed over. But our espionage failed us. “No press,’’ said the Guggenheim people. Then they sent a manager of the hotel, Harry Falik, who crisply but more politely asked us to leave the second floor, where the event was held. This failure in our intelligence capabilities was all the more galling, given that, if memory serves, James Bond himself stays in the St. Regis in the novel “Live and Let Die.’’

So we’ll have to rely on moles. Consider this an open invitation to the sea of pinstriped, Blackberry-toting guests to debrief us on the event in the comments section.
