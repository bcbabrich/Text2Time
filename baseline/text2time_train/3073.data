Excerpts in Business Day yesterday from oral arguments in the appeal of the Microsoft antitrust case, as transmitted by Federal Document Clearing House Inc., misattributed six quoted passages.

Judge David S. Tatel, not Chief Judge Harry T. Edwards, was the source of comments beginning ''The only comment that I could find''; ''So if this court decides to set aside the remedy''; ''O.K. So then we go back to statements prior to the conclusion''; and ''Is that your theory?''

Judge A. Raymond Randolph, not Judge Tatel, made the comment beginning ''Is there any indication who initiated these interviews?''

Judge Edwards, not Judge David B. Sentelle, made the comment beginning ''Are there some that might suggest it violates the whole oath of office?''
