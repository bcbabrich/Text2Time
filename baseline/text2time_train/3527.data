Simple confusion over whether measurements were metric or not led to the loss of a $125 million spacecraft last week as it approached Mars, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said today.

An internal review team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory said in a preliminary conclusion that engineers at the Lockheed Martin Corporation, which had built the spacecraft, specified certain measurements about the spacecraft's thrust in pounds, an English unit, but that NASA scientists thought the information was in the metric measurement of newtons.

The resulting miscalculation, undetected for months as the craft, the Mars Climate Orbiter, was designed, built and launched, meant it was off course by about 60 miles as it approached Mars.

''This is going to be the cautionary tale that is going to be embedded into introductions to the metric system in elementary school and high school and college physics till the end of time,'' said John Pike, director of space policy at the Federation of American Scientists in Washington.
