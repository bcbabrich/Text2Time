Publishers are well aware that even a best seller can turn into a financial dud with an overpaid author and a big print run. Over the last five years, print runs for best-seller candidates have been inflated from an average minimum of 50,000 copies to at least 100,000, and the shelf life of some other books has been compressed from four months to as little as four weeks.

''At times, it's like a big pyramid scheme where we keep shipping out the books and trying to hide the fact that there's a lot of dead titles,'' said Irwyn Applebaum, the president of Bantam Doubleday Dell, which is owned by Bertelsmann A.G. ''Everybody is on such overdrive to make do and grow and expand that they don't stop and study this. I think that an adjustment is going to have to come. But it's a lot like nuclear disarmament. Just because you reduce your books doesn't mean that the other publishers are going to reduce their copies.''

Returns are the most significant barometer of the financial success of a book, a measurement more critical than a ranking on a best-seller list because rejects cut directly into profits. Historically, publishers have agreed to take back returns and absorb the loss to entice bookstores to stock their titles.

Many of the major publishing houses report that their companies have managed to escape the phenomenon relatively unscathed, with returns -- as a percentage of gross sales -- that are either flat, declining or slightly above average.

However, figures from their own trade group, the American Association of Publishers, indicate that in the last five years the losses from returns have expanded far faster than gross sales, which are essentially the books that are shipped to bookstores. From 1990 to 1995, the industry's losses for rejected hardback books increased by 60 percent, to $531 million, while gross sales increased by 47 percent, to $1.64 billion.

Although the figures show that more money is coming in, the system leaves publishers at increased risk. More books are being shipped out, according to publishers, and more books are being returned. They are coming back in such consistent, rapid cycles that it has given rise to a debate about the efficiency of the industry.

At Random House, Mr. Vitale would say only that ''returns are higher than we would like them,'' although the gossipy industry is rife with talk about books coming back to the publisher by the truckload.
