Counterpoint is such a rare thing in jazz that the saxophonist Marty Ehrlich's show at the Knitting Factory on Saturday night, which was heavy with it, was almost shocking. Mr. Ehrlich and the saxophonist Stan Strickland, who lead the Marty Ehrlich Quartet, have been performing together since the early 1970's, and their improvisations together are bizarrely telepathic. Their lines tangle up, riddled with accidental harmonies, only to dissolve into a single high, keening note that then gives way to knots of sound.

Mr. Ehrlich, who was opening up a triple bill at the Knitting Factory, writes pieces that have mapped the vast plains opened up by Ornette Coleman; his compositions use odd, shifting meters, and everything from a chamber-music cleanliness and precision to full-bore blowing. Mr. Ehrlich is a lyricist who rarely expresses skepticism in his playing, never uses cliches and usually keeps his solos incandescent.

Backed by Michael Formanek on bass and Bobby Previte on drums, Mr. Ehrlich and Mr. Strickland stretched out. Mr. Previte regularly changed textures, using rim shots to count off the time, or thumping his floor tom. By the time the set was over, the band had created a real feeling of group improvisation, swinging and joyous and never simple.

The saxophonist George Cartwright, the bassist Mark Dresser and the drummer Kevin Norton came out next and performed a set of free improvisations that often sounded planned. Mr. Cartwright, when he played tenor saxophone, used a fat and lazy tone, as if he had spent most of his time in bed. During his solos, Mr. Norton moved through jazz drum styles, quoting from Max Roach and Elvin Jones and others, and at its best the group had a real tension to it, where the improvisations unfolded like chapters in a particularly good book.
