PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 31—A special squad of 100 patrolmen this afternoon raided the headquarters of an apostate from the Black Muslims who now leads a cult of his own in the Negro district of North Philadelphia.

The police said they had found a .22‐caliber pistol, two bayonets and the ingredients for a dozen Molotov cocktails. Two of the Molotov cocktails had been assembled.

The former Black Muslim, who calls himself Shaykh Muhammad, was arrested.

The only other persons in the three‐story building when the police arrived were his wife and children.

The police said the unusually large detachment of patrolmen had been used because they had had no way of knowing how many members of the cult might be inside the building, which is on Columbia Avenue in the heart of the section where rioting flared Friday night.
