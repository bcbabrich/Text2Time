JERUSALEM, (Israeli Sector), Nov. 30—A 40-year‐old Israeli businessman has been arrested on suspicion of having spied for the United Arab Republic.

Samuel Baruch was seized last week in Haifa as he was about to sail for Italy aboard the Israeli car ferry Bilu. The police, who had kept Mr. Baruch under surveillance for a year, said compromising documents had been found in his possession.

Mr. Baruch was born in Jerusalem but had lived in Britain from boyhood until he returned to Israel a few years ago.

Mr. Baruch founded Argadin, Ltd., a textile plant in the industrial town of Kiryat Gat. The company ran into financial difficulties and went into bankruptcy about a year ago.
