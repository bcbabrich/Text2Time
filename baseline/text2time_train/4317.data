With property insurance companies facing worse-than-expected claims from the California earthquake, the industry is signaling homeowners that they can expect higher premiums, tougher guidelines on what will be insured and fewer companies offering earthquake policies.

Steve Young, director of a trade group representing insurance agents and brokers, said the desire of insurance companies to limit their exposure to future earthquake losses was "a crisis in the making for California insurance consumers." In the months since the January earthquake, more and more California property owners have been trying to buy earthquake insurance.

So far, only one company -- Twentieth Century Insurance, the eighth- largest home insurer in the state -- has applied to the state for an emergency rate increase. The company wants to double or triple the cost of earthquake insurance to $4 or $6 per $1,000 of coverage, up from $2 currently, while maintaining a a deductible that requires homeowners to pay for damages up to 10 percent of the insured value of property. Loss Exceeds Estimate

Richard A. Dinon, senior vice president at Twentieth Century, noted that its earthquake claims totaled about $600 million, or more than four times what it estimated its maximum loss could be from a huge quake. After losing nearly half its capital, which serves as a cushion to absorb unexpected losses, Twentieth Century says it needs higher prices to accumulate profits so that it can pay claims from the next major earthquake.
