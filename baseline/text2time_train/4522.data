The strategy Gary Kasparov used against Nigel Short in Game 11 of their world championship match yesterday in London was to pit an advantage in mobility and space against one of material. But Short defended obstinately and brought the game to a draw by exchanging off everything that might do him harm.

The score is now 8 to 3 in Kasparov's favor, and he is inching steadily toward the 12 1/2 points that will give him the $1.43 million winner's share of the $2.55 million prize in the 24-game series.

At the end of yesterday's game, Short was still two pawns ahead, but they would have been permanently blocked and hence nonfunctional. Kasparov had earlier sacrificed them to ruin the mobility of the black pawns and pieces, but he did not succeed in showing that he had more than equality. Short's oranges proved equivalent to Kasparov's apples. The black array may have looked awfully disheveled, but it wouldn't go away and that was what mattered.

Kasparov switched from his usual Ruy Lopez to the Scotch Opening with 3 d4 ed 4 Nd4 for this game. It was no surprise for Short since the Russian was the one who got this method of play out of mothballs three years ago in his title defense against Anatoly Karpov in New York and Lyons, France. Kasparov succeeded in demonstrating that the strategy of knocking out the black center pawn early on was neither as simple nor as primitive as had long been believed. A Rare Choice by Kasparov
