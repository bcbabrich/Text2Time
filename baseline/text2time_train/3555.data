Deutsch Inc. in New York is joining the agency roster of Procter & Gamble, the world's largest advertiser.

Deutsch has been named agency of record for Reflect.com, the Internet company formed in September by P.& G. and two venture capital funds, Institutional Venture Partners and Redpoint Ventures. Deutsch will create advertising for Reflect.com, a Web site (www.reflect.com) that will sell customized women's beauty products and services.

Gretchen Briscoe, a spokeswoman for P.& G. in Cincinnati, said the decision came after a review that included agencies on and off the company's agency roster; she declined to identify the other participants. Denis Beausejour, vice president for global marketing at P.& G. and the Reflect.com project leader, praised the ''entrepreneurial spirit'' of Deutsch as well as its ''creative and strategic skills.''

Deutsch joins two other agencies working for Reflect.com: Rapp Collins Worldwide in New York, part of Omnicom Group, for direct marketing, and Critical Mass in Calgary, Alberta, 50 percent owned by Rapp Collins, the interactive agency of record.
