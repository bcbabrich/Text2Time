But after he heard the testimony of SUNY's chancellor, Robert King, at the committee hearing in New York City on Tuesday, Mr. Canestrari said, he doubted that SUNY would deliver such material before the governor issued his next executive budget, for the 2004-05 fiscal year.

''These are public dollars, and legislators have a right to know how they will be spent,'' Mr. Canestrari said, explaining why he and other legislators wanted more information. ''I don't know why SUNY won't provide it. They have done it before. It is not as if we are reinventing the wheel.''

David Henahan, a SUNY spokesman, said that five years ago, SUNY assessed each campus's critical maintenance needs before assembling a five-year capital request. This time, he said, the university had planned to allocate money based on the size in square feet ''to provide the campuses with maximum flexibility.''

If SUNY was loath to be more specific, CUNY faculty members, students and administrators turned out in force at the Assembly hearing last week to make the case for how capital ought to be spent at their university.

Some of the most devastating testimony came from the chairwoman of the biology department at the City College of New York, Jane Gallagher, who said the college's Marshak science building had deteriorated to the point of crisis. She said that people fainted from leaking fumes in the building and had to be carried out on stretchers, and that black dust showered on people from air ducts.

''We have been inundated in water from broken pipes to the point where we have had waterfalls going down the fire stairs from the 13th floor to the basement,'' Ms. Gallagher said. ''Every time it rains outside, water seeps from the external balconies into the labs on the corners of the building. Some of the labs have growths of species of fungi known to be harmful to human health. We have been unsuccessful in eradicating these fungi.''

Barbara Bowen, president of CUNY's faculty and staff union, the Professional Staff Congress, said many CUNY colleges had poor conditions, including falling concrete, elevators that do not reach all floors and crowding that results when 18,000 students are squeezed into space designed for 7,000.
