One of the saddest spectacles of the Eighties was the Reagan and Bush Administrations' systematic assault on both the effectiveness and the principles of the Justice Department. A first step must be to restore the pride and vitality of the Civil Rights Division, which had a strong bipartisan tradition as a beacon of orderly social change under Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford and Carter.

To accomplish this, the Nineties must begin with a return to another bipartisan tradition, that of having the Attorney General as chief arbiter of legal policy in the Government. Mr. Bush allowed his undistinguished Attorneys General to be shoved aside by C. Boyden Gray, his strong-willed White House counsel whose outdated antipathy to civil rights contributed to historic levels of mistrust between the White House and minorities. It is time to release the pent-up energy of career employees ready to straighten up a department thrown into disarray under Presidents Reagan and Bush. Homelessness

Throughout the Eighties it was possible to look from the windows of the White House family quarters and see a tableau of urban despair: the homeless people in Lafayette Park. Once the stands erected for the inaugural parade are dismantled, they will be back, and the Clintons will be able to watch them if they have the stomach for it.

Mr. Bush was a chief executive who could observe Lafayette Park and come up with nothing more forceful than "a thousand points of light." Will Mr. Clinton be a President who looks from the same windows and says to himself: "I am leader of the richest and most powerful nation on earth, and I choose to use some of that wealth and power to relieve this suffering. I may not be able to fix this overnight. But I have the resources to make a start, and I will"?

If he fails to see what is going on in Lafayette Park, will Hillary Clinton be the kind of First Lady who takes him to those windows and reminds him that Presidents can make a difference to the most vulnerable of us? If the answer to either of those questions is yes, the Nineties will be a better decade in every American city. Values

For this to be a healthy decade for America's political culture, we do need a return to traditional values -- as those values existed before the distorting effects of the 1988 and 1992 campaigns. These are the values of community and compassion that flowed from the New Deal and once animated the political life of both parties.

Starting with the George Wallace campaigns in the Sixties, the bottom feeders in the political strategy business learned that they could win votes by redefining values in a crabbed, divisive and hateful way. Some of Mr. Bush's hired hands, the late Lee Atwater and the rancorous Roger Ailes, carried out this work with a cold-blooded genius that was impressive but never admirable. In the year just ended, the final insult to language and political sense could be observed in the vacuous sallies of Vice President Dan Quayle and the venomous ones of Patrick Buchanan.
