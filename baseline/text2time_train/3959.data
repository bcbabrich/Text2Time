An 11-year-old boy went on a shooting and robbery rampage on Tuesday before wounding a security guard who then held the boy for the police, the authorities said.

The boy left school with his mother earlier in the day, telling nurses that he did not feel well. Once home, he shaved his head, put on a ski mask and a monk's robe and set out with his father's rifle, the police said.

The security guard, Lawrence Misa, 27, was shot in the hand when he tried to grab the rifle outside a hair salon that the boy had robbed, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported on Wednesday. He then held the boy until the police arrived.

The boy, a sixth grader whose name was not released, is scheduled to be arraigned on Friday morning

He first approached a group of cable workers, who thought he was pulling a prank until he fired two shots at them. The boy, who stands 4 feel tall and weighs 50 pounds, then approached two joggers, demanded money and fired into the air, said a police spokesman, Bill Robinson. Minutes later, he walked into a beauty shop, fired a shot into the ceiling and demanded money.
