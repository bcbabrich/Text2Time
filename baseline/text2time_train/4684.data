Rather than lock themselves into a five-year, $9.4 million deal for a player who would very likely never be more than their backup power forward and who insisted that he didn't want to play for them, the New Jersey Nets yesterday refused to match the contract offer the Detroit Pistons made to Terry Mills.

Willis Reed, the Nets' senior vice president, said that relinquishing the rights to Mills was a "basketball decision," but it was one that left him with no suitable reserve for Derrick Coleman, the team's best player. Coleman missed 17 games last season, mostly as a result of ankle sprains.

Acknowledging that a hole now existed in what was a young, improving eight-man rotation, Reed said, "We're going to have to go out and get another player."

He added, though, that re-signing the team's remaining restricted free agent, starting small forward Chris Morris, was his first priority. At the same time, the Nets have Mills's $875,000 slot from last season within the salary cap with which to replace him.
