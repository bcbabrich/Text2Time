"What you can't do," he said, "is offer explicit evidence that you will engage in homosexual acts."

Mr. McGuire said the ruling could have a great effect on the Clinton policy. "The question is, Will the new policy still be constitutional, given the reasoning in this decision," he said. "This decision says it is improper for the Government to make a presumption that a person who says he or she is gay will conduct himself or herself in prohibited conduct. That presumption is the linchpin for the Clinton Administration policy."

The author of today's opinion was Judge Pamela Ann Rymer, an appointee of President George Bush. Joining her in the unanimous ruling were Judge Otto R. Skopil Jr., who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter, and Judge David R. Thompson, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan.

The Justice Department has vigorously defended the Government's position in cases involving the old regulations, which explicitly barred service by homosexuals, because in some ways they are similar to the new rules, which were adopted in December and went into effect in February.

The new policy, a compromise that evolved after Mr. Clinton vowed to lift unconditionally the military ban on homosexuals but met stiff resistance from the Pentagon and Congress, allows homosexuals to serve and ends a longstanding practice of asking new recruits their sexual orientation and aggressively pursuing investigations of those suspected of being gay.

But the Clinton Administration policy, while it seeks to distinguish between conduct and orientation, seems to continue the old practice of discharging those who declare themselves to be gay, as in the cases of Mr. Meinhold and Mr. Steffan.

Any officer of the rank of major or higher can embark on an investigation leading to discharge proceedings against someone for a homosexual act, a homosexual marriage or a homosexual statement "demonstrating a propensity or intent to engage in a homosexual act."

And the one court challenge so far filed under the new rules, in Federal court in Brooklyn, involves six plaintiffs from different branches of service who contend that their only offense was in declaring themselves homosexuals. The Justice Department will file a brief in that case on Friday, which will be the Government's first official defense of the Clinton policy.
