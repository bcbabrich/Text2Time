April is the cruelest month? Ha! T. S. Eliot obviously never spent August searching for a good movie. The last weeks of summer are the traditional dumping ground for films too weak to go up against midsummer blockbusters. But there are always exceptions, and this August brought two of the season's smartest, most stylish, most entertaining movies. "Desperado" and "The Usual Suspects" both have hunky heroes, mazelike plots and slick action: the perfect formula for escapist, dog-day pictures.

"Desperado" owes its flair in equal measure to the director, Robert Rodriguez, and the star, Antonio Banderas. Though the story is a virtual remake of Mr. Rodriguez' done-for-a-pittance "El Mariachi," this story of a violent, guitar-playing seeker of justice gains a whole different twist with Mr. Banderas in the title role. He plays up his Latin-lover appeal with flowing hair and what another era would have called bedroom eyes. But "Desperado" shows him to be an actor whose mind is in the right place, too.

This is a film that pays homage to the old ultra-violent shoot-'em-up genre, even as it wallows in "Wild Bunch" gunfights, and Mr. Banderas has the wit to make this semi-serious attitude work. In one especially wry scene, the hero's lover serenades him while he calmly and comically points his guns at the villains creeping outside their bedroom windows. Though "Desperado" may seem like one more entry in the Tarantino school of smart-guy crime movies, Mr. Rodriguez's swift visual style is distinctively his.

"The Usual Suspects," directed by Bryan Singer, also pays homage to caper movies while becoming a sleek addition to the genre. The twisty plot practically defies understanding. It has something to do with stealing $91 million worth of cocaine from a ship, and is just lucid enough to keep viewers trailing along after it, which is half the fun. The other half is watching a handful of first-rate actors, who keep the audience guessing what blunders and doublecrosses they have in mind.
