FRIDAY’S PUZZLE — Have you ever filled in an entry with little or no idea what it meant?

I enjoyed Scott Atkinson’s Friday offering very much, but set a further challenge for myself today by doing the puzzle mostly from the Across clues. It’s a good thing, too, because it got me 1 Down. Even so, I had no idea what it meant. Never having heard the phrase “KATIE BAR THE DOOR,” I parsed the phrase incorrectly in every possible way except the correct one. Finally, just as I was about to bow down to the Google gods, it hit me (the phrase, not the door). That’s one I will not forget.

Crossing Katie is ETERNAL OPTIMIST, which I thought looked beautiful in the grid, didn’t you? I also liked MOONLIGHT SONATA amongst the long entries.

In the Wordplay Department, “Chihuahua scratch?” is a brilliant clue for PESO, and the same goes for “It has a sticking point” for HYPO.

I usually get a lot of questions when a clue like this comes up, so I will give 60 Down away right here: MNO are the three letters on the number 6 button on your phone. No, I don’t mind if you check. I’ll wait right here. See? You’re welcome.

Also from the “Are You Sure?” Department: The “Center of cat-tails” is O’NINE because … well, I’ll just let you look that one up yourself. And finally, yes, NONCONTIGUOUSLY (in this puzzle, at least) means that none of the black squares are touching each other.

Happy 100th birthday to the crossword cookie, the OREO. I bought a package of the special edition Birthday Cake Oreos and even though I am not a huge fan of the regular ones, these are awesome. The creme is much sweeter and is probably flavored to taste like frosting. They are a big hit in my house, let me tell you, and there will be a showdown over the last cookie. Katie bar the door!

And now, your Beethoven moment:
