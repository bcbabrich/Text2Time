The Elan Corporation, the troubled Irish drug maker, will seek new buyers for two drugs that it agreed to sell to King Pharmaceuticals of Bristol, Tenn., in January for $850 million if litigation significantly delays the King transaction, Elan executives said today.

Three months ago, Elan, based in Dublin, heralded that sale as the deal that would save the company from a mountain of debt. The company's market value was the largest in Ireland in 2000 but has crashed in the last year, in large part because of concerns about accounting practices. An inquiry by the United States Federal Trade Commission into the way Elan has promoted one of the two drugs prompted King to say it was backing out of the deal, and Elan responded by suing King in New York to force completion of the sale.

Elan's overall business is struggling. Today, the company reported a loss of $130.2 million for the first quarter, down from a $50 million profit in the quarter last year. But doubts over the sale of the two drugs are the biggest problem now.

''The King issue is more than just a transaction issue,'' said G. Kelly Martin, Elan's chief executive, in a telephone interview today. ''It's about reputation, and ability to execute the recovery plan, and that's potentially more serious than the transaction itself.''
