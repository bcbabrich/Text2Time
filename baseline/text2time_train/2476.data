Gary Mount, a 10th-generation farmer in central New Jersey who owns Terhune Orchards, has an irrigation system and estimated he used 50 percent more water than average this year, growing 35 crops on 200 acres in Princeton. His farm stand on Cold Soil Road features pick-your-own raspberries, apple cider slush, a separate section for children to ride toy tractors, and a staff wearing red T-shirts proclaiming "Apple Corps."

He was glad to have an irrigation system powered by electricity instead of costly diesel. In 2002, the state's Department of Agriculture found that 2,124 farms out of 9,924 were irrigated. With irrigation, many New Jersey farmers are able to withstand droughts, if power and water remain affordable. "Every single one of them would tell you they'd rather add water than subtract it," Mr. Mount said, noting that wet seasons brought pests and diseases.

New Jersey farmers, especially those who sell their produce wholesale rather than at produce stands or farmers' markets, have a tough time, Mr. Mount said. "Everything we put in is more expensive -- land, labor, supplies," he said, adding that New Jersey had one of the highest farmland tax rates in the country. "It makes for a higher cost, but prices are determined on a national level."

Ed Gaventa, 44, farms about 200 acres in Logan Township in Gloucester County. His farm lost most of its 20-acre pumpkin harvest because of the heat. He would usually harvest 200 bins, selling at $100 each on the wholesale market, but is ending up with seven bins, which he will try to sell at retail, expecting to make $1,000 at best, or $19,000 less than he had anticipated. "In our business, we can't set a price," he said. "We're at the mercy of what the market is going to give us."

Most of Connecticut received an inch and an half less rain than average this growing season, said Erica Fearn, executive director of the state's Farm Bureau. In the New London area, which has been extremely dry, some silage corn has been harvested early because of the weather.

The growing season in New York was also very dry, said Peter Gregg, a spokesman for the New York Farm Bureau, a volunteer group. "Yields were down in a lot of cases because of the lack of rainfall," he said, "but the quality of fruits was extremely good because of all the sunshine." Expect very sweet apples this year, he said.

The weather created other problems, including heat damage from watering hot crops, premature aging of plants and poor melon and squash pollination by bees spending more energy keeping their hives cooled.
