A police car still sits in front of the house on Gladwin Avenue in Flushing, Queens, a reminder of the arson fire three months ago that turned this quiet street into a symbol of neighborhood resistance to the child-welfare policies of New York City.

The outrage that grew before and after the fire April 20 - which led to the arrests of five residents of the street - has subsided. But since July 14, when the first of the babies arrived at the small brick-and-frame house at 171-27 Gladwin Avenue, a sense of anxiety has persisted.

Child-care workers there say they have felt uncomfortable at times in their new surroundings.

Donna Wilson, a 25-year-old worker, said the mood on both sides had settled into one of ''wait and see.''

Yet those in the house also speak of small acts of kindness by their neighbors.

And from the patrol car car that guards the house 24-hours a day, an officer said the worst thing that happened was that the mosquitoes really begin biting around midnight.
