Mr. Frampton said he hoped that the appointment of F. Dale Robertson, who has been associate chief forester, to succeed Mr. Peterson as chief would create an opportunity for ''a new vision for our National Forests.''

''This vision should reflect the desires of the American people for unspoiled wilderness, clean water, wildlife and recreation,'' Mr. Frampton said. But he said he was not optimistic. 'Logging Less in the '80's'

Mr. Peterson rejects the contention that there has been too much logging on his watch. ''Because of the budget crunch our programs may be somewhat out of balance,'' he said. ''Some of our recreational facilities are seriously in need of rehabilitation and some streams have become clogged up. But contrary to opinion, we are logging less in the 80's than we were in the 70's.''

Contentions of excessive roadbuilding are also unfounded, Mr. Peterson says. He said that the number of miles of roads built in National Forests had gone down every year since he became chief and that many miles of logging road had been closed. As a result, he said, the forests now have 25 percent fewer miles of open road than when he became chief.

Mr. Peterson also says it is simply untrue that the Forest Service is rapidly punching roads into forests so as to make them unsuitable for future wilderness designation. ''That is not on our agenda,'' he said.

Ralph Max Peterson, ''Max'' to friend and foe alike, is 59 years old. He was born in Bennett, Mo., and was trained not as a forester but as a civil engineer. He later received a master's degree in water-resource and land-use planning from Harvard. 'Almost an Institution'

George S. Dunlop, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for natural resources and environment, said Mr. Peterson was ''almost an institution - he is a great leader who has the tremendous respect of everyone here.'' In part because of Mr. Peterson's leadership and the people he recruited, Mr. Dunlop said, ''the Forest Service is recognized as one of the premier if not the premier Federal agencies in esprit de corps and professionalism.''
