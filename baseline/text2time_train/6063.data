WASHINGTON, July I—With a major extension of service today, the capital's smooth‐running but financially and politically troubled subway system is finally getting a chance to show whether rapid rail transit can reshape and help revive the nation's ninth largest metropolis, as planners here have promised. The signs are mixed.

The Blue Line, a second undergroundand‐elevated route of Washington's Metro system, opened for Business this morning.The new 12‐mile connects the largely black, extreme eastern section of the city with downtown, the Pentagon and the nearby Virginia suburbs, terminating for now at Washington National Airport. The “second stage” Metro addition more than triples the system's in‐service mileage, to 17 miles, serving 24 stations.

Patronage on the Red Line, an intersecting five‐mile demonstration route that inaugurated subway service here last July, has far exceeded estimates of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, the agency that operates the District's transit system. And, despite rash of opening day breakdowns today, forecasts for Blue Line patronage are significantly higher, based in part on commuter necessity.

• Hundreds of incoming suburban bus lines, also operated by the transit authoritie, are to be “turned back” over the next few months at the most outlying Metro ‘stations, forcing transit patrons going to the central city into the subway. Inbound, they will pay both a bus and a subway fare. Outbound, the transit agency began offering free transfers today for use at Metro‐bus connecting points. And the basic bus fare went up from 40 cents to 50 cents.
