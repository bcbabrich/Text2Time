In many respects, Drexel appears to have made a pretty good deal for itself. In the first place, it is expected that the firm will not be criminally charged with trading on inside information, the main offense in the civil complaint that the Securities and Exchange Commission filed against it in September. Also, no individuals at the firm are to be named in this settlement, although an indictment of Mr. Milken, and possibly others, is expected this month.

The investigations by the United States Attorney's office and the S.E.C. were generated by information from Ivan F. Boesky, the arbitrager who is now serving a prison sentence for securities fraud. The Government alleges that Drexel engaged in illegal insider trading, ''parked'' stock to conceal the owners' identities and manipulated stock prices in transactions involving takeovers.

By agreeing to the settlement, which does not include some of the most serious allegations, Drexel will avoid a revealing examination of its practices in court. If the firm had fought and lost a criminal trial, Prof. Harvey J. Goldschmid of the Columbia University Law School pointed out, it would have been exposed to ''far greater civil liability and potential financial disaster.''

Also, the firm escaped charges under the 1970 Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which Mr. Giuliani's office had threatened to use. The mere filing of racketeering charges would have allowed the Government to freeze Drexel's assets and made it virtually impossible for the firm to conduct business. Just as important, such a step would have prevented Drexel's 1,700 employee shareholders, who own most of its stock, from taking their equity out of the firm.

Further, the $650 million penalty - a $300 million fine plus $350 million to be set aside as a reserve fund to settle claims by investors and clients - is relatively small compared with the fees the firm has been reaping from its investment banking and underwriting activities. Drexel, which has $2.3 billion in capital, is expected to receive $230 million for its work on the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout, for instance. And some of the fine is expected to be tax-deductible. If the firm continues to generate those kinds of fees, the fine will have been money well spent to stay in business.
