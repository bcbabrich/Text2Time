More than a month after signing a letter of intent to acquire the Islanders, Bob Gutkowski's $180 million bid to buy the team is moving slowly, with no certainty of success.

Gutkowski's group must satisfy the Islanders' owners, Howard and Edward Milstein, and Steven Gluckstern, that it possesses sufficient financing to complete the purchase. It must also satisfy the demands of John Pickett, the former Islanders owner, who is owed tens of millions of dollars in deferred payments. Paying off Pickett may require a restructuring of his deal.

''I've been talking to the Gutkowski group and the stumbling block is the due diligence it's doing on the team and deciding whether to go ahead or not,'' said Mort Certilman, Nassau County's chief negotiator with the team for a new arena to replace Nassau Coliseum.

Gutkowski declined to comment.

The due diligence involves examining the finances and operations of the franchise, which lost $20 million last season, to assess its worth. After the process, the agreed-upon sale price could be adjusted up or down. RICHARD SANDOMIR
