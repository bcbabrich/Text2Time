Baron Marcel Bich, whose inexpensive Bic disposable pens, lighters and razors made him wealthy enough to sustain an 11-year quest for the America's Cup, died on Monday in Paris. He was 79 and lived in suburban Neuilly-sur-Seine.

After fixing up a leaky shed in Clichy, a northern Paris suburb, after World War II, Baron Bich and a partner, Edouard Buffard, began turning out inexpensive penholders and pencil cases. Later he obtained the patent rights to a ball-point pen invented by a Hungarian, Ladislas Biro, and formed Societe Bic in 1953. (The baron's name and the pen's are pronounced beek in French.)

The inexpensive pens proved irresistible to consumers, beginning with the French. The corporation rapidly expanded, with factories in many countries turning out billions of pens sold singly or by the carton. Later he produced disposable razors and lighters. Annual Sales of $1.1 Billion

In 1993 the Bic group reported worldwide sales of $1.1 billion and a profit of $70.5 million. In the United States, the French parent is represented by the Bic Corporation, based in Milford, Conn., and listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Societe Bic also owns the French fashion and perfume house Guy Laroche, the stocking company Dim and the lingerie maker Rosy.
