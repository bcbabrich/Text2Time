Doctors have known for years that giving patients a quick dose of antibiotics shortly before the first surgical incision is made will reduce the risk of infection.

But a new study that looked at more than 2,900 hospitals has found that this is done only about half the time. The study, led by Dr. Dale W. Bratzler of the Oklahoma Foundation for Medical Quality, appears in the current Archives of Surgery.

More than 2 percent of the 30 million operations performed each year lead to infection, the researchers say. Infections lead to higher death rates, longer hospital stays and bigger bills.

Hospitals do, in fact, give most patients antibiotics before surgery, the study said. But the drugs are often wrong, the researchers found, and, more important, so is the timing. Most experts say the drugs should be given within an hour of surgery, so they do not wear off.
