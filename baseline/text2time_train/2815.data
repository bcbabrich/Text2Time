James Blake got his standing ovation last night at Arthur Ashe Stadium. He did not get his upset of Roger Federer, the Wimbledon champion.

The ovation came when Blake held serve after weathering 8 break points, 10 deuces and a great deal of Federer brilliance. It was a remarkable effort, and the fans knew what Blake had accomplished as they roared and roared.

The rub was that it was only the third game of the second set. Federer can make even straightforward tasks appear difficult for his opponents. And the pressure he applied nearly from the start of this well-attended match at the United States Open eventually wore down Blake, the quick and eager American.

Blake played well -- superbly at times -- but Federer won this third-round match, 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3.
