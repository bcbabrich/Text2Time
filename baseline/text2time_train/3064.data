But Mr. Bush's target audience extends well beyond the people in any given meeting.

''What Bush is doing is aimed as much at white people as black people,'' said David Bositis, an analyst of minority voting at the Joint Center for Economic Studies. ''Bush is conservative, more conservative than the American public. By doing the things he's doing, he makes himself appear more moderate.''

Mr. Bush opened the meeting with the black caucus, all Democrats, by saying he wanted to discuss his education proposals, some of which are intended to bring greater accountability to schools in poor urban areas. ''While there may be some discussion about details,'' Mr. Bush said, ''all of us, surely, believe the great hope for this country is to make sure every child -- I mean every child -- is educated.''

The conversation turned quickly to a topic that is especially sensitive to Mr. Bush: the dispute over counting the votes, many of them in predominantly black areas, in Florida in the presidential election.

Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, said before the hourlong White House meeting: ''There's nothing more painful for blacks than our struggle for the right to vote. We're not getting over the pain we have from Florida.''

Mr. Bush was ready to discuss the issue. Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said before the meeting that the president believed there were numerous problems that the election highlighted beyond black voting, including difficulties with absentee ballots from overseas military personnel and news projections of the winners before the close of voting.

Chief among the 20 or so issues that arose at the meeting today was Mr. Bush's nomination of John Ashcroft, an outspoken conservative, as attorney general, an appointment vehemently opposed by many black political leaders and organizations.

''That was the first thing that came up,'' said Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan. ''We explained to him why we couldn't buy Ashcroft in 100 years.''
