THE Mets needed this miracle.

Silly as it may sound on one night of a 162-game season, the Mets made a major claim on posterity.

The Mets were down, 8-1, going into the bottom of the eighth inning last night at Shea Stadium. The Braves were on the verge of taking the Mets' heart. They had already trounced them on Thursday, and now they were moving in for the kill. Atlanta manhandled Mike Hampton, the multimillion-dollar pitcher whose sole purpose in baseball life was to carry the Mets over the top. Melvin Mora, the rock-solid everything player, made an error last night and Mike Piazza made his second in three days.

More than that, Atlanta was toying with the Mets. The Atlanta players were on the bench laughing and guffawing, sitting on the top step of the dugout, backs turned to the Mets as if the game were over.

Then came the eighth inning, when the Mets loaded the bases with two out. In a fitting turnabout for a team that was eliminated from the National League Championship Series by Atlanta on a bases-loaded walk, the Mets scored three runs on three consecutive walks. They tied the game, 8-8, on a two-run single by Edgardo Alfonzo and then finally won it on a three-run homer by Piazza.
