Transit officials have no firm figures on the number of homeless living in the tunnels, but say they have found several hundred furnished rooms, some complete with running water, electricity, furniture and such conveniences as televisions, within the labyrinthine New York City subway system.

The transit police fear that the homeless are increasingly risking death to have such a space for their own. ''They all want their own little piece of turf,'' Sgt. John Greco, head of the Homeless Outreach Program, said. ''It is definitely getting much worse.''

A spokesman for the transit police, Albert W. O'Leary, said that he sympathized with the homeless but that the perils of tunnel life forced them to be removed. ''Being homeless is not against the law, but being homeless in a tunnel is very dangerous,'' he said. Two Dozen Killed Each Year

About two dozen people - excluding suicides - are killed by trains or by the rails in the tunnels each year, and a ''significant number'' of those are homeless, he said.

Last month, according to a police report, Linda Howe, a homeless woman looking for a private place to go to the bathroom, walked off the Lexington Avenue and 23d Street platform and into the tunnel. Commuters screamed warnings to her and then watched in horror as she was crushed to death by an uptown No. 4 train.

Mark White, 29, who has lived in the Lafayette Street Station tunnel for almost two months, said two friends had been hit by trains, one fatally.

''He was my good drinking buddy,'' Mr. White said of a friend he identified only as Richard, who was killed by a subway car in October.
