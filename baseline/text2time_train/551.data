For social-science nerds, Mr. Lewis provides the back story to Dr. Kahneman and Dr. Tversky’s most famous papers. But the real drama of “The Undoing Project” — the scenes on the peak-end highlight reel — revolve around Dr. Tversky and Dr. Kahneman, both as individuals and as a creative pair.

The two men really couldn’t have been more different. True, they were both Israelis, and both saw war; they also shared a contrarian sensibility. But Dr. Kahneman arrived in Jerusalem as a shy adolescent, a refugee from France, where he’d barely survived the Nazis; Dr. Tversky was a “swaggering Sabra,” or native of Israel. Dr. Kahneman, particularly in the beginning of his career, was pessimistic, moody and profoundly insecure (“like Woody Allen, without the humor,” declares a colleague; oof). Dr. Tversky was a boffo extrovert, practically leaking self-confidence. He was also the more conspicuously dazzling to talk to. His mind was like a cow’s stomach, capable of digesting many things at once.

Yet somehow, starting in 1969, an intellectual romance bloomed between these two professors of psychology. They finished each other’s sentences and shared their own shorthand. They wrote side by side at the same typewriter. (“I cannot imagine,” the psychologist Richard Nisbett tells Mr. Lewis. “It would be like having someone else brush my teeth for me.”) In 1975, when Dr. Kahneman received a package from Dr. Tversky that he thought didn’t contain a personal note, he was crushed. Then he realized he was mistaken — there was a note there after all. “I saw the words ‘Yours, as ever’ and I had goose bumps from emotion,” he wrote in his reply.

But, like so many romances, it was fragile — and ultimately painful. As often happens in collaborations, one person, fairly or unfairly wound up getting more credit for the work, and in this case, it was Dr. Tversky. For Dr. Kahneman, this imbalance generated terrible tension and envy. That we know the details of such a close relationship, and its rocky emotional topography, is astonishing. Dr. Kahneman, 82, now at Princeton, seldom speaks to writers. But Mr. Lewis, as we know, is no ordinary author. While Dr. Kahneman started this project as a leery participant (see the acknowledgments), he clearly softened as time went along.

And what do we learn? That envy really is corrosive. That successful marriages involve, as the psychologist Marcel Zentner discovered, “positive illusions.” That world-famous psychologists can be blind to the needs of those around them. And that even winning a Nobel doesn’t guarantee self-esteem. Late in life, Dr. Kahneman remained a rattling kettle of self-doubt.

In a remarkable note on his sources, Mr. Lewis reveals that for years he watched Dr. Kahneman agonize over his 2011 book, “Thinking, Fast and Slow,” which became both a critical and a fan favorite. “Every few months he’d be consumed with despair, and announce that he was giving up writing altogether — before he destroyed his own reputation,” Mr. Lewis writes. “To forestall his book’s publication he paid a friend to find people who might convince him not to publish it.”

Dr. Tversky never fully understood these fits of doubt. Nor did he see how he made them worse. “I needed to get away,” Dr. Kahneman said. “He possessed my mind.”

Love. It’s the least rational feeling of all.
