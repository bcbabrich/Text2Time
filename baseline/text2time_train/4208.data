Skip the standings, the wild-card shuffling, the Buck-passing. If you want to understand the kind of season the Yankees and I have been having, wrap your bat around this: No one ever smiles when I pull out my pinstriped Visa card with the red, white and blue Yankee logo. I ordered it in April, when I decided to become a born-again Bronx Bomber fan, back when Don Mattingly had his beard, when Strawberry was out of season, when '94 still seemed like a promise. The card arrived in May and I've used it every chance I could; the closest I've ever come to that smile was the nod of a head-waiter in Lisbon. He recognized it, he said, because he was a Toronto Blue Jay fan.

The Visa card came with a come-on gift; two free tickets to any game (except the Opener and Old-Timers). I finally used the passes the day before yesterday, sunny and breezy, Jim Abbott for the Angels, Andy Pettitte for us. A perfect day for baseball.

"Nothing's perfect this season," said my designated companion for Yankee games, who calls himself Archie Armstrong at the Stadium. "When you follow a team, a winning team, you check in every night, see how they're doing. O.K., up by four, I can go out or go to sleep.

"But it's not like that with the Yankees this season. It's like a wayward child. Will he get home from school all right, back safely with the car? You worry all the time. Less time to worry about how much money you owe, the job you don't have."
