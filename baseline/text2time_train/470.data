WIMBLEDON, England — As Novak Djokovic and Sam Querrey headed back to their Wimbledon lodgings on Friday night, all the chatter about Djokovic’s Grand Slam was one set away from becoming a moot point.

Querrey, the No. 28 seed, took a 7-6 (6), 6-1 lead over Djokovic, the No. 1 seed, in their third-round match before rain forced the players off Court 1 shortly after 8 p.m.

Tournament officials later announced that play would not resume on Friday, which left Djokovic and Querrey with a great deal to think about overnight with their match scheduled to resume at noon on Saturday.

“It could be a sleepless night for both players, Sam thinking about the opportunity and Novak trying to find the solution,” said Jim Courier, the United States Davis Cup captain and a former world No. 1.
