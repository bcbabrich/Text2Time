Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist surveyed the state of the federal judiciary today and, in contrast to many of his 13 previous year-end reports, pronounced himself quite pleased.

The chief justice noted progress in three areas he had identified as problems in his report a year ago. At that time, all seven seats on the United States Sentencing Commission were vacant because of a political impasse between the White House and Congress. Now, the seats have been filled as a result of a compromise.

Last year, Congress had provided neither a raise nor a cost-of-living adjustment for federal judges. This fall, Congress approved a 3.4 percent cost-of-living adjustment, taking effect on Jan. 1, that will bring the annual salaries of federal district judges to $141,300; of judges on the courts of appeals to $149,900; of Supreme Court associate justices to $173,600; and of the chief justice to $181,400.

The judiciary was ''appreciative,'' Chief Justice Rehnquist said today, ''but it should not be confused with a raise in salary.''
