At B. Altman, the shades were drawn on the Fifth Avenue windows until Thursday night as carpenters set up six ''Christmas in America'' windows, depicting the same family celebrating the holiday during different periods of history. The display was such a success last year that it is being repeated.

''We built a log cabin that was as authentic as we could make it,'' said Andrew Druschilowsky, the display director. ''We were going to put a tree in the log cabin, but then we realized that they didn't have Christmas trees then.''

Most of the sets were constructed in the store's subbasement. But some of the animated figures and mechanical toys were made outside, like the Model-T Ford, which bounces, rattles and emits clouds of smoke as father cranks it up while grandfather and grandmother wave goodbye.

''Doing the Christmas windows is a special job for all of us,'' said Bill Zaharias, the head carpenter. ''When I go outside and see the happy faces looking in, I say, boy, we are part of making them happy.''

Hanukkah begins on Dec. 18 this year, the first of the three big holiday celebrations that come within a two- week period and turn Murray's Sturgeon Shop on Broadway and 89th Street into bedlam.

''We dread it because we don't need the business,'' said Arthur Cutler, one of the owners of the tiny 38-year-old delicatessen.''We end up not being able to give the service we like to give. When a customer calls about a big order, you'd like to say, 'We can't handle it,' but, of course, you don't.''

The big orders were already pouring in. Tacked to the wall in the back were that day's: 90 pounds of smoked salmon to be sent to Panama, several thousand dollars' worth of delicacies to go to Corpus Christi, Tex., a large order for someone in Miami.
