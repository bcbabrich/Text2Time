If Ranger fans were frustrated until 1994's Stanley Cup champions, remember that the Rangers won three cups in their early years. If Jets fans are frustrated now, remember Super Bowl III. If Knicks fans are frustrated now, remember the 1970 and 1973 National Basketball Association titles. If Yankee fans are to be frustrated now, remember 22 World Series triumphs.

Yes, Brooklyn had won the National League pennant in 1890, 1899 and 1900, but there wasn't any World Series in those years. When the Dodgers finally got to the Series in 1916, they lost to the Red Sox. In 1920, they lost to the Cleveland Indians before the five defeats by the Yankees. And when the 1955 Series moved to Ebbets Field for the third game, there wasn't much hope. Podres was starting only because the front office had been unable to contact another young left-hander, Ken Lehman, a 20-game winner at their Montreal farm team.

"About 10 days before the season ended we wanted to scratch Podres and bring in Lehman," the Dodgers' general manager then, Emil (Buzzy) Bavasi, said at the time. "But Lehman was driving home and we couldn't find him."

Bothered by a sore arm, Podres had a shaky 9-10 record, but Walt Alston, the Dodger manager, was desperate. Don Newcombe, his ace with a 20-5 record, had been battered in the opener, 6-5. Billy Loes didn't last four innings in a 4-2 loss to left-hander Tommy Byrne in Game 2. To add to the Dodgers' problem, Mickey Mantle's name was in New York's starting lineup for the first time since Sept. 16, when he pulled the hamstring muscle in his right thigh. But with a baffling changeup, Podres stopped the Yankees, 8-3, in Game 3.

"In the clubhouse," Podres recalled, "Alston told me, 'If there's a seventh game, you're my starter.' "

In the fourth game, homers by Duke Snider, Campanella and Hodges created an 8-5 victory that Clem Labine's curveball preserved. In the fifth game, a 25-year-old leftfielder, Edmundo (Sandy) Amoros, hit a homer and Snider hit two as Roger Craig and Labine combined on a six-hitter, 5-3, for a 3-2 Series lead.

"It'll be Newcombe or Spooner at the Stadium tomorrow," Alston said, "but Newk has had the flu to go with his sore arm and sore back."
