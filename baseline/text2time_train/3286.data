''I don't think it's enjoyable for anybody to sit out a four-hour game and watch both teams club each other to death,'' Cook said. ''It's not baseball.''

There were still five more runs to be scored, but when Ben Petrick flied out and the game finally ended, the Mets were left with two victories in three games and hearty batting averages throughout the order.

Alfonzo and Zeile both said they were starting to feel better at the plate before coming to Coors; playing in Denver, Zeile said, accentuates the feeling. Alfonzo had 10 hits in 13 at-bats in the three games, and Zeile was 8 for 15.

''Everything I hit was going through every hole,'' said Alfonzo, who had a home run, three singles and four runs batted in and improved his batting average 70 points this weekend.

Zeile's average also now sits above .300. He has tried to concentrate on hitting the ball up the middle or to the opposite field, and he was especially pleased that all three of his hits today went to right. Among those was Zeile's first home run, a two-run shot in the fourth off the former Met Brian Bohanon (0-3).

''I want to hit the ball where it's pitched,'' said Zeile, who pulled his three hits on Saturday. ''But for me to have the most success, my approach has to be the middle of the field or the right side.''

Zeile said playing in Coors Field gives a hitter extra confidence. But the Mets will not benefit from the thin air, the wide outfield gaps and the Rockies' flat breaking pitches the rest of this year: this was their only visit to Denver. Valentine is happy about that.
