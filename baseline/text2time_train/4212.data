Irony, a particularly gentle variety that by no means excludes compassion, is Mr. Bennett's element, and it is an anomaly in a country where audiences prefer their drama writ large and confessional and their comedy on the knee-slapping side. Even in his native England, Mr. Bennett is perceived as unusually oblique. He was certainly the quietest and most cryptic of the quartet of comedians that surfaced in the early 1960's with "Beyond the Fringe," the revue that also introduced Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Jonathan Miller.

And throughout his career as a playwright, actor and winningly apologetic cultural pundit, critics have tended to go through his works like beaters on a grouse hunt, trying to scare up clues to the author's real identity. (A reviewer of the 1980 play "Enjoy" seemed to find the writer in a character who spent his time on stage in drag, which, Mr. Bennett notes, "presupposes that I spend my evenings idly running my finger along a rack of strapless evening gowns and adjusting my slingbacks. Now it can be told.")

Readers of "Writing Home" may experience a similar sense of frustration. Mr. Bennett talks a fair amount about himself, but it is self as defined almost exclusively by self-consciousness, a free-floating, pained awareness of everything he isn't and of life as a minefield of potential embarrassments. His lower-middle-class childhood in Leeds was notable, he insists, only for its non-eventfulness; and characters in his plays who are "passive, dejected, at odds with themselves," are, he writes, "that old friend, the Writer in Disguise" (with or without slingbacks). Creating the secondary roles in his plays comes easily but the central character, he says, is usually "a blank, a puzzle, and one which I hope the actor will solve for me."

This, in fact, is a large part of Mr. Bennett's strength as a playwright: his unwillingess to reduce personality to explanatory psychology or social context, though he has a strong sense of both. Whether they are privileged schoolboys who grew up to betray their country; the timid, resentful shut-ins in the monologues in "Talking Heads"; a George III surprised by madness; a fame-shunning Franz Kakfa or even Queen Elizabeth II (in the second half of "Single Spies"), Mr. Bennett's people remain, to some degree, conundrums, above all to themselves.

This view of humanity also infuses the diary entries, one of which reads simply, "A man rooting in the dustbin stops suddenly and looks at his watch." The same quizzical, nonjudgmental gaze is focused, with fascinating results, on such well-known professional colleagues as John Gielgud and Lindsay Anderson, on a hilarious trip through the Soviet Union and, in invaluably informative accounts, on the surreal parallel universes created during theater and film productions.
