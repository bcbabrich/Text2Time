MOST people look at a lettuce and see salad. Designers look at a lettuce and see lettuce green.

''What would you think of that color on a chair?'' Richard Schultz, a furniture designer, asked, pointing to the bright floppy head sticking out of the ground in a vegetable garden fenced by tall wire tangled with wild purple roses. A chair in the garden is apple green, last month's flavor, which the designer chose by walking into a local paint store with an apple in his hand, picked from the tree behind his studio.

Mr. Schultz, 72, has spent the last 45 years getting to know his materials. As much as the metals and plastics that inspire innovation in furniture, they are the lettuces, leafy ferns, the light and shadow and lichened stone walls of the 49-acre, 19th-century farm he shares with his wife, Trudy.

Mr. Schultz is not a gardener. But he has cultivated the outdoors, planting designs in the landscape to see if visual relationships will grow.

The two small houses, barn, gardens and pond that sit within a circus of woods have been his laboratory for introducing man-made objects thoughtfully into the most fragile, temperamental of settings: nature.
