The entries in the Darwin Birthday Science Song Contest were so good that we named two winners. You can hear them both performed here at the Lab.

The winner in the Non-Darwin Division is “I’m a Genius,” written in the voice of Albert Einstein, who provides a witty and tuneful proof of his intellectual superiority to every other human. It’s by Ray Jessel, a veteran of Broadway and cabaret, who imagines Einstein surveying his historical rivals:

Two cheers for Rembrandt and Immanuel Kant

But me, I’m a genius!

Alexander the Great

Next to me is third rate,

Just like Paganini is!

There’s Igor Stravinsky, Nijinsky and Minsky –

And Homer, of course, gets a nod.

There’s Newton and Nietzsche

And Pavlov was peachy,

But me — I’m a god!

The Darwin Division winner, “Mr. Darwin, Mr. Wallace, Mr. Matthew,” tells how a smart — but publicity-naïve — Scottish tree expert failed to get credit for publishing the theory of natural selection more than two decades before Darwin did. It’s by David Haines, a British songwriter, who directs a choir singing it in the video you can see later in this post.

The winners were chosen out of more than 60 entries by Richard Milner, the subject of my Findings column and the performer of the one-man show, “Charles Darwin: Live and in Concert.” Here’s Mr. Milner’s assessment of the winning song by Mr. Haines along with some very useful history:

Evoking a maritime musical flavor of rolling waves, Mr. Haines chronicles the voyage of HMS Beagle, lovingly ticking off exotic place names that beckoned to young Darwin: Maldives, Tasmania, St. Helena, Galapagos. I was particularly charmed by his clever, historically accurate twist. Darwin fans know that a brilliant younger naturalist, Alfred Russel Wallace, was hot on our hero’s heels. Wallace conceived a theory of natural selection independently, during a bout of malaria in the jungles of Malaysia, spurring Darwin to complete his book in 13 months, a task that had eluded him for the previous 20 years. But Haines sings of yet another, unfamiliar claimant to the theory—a man named Patrick Matthew (1790-1894), whom virtually no one remembers. A Scottish tree expert, Matthew published a summary of natural selection 26 years before Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace’s joint papers of 1858–in a technical book, “On Naval Timber and Arboriculture,” where it went completely unnoticed. After “On the Origin of Species” (1859) shook the scientific world, Matthew protested that he had been first to publish the theory of natural selection. Amused at the man’s presumption, Darwin (who had spent decades gathering supporting data) admitted that he would be happy to “freely acknowledge that Mr. Matthew has anticipated [me] by many years.” But he added, “no one will feel surprised that neither I, nor apparently any other naturalist, has heard of Mr. Matthew’s views.” Later, Darwin found it delightfully ironic when an even earlier “discoverer” of natural selection came to light. A Scottish-American physician, William C. Wells (1757–1817) had set down a similar theory in an equally obscure essay, posthumously published in 1818. Upon learning of Wells in 1865, Darwin wrote to a friend, “So poor old Patrick Matthew is not the first, and he cannot, or ought not, any longer put on his title-pages `Discoverer of the Principle of Natural Selection.’” David Haines wisely ends with Matthew; an additional verse about Wells would certainly have overloaded and sank his Beagle song. The ever-gracious Alfred Russel Wallace, acknowledged by Darwin as his junior partner in the discovery of natural selection, opined that the credit should not go to the first person to whom an idea occurs, but to the first person “who convinces the world” of its truth. That, Wallace said modestly, he could never have done.

You can watch the video below of “Mr. Darwin” being sung by the North Cambridge Family Opera Festival Chorus. You can read the lyrics here.

At YouTube you’ll find a version of “Mr. Darwin” illustrated by an animated movie by Kyle Borlase.

You can find out more about the Darwin song and other science-related songs by Mr. Haines at Singtastic.com. Mr. Haines is a composer/writer based in the seaside town of Teignmouth, South Devon. For over twenty years, he has been working with youth and community music theater groups, schools, and colleges. He told me:

I write science songs the way other people write love songs – driven by passion. I usually know when I’ve written a good one because it makes me cry when I write it – the fact that I’m writing about the robustness of bacteria or the speciation of cichlids in the Great African Lakes makes no difference – I cry at the beauty of the science and at the fact that my song has managed (to my ear) to capture some element of that beauty.

The other winner, Mr. Jessel, was raised in Cardiff, Wales, and then Toronto, has been a longstanding mainstay of Hollywood and New York cabaret. Composer, lyricist, comedian, performer and pianist, he was a collaborator on “Baker Street,” a Broadway musical about Sherlock Holmes. Mr. Jessel’s songs have been sung by Dean Martin, Peggy Lee, and Louis Armstrong.

His “I’m a Genius” was judged by Mr. Milner to be “fanciful, erudite, outrageously witty, and, in my view, one of the most hilarious (ranking with Tom Lehrer’s classics “Werner von Braun” and “Lobachevsky”) songs about a scientist ever written.”

Congratulations to the winners. Thanks to all the entrants for a superb collection of songs, and to Mr. Milner for judging them. (You can watch a great video about Mr. Milner and see his performance of “Darwin’s Nightmare.”)

Any comments on the winning songs? Have we unfairly neglected anyone?
