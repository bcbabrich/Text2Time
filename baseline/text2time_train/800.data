ROSENTHAL--Nan, age 76, died peacefully at home on Sunday, April 27, 2014. Beloved wife of Henry B. Cortesi, she was born in New York City on August 27, 1937. She graduated from the Fieldston School, Sarah Lawrence College and earned a PhD from Harvard. She began her career in journalism but turned to the study of art history focusing on post-WWII American artists. She excelled as a scholar, curator, teacher, and mentor. Nan was Senior Consultant of 20th Century Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art until her retirement in 2008. Before moving back to New York after her marriage to Henry in 1991, she was curator of 20th Century Art at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and before that, a professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz. Over her long, varied and highly distinguished career, she accumulated a very large, diverse and devoted group of friends who enlivened and enriched her life as she did theirs. We are all deeply grieved and diminished by her death. A memorial for Nan will be held in September. In lieu of flowers, the family request that contributions be made in Nan's memory to the Financial Aid Fund of the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, 33 Central Park W. NY, NY 10023.
