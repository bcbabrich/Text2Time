Under the new Delaware law, a hostile bidder that acquires more than 15 percent of a target's stock cannot complete a takeover for three years. But the law allows the bidder to consummate the deal immediately if, in crossing the 15 percent threshold, it acquires in one fell swoop more than 85 percent of the outstanding stock. 2 New Bidders Affected This provision could make it significantly more difficult for the Campeau Corporation to succeed in its $4.2 billion hostile bid for Federated Department Stores Inc. and for the Black & Decker Corporation to execute its $1.8 billion unsolicited offer for American Standard Inc. Both Federated and American Standard are incorporated in the state, and Campeau has indicated it will challenge the validity of the new law in court.

The new law, which will become Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, will also permit shareholders to approve an unfriendly merger over the objections of management. Two-thirds of the shares voting, excluding shares held by the bidder, would have to consent in a special election.

The law is retroactive to last Dec. 23. Governor Castle said in an interview Friday that the date was picked by the Legislature to accommodate Texaco Inc., which has been embroiled in a struggle with its largest shareholder, Carl C. Icahn. Texaco is incorporated in Delaware and also has a major plant there.

On Dec. 23 Mr. Icahn held less than 15 percent of Texaco and executives feared he might bid for the company, especially if he succeeded in removing the anti-takeover provisions of Texaco's bylaws. But a Federal Bankruptcy Court last month dismissed his attempts at dismantling those provisions, and on Thursday Mr. Icahn said he controlled 14.8 percent of the outstanding stock. Aims of the Law

Governor Castle said the law was intended ''to curb leveraged financing and those abusive deals that result in the breakup of companies.''

''Companies and takeover artists have to learn that they have a certain responsibility to the community,'' he added.

Delaware has profited handsomely from its role as a major state for incorporations. Last year it derived about $156 million, or 16 percent of its revenue, from franchise taxes and fees associated with incorporation.
