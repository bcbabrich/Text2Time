There were no more rehearsals planned, no more status reports to be analyzed by the Mets' hierarchy. Regardless of how well or poorly he pitched today, this was Dwight Gooden's last stop on the road to recovery, a month spent shuttling to the minor leagues and back, preparing to join the 1987 season in progress.

And after having mixed results in his first four starts following treatment for cocaine use, Gooden found some of his old touch on a hot, sunny afternoon in a resort town where many people passed up a day at the shore to watch Gooden add to the heat with a blur of a fastball and curve that reminded some players of just how intimidating he can be.

''Today, I can say he's ready,'' said Greg Jelks, the Maine Guides' third baseman. ''He threw the ball better than he did against us the other night. His breaking ball was better. He was doing things today that I've seen him do on TV.'' Guides Held to One Hit

Gooden pitched six scoreless innings for the Tidewater Tides in the first game of a doubleheader, holding the Guides to one hit and earning a 1-0 victory. He walked three, hit one batter, struck out 10 and appeared to be getting stronger as the game progressed. He threw 100 pitches, 69 for strikes. Four of his strikeouts were on curveballs.
