“Slumdog Millionaire,” about a poor young man in the slums of Mumbai who competes on an Indian game show, can add another prize of its own to a growing list that includes recent honors from the Screen Actors Guild, the Golden Globes and the Producers Guild. On Saturday, the film’s director, Danny Boyle, was honored by the Directors Guild of America at the group’s 61st annual awards dinner. The other nominees for best feature film director were David Fincher (“The Curious Case of Benjamin Button”), Ron Howard (“Frost/Nixon”), Christopher Nolan (“The Dark Knight”) and Gus Van Sant (“Milk”). Most years, the guild’s feature film award portends a directing prize at the Academy Awards, set this year for Feb. 22.

Among the other winners on Saturday were Paul Feig in the television comedy category for an episode of “The Office” and Dan Attias for television drama for an episode of “The Wire.” “Waltz With Bashir,” Ari Folman’s animated documentary about Israeli soldiers recalling the 1982 war with Lebanon, won the documentary award, and the film critic Roger Ebert was honored with honorary life membership in the guild.

… “Slumdog” won another award over the weekend as well. On Friday, the film was honored at the 21st annual USC Libraries Scripter Awards at the University of Southern California’s Doheny Library. The Scripter goes to the author and the screenwriter of a book-to-film adaptation, and this time that meant Vikas Swarup, who wrote the novel, “Q&A,” on which “Slumdog is based, and Simon Beaufoy, who adapted it for the screen.
