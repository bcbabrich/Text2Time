CRAVE a backsplash of tarot-card tiles hand-painted in Spain? What about tiles depicting the zodiac instead, or heavenly bodies, polychrome teacups, a map of Britain and Ireland or the first manned balloon flight in 1783?

Paris Ceramics, founded in London in 1982 and famed for its restored 17th- and 18th-century limestone floors, also produces eye-popping ceramic tiles, including Pompeian mosaics and Victorian-style terrazzo. And though the company has catered to decorators and architects, its advertising has stimulated so many calls from homeowners that it decided to open the doors a bit wider, said Christopher Peacock, the president of Paris Ceramics USA. A 1,300-square-foot retail showroom is scheduled to open on Oct. 1 at the A & D Building, 150 East 58th Street, in Manhattan. But people who can't wait can take their checkbooks to Paris Ceramics' shop, at 31 East Elm Street, Greenwich, Conn.; (203) 862-9538. Prices are $12 to $30 a square foot.
