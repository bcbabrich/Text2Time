To the Editor:

Re ''A Turbulent Trade Meeting'' (editorial, Nov. 28): The World Trade Organization's anti-environmental rulings have gone far beyond only insisting that ''laws not discriminate against foreign suppliers.'' W.T.O. panels held to be illegal standards protecting sea turtles and dolphins from both foreign and domestic fishing fleets on the ground that the standards should not uniformly regulate the process of catching fish. The W.T.O. also disapproved a European ban on hormone-fed beef on scientific grounds.

If the W.T.O. discourages effective efforts to address major international and domestic environmental problems, in the long run it may undermine prosperity rather than promote it.
