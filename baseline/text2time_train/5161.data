CLASSICAL Copland: 'Appalachian Spring' Suite, 'Short Symphony' and Other Works Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. Deutsche Grammophon 427 335; CD and cassette. Copland originally wrote ''Appalachian Spring'' for 13 instruments, all that could fit in the pit for the 1944 premiere of the Martha Graham ballet - a version he suppressed once the suite for full orchestra caught on. With his concise and rhythmically exciting ''Short Symphony'' (1933) he did something of the reverse; since it proved too difficult for many orchestras, he made a sextet setting, which we are likelier to encounter. Here are variants on both originals - the ''Spring'' Suite in a chamber orchestration (the 13 instruments plus extra strings), the symphony in a chamber orchestra reduction devised by Dennis Russell Davies - along with chamber orchestra renditions of ''Quiet City'' and ''Three Latin American Sketches.'' Orpheus plays with verve if not an especially original point of view. In DG's recording, close and striking, the ''Short Symphony'' is a real grabber. - Mark Swed Richard Strauss: 'Aus Italien,' Four Orchestral Songs Felicity Lott, soprano (Songs); Scottish National Orchestra conducted by Neeme Jarvi. Chandos 8744; all three formats. Like Mendelssohn and Berlioz before and Elgar after him, Richard Strauss knew how to capture his glowing youthful Italian impressions in music. The designation ''Symphonic Fantasy'' fits the early ''Aus Italien'' (1886) well. Those who tend to dismiss it as a ''travelogue'' because of its symphonic elaboration of the familiar ''Funiculi, Funicula'' in the final movement are bound to overlook the subtleties and splendid colors of the preceding three - particularly the third movement (''On the Shores of Sorrento''), which points ahead to later Strauss. The performance, apparently the first on CD, is vigorously led by Neeme Jarvi and, save for a tremulous oboe solo, well played. The songs - ''Winterweihe,'' ''Mein Auge,'' ''Der Rosenband'' and ''Befreit,'' rapturous utterances in radiant orchestral settings - are faultlessly sung by Felicity Lott. - George Jellinek 'New Music Series,' Vol. 1: Works by Korde, Lippe, Mabry, Risset, Rubin, Scelsi and Xenakis Robert Black, double bass; Walter van Hawe, alto recorder; Mel Cuthbertson, tuba; Holy Cross Chamber Players conducted by Toshimasa Francis Wada. Neuma CD 450-71; CD only. Neuma, a label based in Acton, Mass., offers seven recent works in a sampler reminiscent of the new-music collections the major labels offered in the 1960's; indeed, a 60's avant-garde esthetic pervades the disk. Most enjoyable are two electronic pieces. Jean-Claude Risset's ''Contours,'' a tactile and sometimes spacily atmospheric work, is a study in thematic transformation; and Anna Rubin's ''Crying the Laughing and Golden'' uses the sound of laughter and whispering to create an evocative, intensely emotional soundscape. Interesting too are the glittering, variegated ''Chamber Piece'' by Shirish Korde, and Drake Mabry's ''12.5.83,'' a fleet virtuosic essay for alto recorder. - Allan Kozinn Mendelssohn: Concertos in D minor: for Violin and Strings; for Violin, Piano and Strings Gidon Kremer, violin; Martha Argerich, piano; Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. Deutsche Grammophon 427 338; CD and cassette. It's in just this sort of peripheral repertory, which requires first-rate performances to make it at all effective, that we've too often had to settle for well-meant mediocrity. Nothing of the sort here, as two supreme virtuosos, admirably supported by the conductorless Orpheus ensemble, throw their formidable artistic weight into impetuous, committed and compelling performances of two seldom-heard works Mendelssohn composed at ages 13 and 14. Even given such high-powered treatment, the Violin Concerto of 1822 cannot rival its famous E minor counterpart of 1844 in formal concision or lyrical refinement, but both youthful works emerge here as strong, vibrant creations, fully worthy of broader exposure in such top-flight performances. - James R. Oestreich Davis: 'The Silents: Musical Scores for Classic Silent Films' London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Carl Davis. Virgin Classics 7 90785; CD and cassette. This music is the sort that makes the snobs shout ''derivative.'' Let them shout. They'll take nothing away from Carl Davis's gifts as a composer of memorable Hollywood music in the grand old tradition - eclectic but always expressive of the dramatic situation and handled with consummate flair. Sometimes Mr. Davis adapts existing music - Gottschalk tunes and traditional Chinese melodies for ''Broken Blossoms,'' hunks of ''Scheherazade'' for ''The Thief of Baghdad.'' But such original material as ''The Eagle of Destiny'' for ''Napoleon,'' the Garbo theme for ''Flesh and the Devil'' and the nightmarish Prokofievian cyclone music in ''The Wind'' stand securely on their own. The London Philharmonic plays well, and Virgin offers good sound. - Barrymore L. Scherer POP/JAZZ Jefferson Airplane: 'Jefferson Airplane' Epic 45271; all three formats. Reunited after 17 years, the Jefferson Airplane still sounds like a collection of quarrelsome bohemians with eccentric interests. ''Summer of Love,'' Marty Balin's eulogy to the hippie dream, is the likeliest hit. Paul Kantner's ''Planes'' exalts the Freudian implications of air travel. Grace Slick's ''Panda'' pleads for the salvation of the species from extinction, and her ''Common Market Madrigal'' compares erotic love with European tourism. The portentous political anthem ''Solidarity'' lists Bertolt Brecht as one of its collaborators, and the mystical ''Wheel'' proclaims, ''From the heart of the volcano the future is born.'' With all its windy blather and quirkiness, the album sounds too fresh to seem a cynical cashing-in on nostalgia. - Stephen Holden Archie Brownlee and the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi: 'You Done What the Doctor Couldn't Do' Gospel Jubilee RF-1402 (Down Home Records, 10341 San Pablo Ave., El Cerrito, Calif. 94530); LP only. The best tracks on this anthology, taken from 1948 through 1959, achieve the forward motion of a hurtling train, the deep intensity of the best art. Archie Brownlee, one of hard gospel's most influential singers, had a voice that could balloon at the end of a phrase, turn from velvet to crushed rock on a syllable. The group, which began at the Piney Woods School for blind children in Mississippi, cushions Mr. Brownlee's expeditions into passion with purring, organlike chords, occasionally backed by guitar and drums. But it's Mr. Brownlee's voice, gashing through the accompaniment, signifying a man caught up in the passion of belief, that makes these numbers work. - Peter Watrous 'Siya Hamba: 1950's South African Country and Small Town Sounds' Original Music OMA 111 (R. D. 1, Box 190, Lasher Road, Tivoli, N. Y. 12583); LP only. While recent commercial recordings from South Africa have lately been reaching the United States, ''Siya Hamba'' is a find - a glimpse into the urban and rural music of the 1950's. The urban music on side two shows how South Africans assimilated big-band pop and jump-blues; the music uses suave, jazzy harmony choruses behind powerful lead singers whose melodies still have traditional shapes. But the rural music on side one, recorded in the countryside, is the revelation. Using imported instruments like harmonica, concertina, autoharp or guitar in place of previous generations' traditional instruments, the music is raw, rhythmic and utterly joyous, with shouting, laughing audiences to prove it. - Jon Pareles Rhonda Clark: 'Between Friends' Tabu; all three formats. Ms. Clark has a pinched, tight voice that can get nasty, painted with touches of Dinah Washington or Esther Phillips's nasal tone. This is good, as her sound introduces a touch of reality into tunes heavy with ethereal synthesizer colors and distant, thumping bass lines. Recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios in Minneapolis and partially produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (the movers behind Janet Jackson, among others), Ms. Clark's debut album has the producer's special sound, clean, full of puffs of music and overdubbed voices. When she improvises, screaming through the breaks in the production on ''The Way You Are,'' it's obvious she's something special. - P. W.
