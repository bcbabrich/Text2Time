A Government-controlled newspaper said today that the governor of China's central bank had been dismissed, and a well-connected Chinese said the announcement was being circulated among senior officials in Beijing.

Li Guixian, the governor of the People's Bank of China, is being replaced as part of a revamping of the financial sector, according to Wen Wei Po, a Beijing-backed newspaper in Hong Kong. Several Chinese familiar with the case said that they too had learned of Mr. Li's removal but that it was unclear what the move meant for China's economic policies.

Mr. Li, a 55-year-old career Communist cadre who has headed the central bank since 1988, was apparently removed for two reasons. First, he was blamed for allowing a $175 million financial scandal in which more than 100,000 bondholders lost much of their capital. Move Toward Curbing Growth

And Mr. Li was regarded as being ineffective in curbing monetary growth at a time when the Chinese economy was overheating. His abrupt departure is likely to be seen as a sign that Beijing has decided it wants to curb the money supply, limit the rampant speculation in real estate and reduce credit without creating cash shortages in the countryside.
