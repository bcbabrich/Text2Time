The police and other drug experts say the distributor of China Cat may have intentionally put on the market heroin that was virtually undiluted in an attempt to draw customers seeking a more powerful high than is available from other brands. Or, they say, the distributor may have made a mistake. But they are somewhat skeptical about a mistake, because a great deal of money was at stake.

A kilogram or 2.2 pounds of heroin costs distributors at least $160,000 in New York, compared with the same amount of cocaine for $18,000 at least. By cutting the heroin in half, the distributor doubles his money. The only brake on the distributor's dilution level, the police and drug experts say, is the competition.

"If you're selling 50 percent heroin and I'm selling 80 percent heroin, they're going to buy my heroin," said Kenneth McCreary, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration in New York. China Cat Is Suspected

The latest victim, a man in his late 20's, was found on Tuesday morning, slumped in a parked car on East 97th Street near First Avenue, said Ellen Borakove, the spokeswoman for the New York City Medical Examiner, Dr. Charles S. Hirsch.

The police said yesterday that while toxicology tests of the 14 victims were not yet complete, they believed that most or all had taken China Cat. In at least one death, that of the piano tuner, full bags of the brand were found near the body.

China Cat, like most other brands of heroin in New York, sells for $10 a bag. The bags contain only a few grains of the drug, even in the highest blends. But for many users, that is enough to send them into a dreamlike stupor for four to six hours. Searching for Origin

One unanswered question is where the China Cat heroin originated, and the police have sought the help of Drug Enforcement Administration technicians. Heroin is produced from opium plants grown mainly in Myanmar and Thailand in Southeast Asia, Pakistan and Afghanistan in Southwest Asia and the southern reaches of the former Soviet Union, as well as in Colombia and Mexico.
