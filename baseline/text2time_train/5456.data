Stock prices rose for the eighth straight session yesterday, although gains were more tepid and less broadly based than they have been recently. Still, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at another record high, as did other major indexes.

The Dow gained 4.63 points, to 2,572.07. For the week the key blue-chip indicator rose 86.74 points; in the eight sessions in the current rally it has climbed 104.12. Yesterday's close represented the fourth consecutive day that the Dow set a record high.

Broader-based market gauges than the Dow also moved to records yesterday. The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.32, to 178.64, and the S.&P. 500-stock index added 0.61, to 318.66. The American Stock Exchange index was up 0.96, to a record 358.03. In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq index rose 1.36, to 434.93, and is nearing its historic high.

But indications that the market may be pausing for breath could be seen in yesterday's trading. On the Big Board, 181.9 million shares changed hands, against 208 million on Thursday. And the spread between winners and losers on the Big Board also narrowed: 844 stocks rose and 702 fell.
