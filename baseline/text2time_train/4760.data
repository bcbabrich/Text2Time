But it is the burning wells that are the major problem. The fires are so fierce and the smoke so thick that no one has even been able to make an accurate count of how many wells are ablaze. The Kuwaiti Government says more than 600 wells are on fire, but the American firefighters think the number is about half that.

Boots & Coots Inc., the third Texas company fighting the oil fires, has been trying to win the informal contest for who can put out the first fire with an experimental device that does not need large amounts of water.

The device consists of a large tube at the end of a boom that is maneuvered toward the blaze by a bulldozer with a special sheet-metal cabin to shield the driver from the heat. The tube is to be jammed over the blazing oil pipe funneling the fire, and either inert nitrogen gas or water is then to be pumped in to separate the flame from the oil that fuels the blaze and to cut off the oxygen that feeds it. Frustration Over Failure

But despite several attempts, the firefighters have been unable so far to put out any fires, making the company's chief, Boots Hansen, a stocky, instantly recognizable figure with his long white sideburns and his hard hat jammed down to his eyebrows, even more irascible than usual.

"Normally we just shoot them out with explosives, but we don't have water, so we're trying to do it this way and save about three weeks," Mr. Hansen said.

"They're pumping water from the gulf, but you still have to dig pits for it, and all that takes time," he said. "If we can do this with nitrogen or whatever, we can be maybe a month ahead."

Mr. Henry, the Red Adair executive, said the standard method for putting out oil fires is by placing a dynamite charge on the burning wellhead.
