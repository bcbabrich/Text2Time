Despite the magnitude of their loss Wednesday night to the forces that ran Japan for most of the postwar era, the leaders of the yearlong effort to rebuild the country's political and economic order seemed oddly confident today that in the long run their cause would be strengthened by the setback.

Relinquishing power to the surprise combination of the Liberal Democratic Party, which controlled the country for 38 years until last summer, and the Socialists, was certainly an embarrassment for politicians who a year ago were riding a wave of popularity amid public disgust with the establishment.

The new Government of Liberal Democrats and Socialists appeared likely, at least for a while, to derail the reformers' agenda of economic deregulation that was already losing steam, and it might also slow the introduction of a new electoral system that is the most tangible sign of reform yet.

But the leaders of the oddball alliance behind the new Government of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, the first Socialist to take power here in 46 years, clearly hesitated today to risk public wrath by denouncing any of the changes that have shaken the country for the past year.
