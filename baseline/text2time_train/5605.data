A new system of one-judge, one-case justice has cut the backlog of pending felony cases in New York City by more than 16 percent since it was introduced in January, court administrators announced yesterday.

The decline - from nearly 13,000 in early January to just under 11,000 as of last week - was the sharpest in that key indicator in at least three years, they said.

The new system, which involves both civil and criminal cases, calls for each case to be handled by a single judge, from the moment the cases enter the court system until they are settled by a verdict, a plea or a dismissal.

In addition to the drop in pending felony cases, the new system has also increased the number of cases disposed of, and the rate at which they are finished, according to the court figures.
