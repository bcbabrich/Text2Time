In 1975 came the Khmer Rouge, and for three years, eight months and 20 days we lived in fear. We just waited for our moment to be killed. We never knew when our time would come. Before the Khmer Rouge I owned a barbershop and a restaurant and a dance club. Then suddenly I had nothing. At that time we were so poor in everything -- clothes, medicine, food, everything. If we saw an animal or even an insect crossing our path, we would just kill it and eat it raw. That's how hungry we were.

In those days, whenever we saw a horsecart come to the village, we knew that one or two families would be taken away to be killed and we would never see them again. They planned to kill me, too. Three times they planned to kill me, but I escaped. But they killed my three children and my three grandchildren and my son-in-law. All were executed. If we talk in terms of Buddhism, I went to hell while I was alive.

It was only a few years when the king ruled Cambodia that I could say the country was a happy place. You do the math. The rest of my life has been suffering. I think the king has a similar feeling. I've been cutting his hair, whenever he is in the country, since 1991. He likes to chat while I am cutting.

He says he is sorry that he is old and he cannot go out to see the people; he calls them his children. He is very concerned that his children might be missing him. He compares himself to a candle that is burning out.

We are all like that. Everybody is tired. We are just tired from all the events of the past. I don't think about happiness anymore. I don't think about hope. I just work for today and eat for today. Tomorrow will be the same. I will get up and work and eat and sleep.
