The estate of the author Maurice Sendak has emerged mostly victorious in a legal battle with the Rosenbach Museum and Library in Philadelphia, which had been the repository of thousands of his original drawings and parts of his book collection before his death in 2012. In a ruling in Connecticut probate court, a judge awarded the bulk of the disputed book collection to the Sendak estate, not to the museum.

Some items had been on loan to the Rosenbach for decades, and many in the museum world expected that the Sendak material would remain there. But Mr. Sendak’s will specified that the drawings and most of the loans would remain the property of the Maurice Sendak Foundation. In 2014, representatives of his estate withdrew the works, saying they intended to follow Mr. Sendak’s directive in his will to create “a museum or similar facility” in Ridgefield, Conn., where he lived, and where his foundation is based, “to be used by scholars, students, artists, illustrators and writers, and to be opened to the general public” as the foundation’s directors saw fit.

The Rosenbach filed an action in 2014 in state probate court in Connecticut, contending that the estate had kept many rare books that Mr. Sendak had pledged to the library in his will, including two highly valuable illuminated books by William Blake and a selection of rare Beatrix Potter books.

The judge in the case, Joseph A. Egan Jr., ruled on Oct. 25 that the Blake illuminated works, which could be worth millions of dollars, do not fit Mr. Sendak’s specific language in his will that the museum should receive “rare edition books.” The estate had argued that the Blake pieces were not edition books as such but were more akin to unique works.
