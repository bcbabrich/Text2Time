Some Metropolitan Opera subscribers saw red when they received their subscription renewal notices last week. Prices for most of the Met's 3,800 seats were raised the customary few dollars, roughly 6 percent. But some seats in the orchestra section -- about 100 for each performance, said Joseph Volpe, the company's general director -- have had their prices more than doubled as the section has been reconfigured.

One irate subscriber who paid $513 for a nine-opera series this year was billed $1,053 for the same seat next season. Another, who over the last 20 years has gradually improved his seats within his price range, discovered that the seats he has held the last few seasons have been redefined.

As Mr. Volpe explained it, the seats in the orchestra section under the balconies, both on the sides and at the back, have always been discounted because the overhang intrudes on the view of the top of the proscenium (though not of the stage). But in the last three years, the Met has been whittling away at the discounted section. Borderline seats from which the view is not blocked are now considered prime orchestra seats.

Next season those seats will be $100 on weeknights, $117 on Saturdays. The seats under the side overhangs and just behind the prime orchestra section will be $70 on weeknights and $80 on Saturdays, and those at the back of the house will be $55 and $60. The least expensive balcony seats will go for $13 on subscription.
