They did familiar teen-age things. Ian Moore liked to coat the neighborhood with his graffiti tag: "E-LO." The "E" stood for Ian and the "LO" for Polo, the brand of shirt he favored. Tyrone Sinkler, called "Dizzy" for his loopy behavior, relished video games. Like other skinny youths, Khalil Sumpter found himself intimidated and worried that he was being branded a punk.

But the familiar often leads to the exceptional in the ruthless surroundings in which they lived in Brooklyn's East New York section, a neighborhood recognizable by the crunching of crack vials beneath one's feet, the plentiful guns packed under youthful jackets, the crumbling housing that stifles hopes of opportunity.

The menace that stalks the neighborhood was underscored last Wednesday when, the police say, Khalil Sumpter, 15 years old, walked up to Tyrone Sinkler, 16, and Ian Moore, 17, and shot them dead in the second-floor hallway of Thomas Jefferson High School.

In the days following, some have portrayed the killings as cold-blooded assassinations akin to the showdown at the O.K. Corral. Others have painted it as a pre-emptive act of self-defense by a terror-stricken youth. What transpired in that pink school corridor may never become fully clear, but there seems little doubt that it was the outgrowth of youthful impulses shaped by a cruel and unforgiving neighborhood.
