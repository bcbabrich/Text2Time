Now they could try to hold up federal funding to provide these devices to low-income women. IUDs have been crucial to making the biggest strides in years in reducing unplanned pregnancies, as public-health organizations and agencies work to increase the number of women who use them.

Title X and Medicaid, which is overseen by the department, have also provided for confidentiality for teenagers seeking birth control. But conservative groups like the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops have challenged that protection, urging the government to mandate parental involvement. Ms. Manning is now in a position to push for rewriting the rules, even though research shows that would mean fewer teenagers getting services from family planning clinics.

The list of rules that Ms. Yoest and Ms. Manning could try to change goes on. There’s the protocol for the so-called abortion pill to terminate pregnancy, which is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, an arm of H.H.S. And there is the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act, which requires most employers to provide health insurance to pay for contraception. The Trump administration has already rolled back the Obama-era rule that prevented states from denying family-planning funds to Planned Parenthood. Ms. Manning could go further, by guiding states on how to cut off the organization.

Many of these shifts would prompt a legal fight. “We stand ready to bring to court anything the Trump administration does that acts arbitrarily and capriciously to harm women’s health,” said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights. Her group sued the Bush and Obama administrations when the F.D.A. refused to make emergency contraception available over the counter, and won because studies showed the government policy impeded access to birth control.

Ms. Yoest’s new role as head of public affairs for H.H.S. will be more about messaging than rules or laws. She’ll oversee about 90 employees and many more contractors and a budget of more than $30 million. She’ll help coordinate news releases from all parts of the agency, including the C.D.C. and the F.D.A. She’s the department’s chief Freedom of Information Act officer. And she’s in charge of its websites and digital campaigns.

Kevin Griffis, who held Ms. Yoest’s new post during the Obama administration and now works at Planned Parenthood, pointed out in an interview that during the Zika outbreak, the C.D.C. was frank in saying that birth control — in this case, condoms — was crucial for preventing the spread of the virus. The next time contraception or another aspect of reproductive rights factors into a crisis, will the same public-health imperative hold at H.H.S.? “No matter who is in office, scientists and doctors are on the lookout for inappropriate political meddling in their work,” Mr. Griffis said.
