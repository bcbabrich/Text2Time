During the course of the meeting, the incredible number of problems related to skunk ‐ keeping were outlined:

¶The city forbids keeping certain wild animals — the skunk among them — In the home, even when they are bred to be pets. The maximum penalty is $1,000 fine or one‐year imprisonment, or both, but there have been no recent prosecutions.

(Keeping a skunk elsewhere in the state, when not prohibited by the locality, is legal with a state permit that costs $1. Wendy Winsted, who works for a veterinarian and is the club's founder, instructs club members to obtain this permit in the belief that it overrides the city legislation. The City Health Department says that it doesn't. In any case, for fear of the city, many members would not reveal their last names for publication.)

¶A skunk, once its glands are removed, is defenseless in the wild. So if the little creature's depredations around the house and need for attention (at least an hour of handling daily) become too much for the owner, there remains an enormous moral responsibility not to release it in the woods.

¶Skunks are nocturnal and stay up all night unless they are “switched.” One member, Terry, explained that she was trying to keep her skunk up all day so he'd sleep all night, but so far he was only “half switched,” which is to say he wakes her up “every single morning at 6.”

¶A skunk fed too much during the summer will follow his natural inclination come winter and hibernate —under the bed, in the linen closet.

¶The animal in the wild foiages for food, using its long, dull claws to dig up dirt in search of insects and such. Around the home, flower pots resemble the woods. Ann, a skunk‐owner of only a few months, came home recently to “spend hours and hours cleaning up the mess. It was awful!” Incidentally, while it might be helpful if they ate insects around the house, most of the skunks are fed cat food.

¶The skunk can be trained to use a kitty litter box, but the schooling takes a great deal of patience and frequently goes awry. “He has a very nice kitty box,” one member said, “and he goes in that general area.”
