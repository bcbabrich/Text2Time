For all the good pitching, it was daring baserunning by Mookie Wilson that won the second game.

After singling to lead off the 12th and moving to second on Brooks's sacrifice bunt, Wilson, with Keith Hernandez on first on an intentional walk, took a gamble. George Foster grounded to the second baseman Johnny Ray, who flipped to Dale Berra for the force on Hernandez.

''Before the pitch, I checked with Bobby,'' said Wilson, referring to the third-base coach Bobby Valentine. ''He signaled that if it was ground ball, go all the way.''

Berra realized a split-second too late what was happening. His throw to the plate was too late as Wilson scored the winning run.

''I think we stole a run on that one,'' Wilson said.

The Mets won the first game when Bob Bailor singled with the bases loaded off Jim Bibby (3-10). The game had seemed to be over in the first inning, when the Met starter, Walt Terrell, gave up a grand slam to Jason Thompson.

But with the Mets trailing, 6-2, in the eighth, Hernandez led off with a home run over the right-field fence off the Pirate starter Lee Tunnell. Foster greeted the reliever Rod Scurry with his 17th homer over the left-field fence, and the Mets were on the move.

Scurry walked Darryl Strawberry and then was replaced by Tekulve. With one out, Brian Giles singled to put men on first and second. Rusty Staub loaded the bases when his apparent double-play grounder was bobbled by Berra.

Strawberry scored from third as Bailor hit into a fielder's choice. Wilson lined a single to right to score Giles with the tying run.
