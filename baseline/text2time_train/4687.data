IT'S all upbeat now. Magic Johnson's return to the Los Angeles Lakers is a triumph for him, for the Lakers' stature, for the National Basketball Association's image, for the spirit of others infected with H.I.V., the virus that leads to AIDS, for basketball and sports in general. But there's a downbeat, too.

"We're all concerned about a limited number of games," said Jerry West, the Lakers' general manager. "This raises questions for the coaches."

Yes, questions for Randy Pfund, the Lakers' rookie coach, and his staff. But also questions for Magic Johnson and his teammates. Questions that won't be answered until the season progresses, until Magic decides how well and how often he can play, until his teammates learn how to adjust when he's not there, until opponents discover if at age 33 this is the Magic of old or an old Magic.

Don't be fooled by what Magic accomplished in earning an Olympic gold medal with the Dream Team and in being voted the most valuable player trophy in last season's N.B.A. All-Star Game.
