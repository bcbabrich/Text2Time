Voices were hoarse from cheering by the end of the evening on Tuesday, when the Paul Taylor Dance Company opened its three-week season at City Center. Mr. Taylor's new ''Fiends Angelical'' is not a major work, though his minor works have a way of joining that august company as years go by. But two classics -- ''Arden Court'' and ''Esplanade'' -- completed the program in the superbly danced single performances of the engagement.

One of the pleasures and challenges of entering into Mr. Taylor's cosmos is that things tend to be not quite what they seem. Angels are suspiciously diabolical. Devils have an almost imperceptibly angelic tinge or a redeeming dose of comic misbehavior. But the feeling persists in ''Fiends Angelical'' that Mr. Taylor himself has not quite decided on who is who and what is what in the new piece, which spins out into space as a tightly constructed ritual and then ends abruptly and inconclusively.

All rituals need at least temporary resolutions. The problem may be that ''Fiends Angelical,'' set to a dark anecdotal score by George Crumb, is something of an occasion piece, commissioned for a 70th-birthday tribute to the choreographer at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival last summer. Given Mr. Taylor's enjoyably anarchic impulses, it is unsurprising that the new dance is on the slight side.

A clan of tight, crooked-limbed bodies whirl and caper across the stage. The nuzzling and entangling of two disgorged members (Patrick Corbin and Lisa Viola) add moments of serenity to the mix. Presiding over them all is a horned goddess (Silvia Nevjinsky), whose rising and falling arms suggest a puppeteer's domination. The creatures rise high on their feet at the end, their arms waving softly in the dimming light. Are these fiends crossing over to the side of the angels?
