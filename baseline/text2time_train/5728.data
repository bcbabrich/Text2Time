Assemblyman Angelo J. Fortunato, Democrat of Glen Ridge, has been indicted on charges of soliciting and receiving bribes to obtain jobs for people with the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, state officials said today.

Attorney General Irwin I. Kimmelman said a state grand jury had indicted Mr. Fortunato, 39 years old, and Robert Pierce, 44, an automobile dealer from Montclair.

Donald R. Belsole, director of the State Division of Criminal Justice, said Mr. Fortunato, between the spring of 1983 and Aug. 24, 1984, had demanded $4,000 from a Clifton man, Vito Maglione, to get jobs for his two sons at the Turnpike Authority. The Magliones were not charged. Officials said James Holland, an unindicted co-conspirator, had paid $2,000 to Mr. Pierce in the case.

Mr. Fortunato is to be arraigned on May 17 in Superior Court in New Brunswick, and he will remain free until then, Mr. Belsole said.
