When President Bush announced his support last week for a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, his body language in the Roosevelt Room did not seem to match his words. Mr. Bush may have forcefully defended the union of a man and a woman as ''the most fundamental institution of civilization,'' but even some White House officials said he appeared uncomfortable.

When Mr. Bush finished his five-minute statement -- with reporters arranged before him in White House-assigned seats, waiting for the news conference that appeared to be coming -- he abruptly turned on his heel and strode from the room, ignoring all questions.

''Is he coming back?'' a television reporter called out.

He was not.

Mr. Bush was acting under enormous pressure from his evangelical Christian supporters, who had intensified their demands in recent months that the president speak out in defense of traditional marriage. His more moderate supporters, on the other hand, worried that he might look like a gay basher.

Mr. Bush's friends say that is hardly the case and that the president is quite comfortable with gays. Laura Bush, when asked in a recent interview by The New York Times if she and her husband had gay friends, easily replied: ''Sure, of course. Everyone does.''
