The 15th Duke of Bournemouth has never had an easy time of it. When he was a baby in the 1960's, his father, the hippie 14th duke, and his American mother mislaid him in a restaurant. As an adult named Tommy (Eric Idle), the adopted son of a Pakistani family living in London, he continues to get the short end of the stick. He's a passive fellow until the day he finds out that he's the rightful heir to the Bournemouth title.

It's then that Tommy takes action. He schemes to kill off the bogus 15th duke, a nervy American nitwit named Henry (Rick Moranis), who also happens to be his best friend. Though it's never really clear how Henry fell into his good fortune, don't look cockeyed gift horses in the mouth.

It makes no difference that "Splitting Heirs," a brisk new English farce, has a plot more hysterically convoluted than that of "The Big Sleep." The film is a genial entertainment in the Monty Python tradition, a series of madly illogical sequences that even include something a screen card identifies as "Hindu Dream Sequence."

As written by Mr. Idle and directed by Robert Young (an English film maker not to be confused with the American director of the same name), "Splitting Heirs" rambles with spirit and speed. The jokes and comedy routines are often intentionally awful ("I'm bisexual; whenever I want sex, I buy it"), and sometimes hilarious even though not entirely new.
