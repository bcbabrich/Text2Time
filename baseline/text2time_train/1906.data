The Queens Library issued a news release on Friday morning boasting that, yet again, it had the highest circulation last year of any public library system in the United States.

The Public Library Data Service Statistical Report, issued by the American Library Association, found that the Queens Library lent 21,033,861 items in the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2007. The Multnomah County Public Library in Oregon, which includes Portland, was No. 2, with 19,589,530 loans.

The Queens Library system has been No. 1 in the national ranking many times before — including last year — so this latest news was no surprise. But this passage in the Queens Library’s news release was eye-catching:

Public library usage is expected to rise dramatically in the coming months. Traditionally, people turn to public libraries during hard economic times for free entertainment, free after-school child care, to help with employment, for free access to the public use computers and to help them save money by doing things themselves, such as home and auto repairs. Queens Library saw a 16 percent jump in circulation and attendance immediately following Sept. 11, for instance.

After the last recession in the United States, in 2001, the American Library Association reported that library usage had risen sharply and that 91 percent of adults believed libraries would play an important role in the future, even with the information revolution accompanying the rise of the Internet. There have not been any national studies yet on whether the current economic downturn has influenced library patronage.

The Queens Library said that its circulation for the fiscal year that ended on June 30 was 22.8 million — another record — but comparisons with other library systems for the 2008 fiscal year won’t be available until next year.

Although Queens is only the second most populous borough, its library circulation has traditionally far surpassed that of New York City’s two other library systems, the Brooklyn Public Library and the New York Public Library, which also runs circulating libraries in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island. Those two systems circulate about 16 million items a year.

A report last year by the city’s Independent Budget Office suggested that city financing be adjusted. Though the three library systems receive city money in proportion to their populations, city financial support per library visit is considerably lower in Queens than for the other two systems, because of the high circulation in Queens.
