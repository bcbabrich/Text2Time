The shoe salon at Roaman's, the specialty shop that concentrates on apparel in large sizes, carries a wide selection of fashionable reptiles in sizes up to 11 and widths up to EEE for fall.

Cobra and alligator are among the reptiles that appear alone or in combination with suède or smooth leather. Evening shoes include many suèdes with satin details, and open shoes are available for day or evening. Textured stockings with wider stretch tops to accommodate the ample leg are available in sizes 10 to 12.
