It was not immediately clear what led to the ouster of Mr. Mukherjee, who was succeeded as Finance Minister by V. P. Singh. Mr. Singh was Commerce Minister until four months ago, when he left the Cabinet to plan the Congress Party campaign in Uttar Pradesh, which has the biggest representation in Parliament. Mr. Gandhi's party won 83 of the state's 85 seats.

16 Are New Appointees

The new Council of Ministers consists of 14 Cabinet members and 25 ministers of state, who are junior government members. The ministers include 16 new appointees.

Among these are two former diplomats, K. Natwar Singh and K. R. Narayanan, a former Ambassador to Washington. Despite their expertise, neither was named to help Mr. Gandhi with foreign affairs but instead to the Steel Ministry and the Planning Ministry respectively as ministers of state.

To back up his proclaimed effort to provide efficient government, Mr. Gandhi chose several members who have strong administrative records but are known for their earlier hostility to his mother. These include Abdul Ghafoor, a former Chief Minister of Bihar State, and K. C. Pant, a former Minister for Home Affairs. Mr. Ghafoor was named Housing Minister and Mr. Pant was given charge of education.

A factor that seemed to have weighed with Mr. Gandhi in his Cabinet choices is relative youth - some of the new officials are in their 30's or 40's.

The appointments also reflected an attempt to keep a check on provincial party bosses by naming some of their key opponents to Cabinet posts. For example, the Railways Minister is Bansi Lal, a former Chief Minister of Haryana State and a bitter foe of the current Chief Minister. And Mr. Chavan, the new Home Affairs Minister, is no friend of the Maharashtra Chief Minister, Vasantrao Patil.

A Post for a Relative

As in Mr. Gandhi's previous administration and that of his mother, a relative finds a place in the new Government. This time it is Arun Nehru, the outspoken party general secretary and a cousin of Mr. Gandhi, who has been named junior minister for power. Previously, Mrs. Gandhi's aunt, Sheila Kaul, had held the education post.
