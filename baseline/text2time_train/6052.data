Government is having some difficulty defining a family. It still approves of the idea of family (except in the Justice Department's organized crime division). But there is confusion about just who belongs to a nuclear family and who belongs to an extended family and what ought to be the legal rights of each. The innocent may think that a crude kind of genetic democracy decides such things; that biologically qualified applicants belong where they wish, subject to the sufferance of matriarchs and patriarchs. But the state is getting edgy.

It took a 5‐to‐4 decision of the Supreme Court, for instance, to reaffirm the right this week of Mrs. Inez Moore to share her “single‐family” home in East Cleveland with a son, a grandson and a second grandson whose mother had died. The trouble was a zoning ordinance that allowed only one family for each dwelling unit, and defined family in the nuclear sense to mean a head of household, a spouse, only one of the couple's parents, the couple's unmarried children and the minor children of only one of the children. Mrs. Moore drew a five‐day jail sentence and $25 fine because she gave shelter to two minor children of two of her children. East Cleveland argued that zoning against crowding and against extended families would be useless unless the line were drawn somewhere; given the special circumstances at the Moores, it could not understand why they refused to seek a zoning variance, which would surely have been granted.

After four years, and with the help of the Legal Aid Society, Mrs. Moore found a slender majority on the Supreme Court willing to strike down the law as hostile to “family itself.” “The tradition of uncles, aunts, cousins and especially grandparents sharing a household has roots equally venerable and equally deserving of constitutional recognition,” the Court held, clearly but conservatively. Note the especially grandparents; observe that only a tradition with roots as deep as the common law itself could have survived the state's assault. One Justice siding with Mrs. Moore preferred to defend her rights in property instead of blood. And the Chief Justice did not think the Constitution should be bothered with family trees and roots as long as Mrs. Moore refused so stubbornly to treat Johnny Moore Jr. like an extension of the porch, as a zoning variance.

The conflict, on reflection, is not between law and nature but between myth and reality. Government must codify convention and it has codified a fiction: the family composed of male provider, female homemaker, an adorable child or two or three. Society, however, persists in pruning and replanting the family tree. Half the mothers are off to work; innumerable homes are run by a single parent; youngsters flock into family communes; old folks congregate in the sun. The family becomes what the heart or stomach declares it to be.
