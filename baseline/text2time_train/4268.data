To the Editor:

In "The Mood Turns Ugly," my Jan. 26 letter concerning "The Unfair Immigration Burden," your Jan. 11 editorial on illegal immigrants, I erred in saying two million people would be .6 percent of the population of California. It would, of course, be 6 percent. I still want to know how they are being counted and who's counting them. (Msgr.) E.
