In Washington, the Rev. Sean McManus, the President and founder of the Irish National Caucus, an Irish lobby on Capitol Hill, said: "My reaction, to paraphrase Dr. Martin Luther King, is peace at last, peace at least, thank God Almighty, we have peace at last."

But, expressing misgivings, Father McManus said: "I believe that there is an obvious danger that loyalist paramilitaries will set out to sabotage the cease-fire. That's the danger everybody fears. Nonetheless, I am hopeful that because of the outpouring of world support to this new development they'll think twice about doing that, because it would put them in an untenable position."

Father McManus said assassinations carried out in the past by Protestant militants had always raised suspicions of British complicity. "Now with the I.R.A. on cease-fire, this is going to be an absolute test of the commitment of the British Government and the British Army to this peace process."

Paul O'Dwyer, the New York lawyer long active in seeking an end to the British presence in Northern Ireland, said: "A cease-fire does not eliminate the position of the British Army in Ireland. I will not be happy about the situation till they have left."

But he said he believed the truce would endure. "I think the cease-fire will hold because I believe the British have really been tired of paying out $75 billion a year for the maintenance of a British Army on Irish soil." Issue of British Presence

Frank Durkan, a colleague of Mr. O'Dwyer in the firm of O'Dwyer & Bernstein, and a member of the Brehon Law Society, composed of many Irish-American lawyers who have defended I.R.A. members in the United States, said, "Of course, there's no need to emphasize it's always good to hear that killing and maiming has come to a stop. That's certainly a plus from anyone's point of view."

But, he said, "Nowhere do I hear that the British have declared an intention of leaving Northern Ireland. That means that another generation or two or three may look and see that there is an intruder in their land and elect to once again start hostilities. I'm cautiously optimistic. I'm not ready to go out and dance in the streets."
