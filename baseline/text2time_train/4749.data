Noureddine Morceli of Algeria celebrated his 21st birthday yesterday by setting a 1,500-meter indoor world record with a time of 3 minutes 34.16 seconds in the Placido Fernandez Viagas track meet.

Morceli broke the record of 3:34.20 set exactly one year ago on the same track by Peter Elliott of Britain. The Algerian, a student at the University of Southern California, was followed by Fermin Cacho of Spain at 3:35.26 and Mario Silva of Portugal, whose official time was not reported.

Officials first said Morceli had run the race in a world-record-shattering 3:33.14. But they corrected the time after ruling that one of the race clocks had been stopped too soon. Fast Early Pace

Still, Morceli's official time, which was not released until more than one hour after the race ended, edged Elliott's mark. Morceli was helped by a American pacesetter, Kevin Washington, who set a blistering 1:53.55 pace for the first 800 meters.
