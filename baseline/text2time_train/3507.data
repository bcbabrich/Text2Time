''We're Gary Hart but we have money,'' said Will Robinson, Mr. Bradley's senior adviser, who toiled in the campaigns of Walter F. Mondale in 1984 and Michael S. Dukakis in 1988. ''We're Gary Hart but we're putting together a structure and an organization and a full slate. We're Gary Hart but we know the rules.''

The most concrete sign of the potency of the Bradley organization is that it has amassed nearly $12 million this year -- compared with almost $18 million for the Vice President -- and has spent its resources far more carefully. Mr. Gore has only about $2 million more than Mr. Bradley in the bank. That means that Mr. Bradley has the financial capacity to be competitive through at least the first round of contests.

A convincing testament that Mr. Bradley is being taken seriously comes not from his campaign but from his opponent's. Steve Hildebrand, Mr. Gore's Iowa director, said his campaign was far better positioned yet he sounded almost envious as he reeled off names of his friends on the Bradley campaign, including Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Mr. Robinson, Iowa field director for Mr. Mondale in 1984.

''Here's what I'm worried about: This is such a family fight, and he's got all these smart people,'' Mr. Hildebrand said. ''I know how good they are. I wish I had Will to call to talk about this. And Paul Wellstone wouldn't be a United States Senator if it weren't for caucus organizing. Paul gets it. He's on the phone all the time calling Iowans.''

Still, most Democrats involved in the process argue that the party's nomination is Mr. Gore's to lose. As an incumbent Vice President who has been plotting his campaign for years, Mr. Gore enjoys numerous institutional advantages.

Already, Mr. Gore appears to have the support of most of the so-called superdelegates -- members of Congress, party officials and others who will automatically be sent to the Democratic convention and who account for about 20 percent of all delegates. As a result, Mr. Gore will likely start with almost 40 percent of the delegates he needs for the nomination. Mr. Gore, a Tennessean, will also benefit from deep loyalty among blacks and other minority groups as well as among white Southern Democrats who may have a predisposition to back a fellow white Southerner.

''Any time you have two people on the ballot, there's a possibility that either can win,'' said David Axelrod, a strategist in Chicago who has advised the Gore campaign. ''But I think the odds are very much in Gore's favor because of the many advantages he brings to the race. Part of the Hart deal that made him so strong in Iowa is that he snuck up on Mondale; there's no sneaking up on the radar screen here.''
