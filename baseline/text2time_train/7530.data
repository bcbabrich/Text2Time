LONDON, Nov. 29—George Balanchine's “Serenade” has become one of the staples of the Royal Ballet repertory, and yesterday at Covent Garden it was a pleasure to see it danced for the first time by a completely new cast of principals.

Vyvyan Lorrayen, Monica Mason, Merel Park, Keith Rosson and Graham Usher gave the ballet with enormous zest and that cool “Chekhov” passion it demands.

Miss Mason and Mr. Rosson were particularly successful, but the entire cast won its laurels, and the Corps de Ballet has never been seen better in this production.

Also on view were the young New Zealander Laurence Ruffell, making a very polished first attempt at the leading role in “Les Patineurs,” and a new cast in the recently revived “A Wedding Bouquet.”
