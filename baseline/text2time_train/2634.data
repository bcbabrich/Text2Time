In March 2003, Mr. Jimenez called his wife and children in Mexico and told them he was coming home. He looked thin and pale when they greeted him at the airport. The next day, his wife said, she drove him to see a team of cardiac specialists in the capital city of Tabasco.

Ms. Lopez says doctors there soon gave up on her husband and even discouraged him from seeking a transplant in Mexico City. She says doctors told her that he would die waiting for a donated heart, and that even if one became available in time, the family would never be able to afford the operation.

This year, with little money left for medicine, Mr. Jimenez took a turn for the worse. A doctor gave him less than a month to live.

"I started sobbing when he told me that it was best if I just bought him an oxygen tank and left him on his bed to die," Ms. Lopez said. "But I told him that I was going to keep fighting for my husband until it is God's will that he be left alone."

Meanwhile, family members in New York had heard a rumor that a woman with heart trouble had had a no-cost operation at a Manhattan hospital even though she was an illegal immigrant.

"We thought it would be easier this time," Columba Jimenez said, although the family learned later that operation was for a heart valve replacement, and not a transplant.

In any case, the couple packed a suitcase and headed for the American border, where Mr. Jimenez's brothers had arranged for a smuggler to lead them across by car. From there, an eight-day drive to New York City began. It ended at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue, near the Port Authority Bus Terminal, where the remainder of the $8,000 that relatives had agreed to pay smugglers exchanged hands.
