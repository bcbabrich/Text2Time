LONDON — Send in the cartoons. I’ve come to regard this as the new mantra of the National Theater, and I don’t mean the usual business of human actors dressing up like animals and monsters out of Disney and Dreamworks children’s movies. The cartoons I’m talking about are the real thing — proper, two-dimensional drawings that run and wriggle and bend all over stages they graciously share with less supple flesh-and-blood co-stars. The artist Jeff Koons‘s images of Popeye, now on view at the Serpentine Gallery, look sadly earthbound (as well as muscle-bound) compared to these spirited creations.

I ran across an especially, uh, animated troupe of animated figures Tuesday at the National’s vast Olivier Theater, romping about in “England People Very Nice,” Richard Bean’s ambitious (and sometimes hilarious) satirical history of immigrants in England. The play is staged by Nicholas Hytner, the director of the National, who in recent years has been experimenting more and more with filmed and digital imagery.

You may remember the scene-setting movie sequences from his production of Alan Bennett’s “History Boys,” for example. But those look like cave drawings compared to what Peter Bishop, the director of animation for “England People,” achieves here. Mr. Bean’s play follows a group of people of varying nationalities in an English immigration detention center as they while away the hours (waiting for permission to enter the country) by putting on a show about immigrants in Great Britain through the centuries, from the age of the Saxons to the 21st century.

The show travels both blithely and crudely through time, its large, racially mixed cast portraying French Huguenots, Irish famine fleers, Eastern European Jews and Pakistanis in broad strokes that embrace and explode the usual stereotypes. So why not take that extra step and have these cartoonish actors, on occasion, morph into real cartoons, running to lynch or be lynched or riot?

A hanging scene is handled by having the victim, a poor atheistic weaver (I think we’re in the 17th century by then), represented first by a digitally altered projection of the head of the noose-wearing actor playing him, then by a 3-D dummy that plops onto the stage. It’s a pretty funny marriage of venerable stagecraft and latter-day technology.

Animation even vies for attention with the strapping animal puppets who are the true stars of “War Horse,” the West End hit imported from the National, with exquisite depictions of fields, battle scenes and horses in motion that appear to be drawn into existence as you watch. “War Horse” is designed by the inspired Rae Smith, who also created the fairy-tale Gothic look of the National’s delightful production of “All’s Well That Ends Well,” directed by Marianne Elliott, which features cunning projections of wolves, spiders and other bump-in-the-night phenomena.

The show also occasionally flattens its living actors into two-dimensional shadow-puppet-like silhouettes (posing them against brightly back-lighted washes of eye-popping colors), so the line between the fleshly and the fantastical is uncertain. This blurring makes the nastier aspects of “All’s Well,” a hard play to love under usual circumstances, much more palatable. At the same time, Ms.

Elliott has her cast members perform their parts with finely shaded, complex emotion, reminding us that even the most basic fairy tales speak to the shadows of the human mind.

The work’s heroine, Helena, is played by Michelle Terry with a marvelous blend of pluck, resourcefulness and awkwardness that is anything but cartoonish. Ms. Terry is also the leading lady of “England People,” in an assortment of roles that are really the same role, as is often the case in time-spanning romps. For “England People” she is more or less a living, breathing cartoon – as her parts demand – and I am pleased to say that she and her fellow cast members hold their own vis-a-vis the real cartoons.

Another sort of technological wizardry is plied in the National’s production of J.B. Priestley’s “Time and the Conways,” which I also saw on Tuesday. Rupert Goold’s revival of this 1937 drama about dashed expectations turned out to be a suitable companion piece to “England People,” though the people it portrays — a complacent upper-middle-class family with cut-glass diction — couldn’t be more different from Mr. Bean’s rowdy, English-challenged strivers.

Like Mr. Bean, Priestley creates a world in which “our characters are children and their playground is time.” (That line is spoken with comic pomposity in “England People,” but it could just as easily have been delivered in earnest in “Time and the Conways.”) Priestley (best known for “An Inspector Calls”) was fascinated (as was Virginia Woolf) by Bergsonian notions of the mutability of time. “Conways” — which has three acts, set in the happy past and the unhappy future (before returning to the happy past) — allows its central character, a hopeful (then failed) writer a youthful prevision of the grim, middle-aged life to come.

Honestly, it’s not very subtle stuff, especially compared to, say, Woolf’s “To the Lighthouse.” Despite high-flown talk of time as the portraitist that shapes an eternal personality, it can all be boiled down to “If I knew then what I know now.” And Mr. Goold (who did “Festen” and the Patrick Stewart “Macbeth”) doesn’t pull off the transformational stylization that Stephen Daldry brought to another Priestley play, “An Inspector Calls,” in the early 1990’s. (The Daldry revival is being revived this year. I am alarmed at how often I find myself writing of revivals of revivals these days.)

But the production does have a couple of visual coups de theatre, including a final one in which past and present (or present and future) come together in a tableau wherein it is impossible to distinguish between actors and their projected, hologram-like images.

It’s heartening to see classic live theater and high technology playing nicely together, a trend that’s been on the rise since the Menier Chocolate Factory’s lovely digital evocation of the art of Seurat in its recent revival of “Sunday in the Park with George.” What I can’t understand is this: If theater technicians can master such complicated visual effects, how is it they’re still in the Stone Age when it comes to sound?

Even now, when I attend a musical on Broadway or in the West End, I’m aware of those goiter-like head mikes the performers sprout. And often, because of mechanical amplification, it’s impossible to figure out who is singing at any given moment. If only theatergoers’ could be treated with the respect that is being lavished on their eyes.
