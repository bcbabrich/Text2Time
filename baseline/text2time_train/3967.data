"The intent was to hurt someone in the building," said an assistant chief fire marshal, Louis Garcia, in a news conference outside the building yesterday. "Someone was out to get someone here."

Chief Garcia said that his investigators had canvassed the building, interviewing tenants, hoping to discover the identity of the arsonist and the motive behind the blaze. He did not publicly identify any suspects late yesterday. The landlord, the Green Door Realty Corporation, offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the offender, and was not considered a suspect in the blaze.

The tenants were able to return to their apartments yesterday. As they went back into the building, with its shattered windows, its beige walls now black with soot and its tile floors littered with plaster from crumbling ceilings, they spoke with anger and frustration, demanding that the arsonist be found, arrested and jailed. Most were immigrants from the Dominican Republic who paid $500 to $600 a month for three-bedroom apartments in what they described as a poor and crime-ridden neighborhood, and many worried that their plight would soon be forgotten or ignored.

"This is the ghetto and we're minorities, but we work hard here and we're not garbage," sobbed Maria Cerda, a 50-year-old office worker who said she knew the women and children injured in the fire. "These people, whoever did this, wherever they are, they have to be punished. We want justice."

The eight victims of the blaze, five of whom were critically injured, included Carmen Delgado, 35, and her two daughters, Gisnel Guzman, 5, and Alondra Guzman, 2, who lived on the sixth floor, according to relatives and the Fire Department. Sometime before the fire, Ms. Delgado had blocked the entrance to the fire escape with a wooden door, firefighters said, perhaps hoping to prevent burglars from breaking into the apartment. But it also blocked their only escape route.
