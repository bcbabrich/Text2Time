“I’m a crazy chair collector, and have way too many,” Joe Nahem said. But there’s good reason for that, he explained. Chairs – particularly lounge chairs – are among the most exciting furniture purchases you can make.

“They can be sculpture in a room,” said Mr. Nahem, an interior designer in his 50s who more than 30 years ago, as a student at Parsons School of Design, was a founder of the New York firm Fox-Nahem Associates. “They give you an opportunity – since they’re usually floating in a room rather than positioned against a wall – to do something special.”

Mr. Nahem frequently designs custom pieces for his clients, but he has also spent countless hours shopping for lounge chairs, both for clients and for himself. And there are a few things he always considers.

• How will the shape of a chair influence a room’s layout? “If it’s a square chair, everything in the room has to be lined up,” he said, so nothing looks askew. But “when you use a chair that’s a little rounded, it can be positioned anywhere, which can make things less stiff.”

• Is it a chair you’ll use every day? If so, comfort is key. “But not every chair has to be so comfortable you’re going to fall asleep in it,” he said. Especially if it’s an occasional chair used as movable seating for guests.

• Do you need more than one? “We often use pairs” to create symmetry, Mr. Nahem said. “Another setup we love is to have three chairs around an ottoman, which is a great secondary seating arrangement in a large room.”
