The Food and Drug Administration says it has serious concerns about how much of a grain is used in three new breakfast cereals and about the manufacturers' claims that the cereals can help lower cholesterol.

In letters on Friday, the agency told General Mills Inc., which makes Benefit cereal, and the Kellogg Company, which makes Heartwise and Bran Buds, to submit scientific data showing that the amount of the grain in their products is safe.

The cereals have husks of psyllium, a grain grown in India that is high in soluble fiber, which the companies say is safe and has been shown to help reduce cholesterol. Benefit also contains sugar beet fiber, and the agency asked General Mills to submit data showing it is safe.

Spokesmen for both companies said that their cereals were safe and that they would submit the requested information. Grain Used in Laxative
