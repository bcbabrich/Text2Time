NEW BRUNSWICK, N. J., March 1—Rutgers was on the brink of its first defeat tonight, but rallied from 7 points back in the last six minutes, beat St. Bonaventure, 85‐80, and became the first Metropolitan area college basketball team in a quarter century to go through a regular season undefeated.

Not since Columbia won all of its 22 regular‐season games in the 1950‐51 campaign has a local team swept its opponents. It was the 26th victory for Rutgers and when it was over the 2,800 persons in the tiny, old Rutgers gymnasium sounded like thousands more.

Within an hour of the Scarlet Knights’ big triumph, the players and Coach Tom Young rang the Old Queen's Bell in the steeple of the university administration building. Such bell ringing is usually reserved for victories over Princeton's football team and other memorable events.

However, this fast Rutgers team nearly missed the chance to become the 19th undefeated major college team in the nation since 1939.
