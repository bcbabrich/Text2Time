Read all of our “Narcos” recaps.

Season 1, Episode 9: “La Catedral”

“Narcos” has shown us the two faces of Pablo Escobar, both of which are terrifying, but revealing in contrast. One is introduced most effectively in the very first episode, with Escobar calmly thwarting an attempt to shut down one of his trafficking routes. He doesn’t need to show anger or break out the heavy artillery. All he does is identify each and every officer on the scene and talk to them about their families; they’re welcome to stop this shipment he’s so brazenly carried out into the open, but there will be consequences.

In this episode, we see a second face. Escobar flies into a rage, driving the base of a pool cue repeatedly against the head of a longtime associate he suspects of betraying him. It’s perhaps the single most vicious act of violence on a show with plenty of contenders, but it’s also a sign that Escobar’s position has dramatically weakened from where we started. Escobar built an empire on calculated violence, the need to make good on threats in order to intimidate his enemies and protect his business. Impulsive violence of the kind seen in this episode, however, has no tactical value. It’s just killing.

It’s a bit odd thinking of a mass murderer like Pablo Escobar as a “flawed hero” type, but one of the show’s consistent strengths has been its effort to step back and evaluate Escobar’s genius and hubris — and the thin line separating one from the other. At no point has he been unwilling to kill people, and there’s no evidence here that’s he’s ever shown a second of remorse about it. But “Narcos” suggests that Escobar’s failure to gain legitimate political power in Colombia was a breaking point for him, and he never quite recovered. His cohorts in the Medellín cartel blame his political ambitions for engaging the government in the drug war and sabotaging a thriving business, but that doesn’t explain the real problem with Escobar: He’s an entitled hothead. He lashes out at the bureaucrats who denied him a seat at the table. He lashes out indiscriminately at the populace when he doesn’t get his way on extradition. And he lashes out at longtime associates for bristling at the exorbitant “tax” he demands in exchange for them running his business.

“Narcos” reveals a pattern of violence linked to Escobar’s temperament. When he responds to extradition threats by blowing up a plane, his earth-scorching violence backfires; when he starts specifically targeting the family members of Colombia’s elite, he gets the political concessions he wants. His mistakes haven’t limited his ability to murder people at will, but they have backed him into a corner. Getting the government to concede to his own prison (“Club Medellín”) was an undeniable victory, but it’s only a fleeting one, because he’s too paranoid and angry to exercise power the way he did in the past. He scans for signs of disrespect like a beachcomber with a metal detector, jumping at every stray bottlecap. The Escobar of old would have calmly assessed the likelihood of his trusted partners having nothing to do with the millions dug up on their property. This Escobar feels the threat of the Cali cartel taking over and the possibility of turncoats within the Medellín cartel as power is siphoned away from him. His answer is self-defeating rage.

Escobar’s temper is mirrored this episode by Murphy’s, who’s letting his own long-term engagement in the drug war cloud his judgment. It’s nothing like beating a man to death with a pool cue, but Murphy pulling his gun on a taxi driver after a fender bender — with wife and orphaned child in the car, no less — reveals his own deteriorating judgment in the face of enormous stress. More important, it’s the first time Murphy has legitimately crossed the line on the show. His actions in the club shootout could be justified because they got Poison, one of Escobar’s most vicious sicarios; his choking of the truck driver in this episode could be justified because they need to force him into taking pictures of the goodies being delivered to Escobar’s prison fortress. But this is Murphy flying off the handle. It’s not nearly enough to put him on the wrong end of the “good and bad are relative concepts” continuum, but the needle moves a little.

The needle stands to move a lot more if Murphy and Peña engage the Cali cartel further in their effort to nab Escobar. The enemy of their enemy may be their friend for now, but eliminating the kingpin of one cartel so the kingpin of a rival cartel can take over his territory is a short-term victory that promises long-term déjà vu. When the prime directive is to get Escobar, however, Drug Enforcement Administration agents like Murphy and Peña are not responsible for thinking too hard about how the drug war over all will be affected by the hunt. They’ll catch him however they can.

Parting shots

• The peace that comes to Bogotá after the government’s concessions to Escobar is worth noting, lest we believe Gaviria to be a weak-willed coward, unwilling to stand up against a bully. For a country ravaged by narco-terrorism, the trade-off of Club Medellín is sensible. …

• … so long as photographs of Escobar’s luxury prison don’t happen to surface in the news media. For Gaviria, this is when a concession for peace becomes a woeful political embarrassment.

• Wagner Moura has been terrific as Escobar all season, but never better than the moments before he unloads on one of the men he’s entrusted with running the business. Those eyes, that twitching of the arms — if he were a cartoon character, smoke would be coming out of his ears.

• Talk of a tunnel under Escobar’s prison compound can’t help but recall Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the Mexican drug kingpin known as El Chapo who recently escaped from prison via tunnel. The tunnel was a mile long, 5.5 feet tall and lighted and ventilated for easy travel. No word on the contents of El Chapo’s jailbreak Spotify playlist.
