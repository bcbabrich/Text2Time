This is unfortunate because the teen years are a time when sports participation can have its greatest benefits. Multiple studies show that children who participate in sports are less likely to smoke, consume illegal drugs and alcohol, miss classes, drop out of school and become pregnant. In addition, for those involved in sports, self-esteem tends to rise and the ability to solve problems, handle adversity and be creative improves.

''I think the biggest problem is that kids don't make the high school team, or the junior high school team, and drop out,'' said Richard Lapchick, founder of the Center for the Study of Sport in Society at Northeastern University. ''Kids think that if they don't make the team that their career is over, therefore they should stop competing or playing or doing anything that makes them physically fit.''

The common perception is that the United States is a sports-crazed country that believes strongly in the value of sports for our youth. But when you peel back the layers of the onion, you see that what we really value is elite sports programs. From the professional level to traveling club teams for 8-year-olds, our focus as a society is on elite athletes. Resources start being directed toward programs for elite athletes when children are young.

''There's a disparity in sports, the fact that there is so much at the top and not enough at the bottom,'' said Tom McMillen, a former congressman and N.B.A. player. ''If you look at America, we have very few resources at the bottom for our kids. We certainly have plenty of resources at the top. We can build megastadiums, pay megasalaries for athletes, but we're not doing enough at the bottom.''

Drew A. Hyland, author of ''Philosophy of Sport'' (Paragon House, 1990), sees part of the solution overseas. ''I think a wonderful thing would be for the United States to develop a more active sports club system of the sort that you see in Europe, where folks keep on playing actively in leagues and so forth on into adulthood,'' Hyland said.

In most European countries, there is a sports club for everyone. If you are a premier athlete, there is a team for you. If you are an athletically challenged kid, but still love the game, there is also a team for you. Clubs in Europe will often have an ''A'' team, a ''B'' team, a ''C'' team, on down, so everyone is accommodated.

To change the disturbing decline in the physical fitness in America, we need to do a better job spreading the word about the poor state of our children's physical fitness and the long-term impact that will have on their health. We must have more physical education in our schools, not less. And we need more recreation, intramural and club programs that provide organized sports opportunities for all ages and levels of ability.

As parents, administrators, legislators, teachers and coaches, it is up to us to find ways to get more children involved and keep them participating longer. Will it be physical fitness or physical ''fatness'' for our youth?
