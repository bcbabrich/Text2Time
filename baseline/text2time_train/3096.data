Trina Clark aka Thunda, West Palm Beach, Fla., Nov. 5, 2000

''That's my working corner, the corner where you can catch me. I see what's coming from both directions and if the law enforcement's coming. If I don't want a date to know that I'm male, I stand in the shade. I consider myself a real woman, but I'm not. I am a hustler.

''I know what I have to get out of people to get what I need.

That night, it was a so-so night. If I make $30 or better on my first date, my luck will be good all night, and my first date was $100 and something. I think I had eight or nine dates that night. A good night is 40 or better. I catch dates. I'm the one throwing the rod out there to pull in fish. I can get lucky. It can happen every day.

''When I'm out there, I have to think about where I'm going to get a decent meal, trying to get a place to stay, where I am going to get a hot shower. (Taking a bath with a water hose isn't cutting it.) All that runs through my head. I don't ever think negative. I think positive. I get into a good mood -- not thinking that I'm all that, but just a good mood. Talking to myself and singing or making up songs in my head. My feet were hurting, but I'm not a quitter. I don't put myself down and say I'm not going to make enough tonight.

''I need a place to stay. I've been homeless. My mother told me the streets are not like home. She was right. It's hard and it's rough, and you've got to know how to play the game. But I'm the original -- Thunda. I can't be anyone else, and nobody can be like me.'' interview by Catherine Saint Louis
