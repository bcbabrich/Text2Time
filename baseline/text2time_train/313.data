In the wake of the spectacular best-picture snafu at Sunday’s night Oscars, the fallout has begun.

The two PwC accountants involved in the envelope mix-up that saw the producers from “La La Land” accepting the best picture award before everyone realized it belonged to “Moonlight” will not be working at the Oscars again, according to a spokeswoman for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

One of the accountants, Brian Cullinan, a partner at PwC, had handed Warren Beatty the incorrect envelope moments before the actor went onstage with Faye Dunaway to present the best picture Oscar. Martha L. Ruiz, the other PwC accountant who worked the awards with Mr. Cullinan, will also not be returning, the academy said.

Mr. Cullinan had mistakenly given Mr. Beatty a duplicate envelope for best actress, which had just gone to Emma Stone for “La La Land.” After Mr. Beatty read that envelope’s contents, he showed it in confusion to Ms. Dunaway, who saw the words “La La Land” and triumphantly announced it the winner, creating what has been widely described as the most outrageous mistake in modern Oscars history.

After the accountants realized the error, they scrambled onstage with the ceremony’s stage manager to retrieve the wrong envelope and open the right one, revealing that “Moonlight” had pulled off an upset. In those chaotic moments, fingers immediately pointed to Mr. Beatty as the culprit; on Tuesday, he issued a statement deflecting questions and asking that Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the academy president, clarify what happened.
