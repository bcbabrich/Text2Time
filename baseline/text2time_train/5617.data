Charlotte Ford, a daughter of Henry Ford 2d of Detroit and Mrs. Deane F. Johnson of New York and Southampton, L.I., was married last evening to Edward Reynolds Downe Jr., the son of Mrs. Edward D. Lane of New York and the late Edward R. Downe. The Rev. John Twiname, a Presbyterian minister, officiated at Miss Ford's Southampton home.

Elena Ford was maid of honor for her mother. Hugh W. Downe was best man for his father. Hilary and Richard Hayes, daughter and son-in-law of the bridegroom, as well as Jeanne Downe, the bridegroom's daughter-in-law, also participated in the ceremony.

The evening also marked Mr. Downe's 57th birthday. His wife is 45.

Miss Ford, who will retain her name professionally, was educated in private classes in Grosse Pointe Farms, Mich.; Noroton, Conn.; Florence, and Paris. She is a fashion designer and consultant and has written books on etiquette and shopping. Her father, former chairman of the Ford Motor Company, is a board member and chairman of the finance committee of the company, which was founded by his grandfather Henry Ford.

Mr. Downe, a native New Yorker, graduated from the Journalism School of the University of Missouri in 1952. He began his journalism career in the editorial departments of True and then Argosy, two magazines that were to become the first acquisitions of his company, Downe Communications Inc. He later acquired The Ladies' Home Journal, American Home and Family Weekly. He has relinquished his title as chairman of Downe Communications and now devotes himself to private investments.
