Tugboat workers who went out on strike Feb. 1 will vote this morning on a new manage ment offer.

The first offer—a 43 per cent package over three years —was rejected by Local 333, United Marine Division, Na tional Maritime Union, on March 15. Maritime observers said yesterday that the current offer probably constituted a juggling of the old package, with more money going to wages.

It has been management's contention in recent weeks that the 43 per cent increase, includ ing 32 per cent in wages, was the limit, especially in view of widespread opposition to such a large offer in employer ranks.

Management sources and others close to the dispute con tinued to express amazement yesterday as to why the union's leadership was unable to “sell” the 43‐per‐cent package.

There is general agreement on both sides that the package was a good one—by itself and in relation to recent labor set tlements in the maritime in dustry.
