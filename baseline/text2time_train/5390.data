Another orchestral choice must be made a week from Saturday, because both the Westchester and White Plains Symphonies are in musical action on March 14. At 8 o'clock that evening, the music director, Martin Canellakis, leads the Westchester Symphony in an all-Mozart evening presenting Lee Luvisi (the noted pianist of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center) in the so-called Elvira Madigan Concerto in C, K.467, and showcases the artistry of four principal players in the Westchester Orchestra - Margaret Helfer, Matthew Goodman, Susan Panny and Gines Cano - via the Symphonie Concertante for Oboe, Clarinet, Horn and Bassoon. Rounding things out is Mozart's ''Prague'' Symphony No. 38 (238-4544).

Half an hour later, the music adviser, Kenneth Schermerhorn, will also be conducting Mozart, specifically the Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Orchestra, at the White Plains Intermediate School. Because this is a continuation of the ''New York Philharmonic Night at the White Plains Symphony,'' which was begun so successfully last season, the two youngest members of the Philharmonic - Kerry McDermott and Rebecca Young - have been invited to share the solo spotlight. After intermission, however, comes the expansive Mahler Fourth Symphony with another fine young American artist, Elizabeth Henderson, joining the orchestra for the exquisite soprano song that dominates the last movement (725-1880 or 472-2361).

Completing the orchestral circle on March 15 is the Philharmonia Virtuosi, returning to the State University with what its brochure calls ''an All-Baroque Spectacular.'' Departing from his usual pattern of spicing the warhorses with concert rarities, the music director, Richard Kapp, has this time elected to stay with three of the most popular works by the three most famous Baroque composers. On the list: Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons'' with the Philharmonia Virtuosi's concertmaster, Paul Peabody, as soloist; the Third Suite for Orchestra by Bach, and excerpts from Handel's ''Royal Fireworks Music'' (693-5595).

Among concerts of note on the solo and chamber fronts, we find the superb young pianist Bennett Lerner playing works of Copland, Thomson, Ravel, Chopin and several other composers at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, a recital beginning today at 3 P.M. (963-4550); or head over to the Community Unitarian Church in White Plains at the same hour, where the Casa Verde Trio continues its season in residence, playing the great Tchaikovsky A minor Trio and, with the superb young soprano Dawn Upshaw as guest artist, a selection of Beethoven's Irish and Scottish folk songs (946-1660). Also on today's schedule is an 8 P.M. concert at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers presenting the solo and chamber music of the composer Andre Singer, who taught at the college for more than 30 years until his retirement in 1977 (337-0700).

Three superb artists, all of whom have appeared in the county with other partners, have joined to form a new group called ''Contrasts.'' If you know the celebrated piece of that title by Bartok, you will have guessed correctly that the complement of the ensemble is clarinet, violin and piano, and indeed the Bartok is prominently featured on the program that Esther Lamneck, Yuval Waldman and Thomas Hrynkiw have designed for their collective county debut. The 8:30 P.M. Saturday recital, in the Sleepy Hollow Series at Tarrytown's Washington Irving School, also lists trios of Bruch, Mozart and Milhaud (332-0382).
