''There's a strong feeling this is a marriage, not an affair,'' the official said.

Mr. Mehta was one of 40 candidates offered by the recruiting firm of Spencer Stuart & Associates, but he quickly topped the list, Mr. Guenther said. ''We were told the best is Zarin Mehta, but you'll never get him,'' he said. He called Mr. Mehta ''the best executive director in the country.''

Mr. Mehta, since 1990 president and chief executive officer of Ravinia, the open-air music festival in Highland Park, near Chicago, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's summer home since 1936, said that his appointment, given his family's history, was ''an extraordinary move for me.'' In addition to his brother's involvement with the Philharmonic, his father, Mehli Mehta, a violinist and conductor, studied in New York in the 1940's. A cousin, Bejun Mehta, is a countertenor who as a boy soprano sang for Leonard Bernstein.

By contrast, Zarin Mehta, who was born in Bombay, entered the music world as an accountant. Trained in England, he sought an accounting job in New York in 1962 but was turned away for fear he might head back to Europe or go to Canada to escape the Vietnam-era draft. He did move to Canada to work for the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand and joined the board of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, becoming its vice president. In 1981 he was named managing director and served until 1990, when he took over the Ravinia Festival.

His musical training was nil, he said proudly. ''My parents successfully kept me away from it,'' he said. For his administrative duties, he said, ''accounting is better than being an oboe player.'' He said he looked forward to working with Mr. Masur and, if plans jelled, with Mr. Muti. ''It's a very strange marriage, music director and executive director,'' he said. ''They're jointly responsible. They have to be thinking along the same lines.''

Could he have worked with his brother, Zubin? He didn't pause to consider it. ''We would have fought tooth and nail,'' he said.

As for his plans for changes at the Philharmonic, he said it would be presumptuous to speak of that yet. But he had one priority. ''I want to attend a parks concert,'' he said.
