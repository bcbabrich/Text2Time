WASHINGTON, Feb. 29(AP) —The General Accounting Office has found that Congress was not notified of 34 agreements between the United States and South Korea since Congress enacted a reporting requirement in August 1972.

The 34 agreements were operating carrying‐out, or agency‐to‐agency agreements and were not reported to the State Department Office of Treaty Affairs the Congres sional investigating agency reported.

The Treaty Office has the responsibility to transmit to Congress the text of any “international agreement” within 60 days under the Case Act, sponsored in Congress in 1972 by Senator Clifford P. Case, Republican of New Jersey.

But the Accounting Office said the Case Act did not define “international agreements’ and that agencies such as the Agency for International Development which administers foreign aid overseas, and the Defense Department did not consider subordinate agreements subject to the reporting requirement.
