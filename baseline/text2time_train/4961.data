This is the home and the era we like to pretend we remember - ''when life was slow and oh, so mellow'' and ''when no one wept beside the willow.''

The inhabitants of Fantasticks-land are two middle-aged fathers who garden and play cards, one 20-year-old man who has not developed beyond the level of a young adolescent and one 16-year-old girl who is as riddled with far-fetched notions of romance as Swiss cheese is with holes. There are no mothers around to get in anybody's way.

The manipulative fathers have built a wall between their houses on the perverse theory that if they discourage their children from being friends, the boy and girl will assert their independence by growing up and getting married.

''The Fantasticks'' spins a plot that is pure romantic fantasy shaded by the golden glow of make-believe. Its philosophy is conservative in spirit: in this musical, the only place for a woman is in the house, the world that begins on the other side of the garden's kumquats is not worth visiting and the love you find among your own kind is best.

In the Studio Theater production directed by Macey Levin, the show seems to traipse along at an unduly slow pace. It is as though the actors have moved along through the three decades since ''The Fantasticks'' opened, and are now forcing themselves back in time as if they were walking backward across a sticky field of discarded spun sugar. Nothing in this production seems to without great effort.
