''I've never been number oriented,'' he said. ''I don't believe in saying this game ranks first or that game ranks second. But there have been several games that I could roll into a ball, so to speak, as the most meaningful of my career.''

Quickly, he mentioned four games early in his Met career.

''The game against the Cubs at Shea in 1969 when I had a no-hitter going into the ninth. The game I struck out 19 against San Diego in 1970, and another game in 1970 in Los Angeles when I struck out 16 in 12 innings before I went out with the score 1-1. And the game in 1969 when I won 20 games for the first time, that always stays with you.''

Almost a year to the day after being traded to the Reds, he pitched a 4-0 no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals.

''I didn't have great stuff that night, but I had some great plays behind me,'' he said. ''And whenever I got hit hard, it was right at somebody.''

For all his victories, Tom Seaver didn't start thinking about winning 300 until last year.

''When I came back to the Mets after having had a sore shoulder in 1982 with the Reds, I didn't know if I'd ever pitch again,'' he said. ''But then I pitched pretty well in 1983, and then when I continued to pitch well with the White Sox last year, I realized that I was getting close. I knew another good year would get me there.''

With an 11-8 record this season, he has one more start before Tuesday's strike deadline.

''I'm not trying to beat the strike,'' Tom Seaver said. ''I'm going to get 300 anyway.''

He should be getting it for the Mets, and if he were, maybe the Mets would have won the National League East last year, maybe they would be in first place now. But the reason he's with the White Sox goes back to 1966 when Roland Hemond, now the White Sox general manager, was the California Angels' scouting director.
