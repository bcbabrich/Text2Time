After a string of smaller deals in the oil patch over the last two years, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is gearing up for a potential blockbuster takeover.

The private equity giant is in exclusive talks to buy some or all of the Samson Investment Company, a family-owned oil and natural gas exploration company, according to a person briefed on the matter.

K.K.R. has been studying a possible Samson transaction for some time and has been lining up financing with several banks, this person added, cautioning that the talks could still fall apart.

Should the two sides reach a deal, it would be one of the largest leveraged buyouts since the financial crisis of September 2008. K.K.R. can already lay claim to one of the priciest private equity deals in the last year, having led the purchase of Del Monte Foods for $5.3 billion.

Samson currently runs more than 4,000 wells and has at least partial ownership of more than 11,000 wells across the country, according to its Web site.

Among its businesses is drilling for oil and natural gas in shale formations, an increasingly popular tactic that has driven a wave of takeovers in the energy industry.

A deal would bring to a close the Schusterman family’s 40-year control of Samson, which has become a respectable oil exploration player that is still based in Tulsa, Okla. The company’s current chairwoman and chief executive is Stacy Schusterman, daughter of the founder, Charles Schusterman.

Ms. Schusterman acknowledged the company’s discussions with K.K.R. in an internal memorandum obtained by The Tulsa World:

“If a definitive agreement is reached with K.K.R., it will be because they recognize both the value of our assets and our team,” Ms. Shusterman said in the statement. “K.K.R. has stated that if we move forward, they are committed to building our team at each of our current locations.”

A K.K.R. spokeswoman declined to comment.
