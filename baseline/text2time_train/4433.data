Art Bauman, a dancer and choreographer who helped to found the Dance Theater Workshop, died on Wednesday at Tisch Hospital in Manhattan. He was 53 and lived in Manhattan.

He died of AIDS, said William Singer, his companion.

Mr. Bauman created many of his early dances for Dance Theater Workshop, an informal loft theater when he founded it in 1965 with Jeff Duncan and Jack Moore, both of whom have since died. The organization, which he helped to direct until 1975, later became one of the city's major dance institutions.

Mr. Bauman began choreographing in 1962 and became known for painstakingly planned mixed-media collagist dances that were often designed to be performed in specific theater spaces. In addition to the workshop, Mr. Bauman created pieces for Clark Center for the Performing Arts, the Columbia Arts Festival, Dance Uptown and the Cubiculo. His work was also presented at The Place in London and the New York Dance Festival in Central Park.

His best-known dance was "Dialog," a solo in which the choreographer, live and on film, portrayed a businessman racing against time and corporate pressures. Writing in The New York Times, Anna Kisselgoff described the 1965 work as enduring and "a very polished piece."
