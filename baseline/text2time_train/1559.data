There are some people you feel can never surprise you, you know them so well. You’ve spent hours in their company, you know all their little habits, you even hear what they’re going to say before they say it. And then, every so often (and it could be the 20th encounter), one of them does something that knocks you for a loop and you think, “I never really knew you at all.”

I’m talking about Hedda and Hamlet, Nora and Blanche, even the child-murdering Richard. These are figures from classical theater who show up with numbing regularity in the life of a drama critic. (I feel like I’ve hung out more with Hamlet than I have with my closest friends in recent years.)

Mostly, they hew true to anticipated form, albeit with varying degrees of polish and depth. But just once in a while, an actor or actress will shake your preconceptions to the core. That’s when it’s time bring out an adjective that’s been so overused it’s nearly lost its value: revelatory. Because what these performers do is make you see the familiar in new ways.

These reflections are occasioned most immediately by Shakespeare & Company’s production of “Richard III,” starring John Douglas Thompson, in Lenox, Mass. I’ve seen at least a dozen Richards in my life, some of them highly accomplished and quite different from one another. But I’ve never seen one with less noticeable psychological shading than that of Mr. Thompson, and I mean that as a compliment.

A richly emotional leading man in “Othello” and “The Emperor Jones” in recent years, Mr. Thompson could certainly deliver a textbook-sharp version of a psychologically maimed Richard. But the boldness of his performance lies in his choosing to play the crookback king as someone who never lets his consciousness get the better of him. He lives, as it were, in the moment in an exceedingly bloody and dangerous time. Self-reflection (and especially conscience) can make a man hesitate, and hesitation is suicide in the warring, divided England of “Richard III.”

Ever-moving and ever-unregarding, Mr. Thompson was, in a sense, history incarnate. (In his refusal to court self-awareness, he also reminded me of many a super-successful professional I’ve known. Don’t ever believe anyone who says nice guys finish first.) And “Richard III” as, above all, a history play suddenly made fresh sense to me.

In my tenure as a chief theater critic at the Times, Janet McTeer was probably the first performer to make me rethink a classic character altogether. In 1996, Ms. McTeer came to Broadway as Nora in Anthony Page’s production of Ibsen’s “Doll’s House.” On the surface, she didn’t fit the part at all. She’s a tall, commanding, even muscular woman, someone you might like to have on your pick-up basketball team. In other words, she’s nobody’s doll.

And that was exactly why she was such a real and heartbreaking Nora. There was nothing of the child-like geisha bride about her. She had to assume the role like a costume that didn’t fit, even bending her knees so that this Nora could appear shorter than her husband when he kissed her. Her Nora, in other words, was behaving unnaturally, but she had convinced herself and everyone else that this was the way she was meant to be. Ibsen’s notions of social roles that confine people had never seemed clearer or more viscerally felt.

Another ostensibly miscast actor was Simon Russell Beale in the title role of “Hamlet.” I grew up with visions of the melancholy Dane as the coolest guy on campus: handsome, long-haired, rebellious and of course always dressed in black — the beatnik (or hippie or punk) that all the girls swooned for. Mr. Russell Beale does not fit anyone’s idea of a romantic, cooler-than-thou brooder. He’s short, chubby, round-faced and middle-aged well before middle age, with no obvious attributes of leading-man glamour.

But in John Caird’s production for the Royal Shakespeare Company (which I saw a few times at the beginning of this century), Mr. Russell Beale became as close to a definitive Hamlet as I’m ever likely to see. (First runner-up: Mark Rylance, another less-than-obvious candidate.) That’s because he registers thought more transparently and intricately than any actor of his generation. And every one of those “words, words, words” that Hamlet speaks visibly connected to not just an idea but also an instinctive emotion in this prince’s mind.

For once, I was able to follow Hamlet all the way through his long journey of vacillations and convolutions of character. By the end, he had achieved a marveling but credible acceptance of who he was and how he had got there. I wept for him not because he was a classic tragic paradigm, but because he had become something like a close friend. Or maybe even closer. I don’t think I was the only person who left that performance thinking, “Hamlet, c’est moi.”

The list of other performances that fall into this category is short (and it should be). They include Cate Blanchett’s Blanche in “A Streetcar Named Desire,” Kate Burton’s Hedda Gabler and Lauren Ambrose’s Juliet. They aren’t necessarily among the very greatest performances I’ve ever seen (though Mr. Russell Beale’s Hamlet and Ms. Blanchett’s Blanche qualify in that respect, too).

Sometimes a deeply felt classical reading is the best of all, as in Christopher Plummer’s ravishing King Lear. But I reserve a special chamber of my memory for those actors and actresses who made me look anew at old acquaintances. So I imagine, do you, and I’m eager to hear your examples.
