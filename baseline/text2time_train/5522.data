''It means we have a lot of films to study this week,'' said Williams. ''I'm sure we can find something.'' It was suggested that if the Bears have a weakness on defense, it may be at cornerback. ''Maybe so,'' said Williams. Kenny Hill, the Giants' strong safety, earned a Super Bowl ring with the Raiders. He said it was a great feeling now to be playing games that counted for so much.

''I think we can do pretty well against the Bears,'' he said. ''They have a lot of talent, but I don't think it's being exploited as much as it could. With people like Jim McMahon and Walter Payton and Willie Gault and Dennis McKinnon, you think they would run up 30 points every game.'' In fact, they are averaging just under 30 a game and have scored 30 or more in only six games. ''But they still have a big-play capacity, and they can score a lot of points, as they did against the 49ers and the Cowboys,'' Hill said. The Yale Factors ''I don't think our problems are going to be on defense, but whether we can attack their defense. Any defense that has a Yale safety starting has to be reckoned with.''

The part about the Yale safety was accompanied by a sly smile. Of the 28 starting strong safeties in the league, two are Yale graduates. One is Gary Fencik of the Bears. The other is Hill.

The Bears have intimidated opponents, and Carl Banks, a Giants outside linebacker, said he was warned that they would try to do that to the Giants. He said the warning came from Sherman Lewis, who coached Banks at Michigan State. Lewis is now the offensive backfield coach of the San Francisco 49ers, and he and Banks talked after the Giants' 17-3 victory over the 49ers here Sunday.

''He said they are a mean, aggressive team,'' said Banks. ''He said they would try to intimidate us. I told him I don't think we can be intimidated, that as well as we played against the 49ers we can play better.''
