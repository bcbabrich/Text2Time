Of the men named on the list, seven ended up losing their jobs or having significant professional setbacks before the year was out. (Others who lost jobs after complaints of inappropriate workplace behavior — including Michael Oreskes of National Public Radio, a former reporter and editor at The Times, and Mike Germano of Vice Media, to name two —were not named on the list and became subjects of company investigations after allegations against them appeared in The Times, The Post and other publications.)

The GQ political correspondent Rupert Myers was the first man identified on the list to lose his job, about a week after the spreadsheet went live. Five days later, Leon Wieseltier, the former literary editor at The New Republic, apologized for his “offenses against some of my colleagues in the past,” and a new magazine he was editing under the auspices of the Emerson Collective, an organization run by Laurene Powell Jobs, was canceled. Soon afterward, the list claimed another high-ranking New Republic figure, the magazine’s president and publisher, Hamilton Fish, who resigned on Nov. 3.

Lorin Stein, the editor of The Paris Review, informed the magazine’s board that he had been named. After an investigation conducted by the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton, he resigned on Dec. 6. The next week, The New Yorker said it had parted ways with its Washington correspondent, Ryan Lizza. (CNN put Mr. Lizza on leave from his job there as a commentator, reinstating him the next month, after a company investigation “found no reason” to keep him off the air.)

The list was still having an impact in late December, when BuzzFeed fired Adrian Carrasquillo, a White House correspondent, and the National Geographic did the same with the photojournalist Patrick Witty (who has also worked for The Times).

Mr. Witty, in a written statement, denied the accusations against him, although he acknowledged that he might have acted inappropriately. “I am saddened to think that I in any way have contributed to or reinforced the imbalance of power between men and women in my industry,” he said.

The rest of those named on the list who lost jobs declined to comment.

Some of the men whose names appeared on the document but did not end up suspended or fired said the list had nonetheless affected their professional and personal lives.

“It’s so naïve to think that just because no one has spoken out, that means that there aren’t any false accusations,” said a man who agreed to discuss the document only if his name was not used, because he did not want to draw further attention to his appearance on the list. “It just means that the men that have been falsely accused are petrified.”
