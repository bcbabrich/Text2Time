Scott Gewirtz, co-head of government bond trading at Deutsche Bank, said "the market has been complacent about inflation" so even a little bad news can alarm investors.

A couple of inflation numbers have picked up recently, most notably the surprising 0.8 percent surge in the core Producer Price Index for finished goods in January. Bond traders also said that investors seemed to be worried that the February employment report, which will be released on Friday, will turn out to be stronger than expected, which could further raise inflationary fears. The current consensus forecast is for an increase of 225,000 jobs in February, according to Bloomberg News.

Another indicator, the Chicago Purchasing Managers index, which measures manufacturing activity in the Midwest, rose more than expected in February. Some investors believe that a sharp increase in this regional index foreshadows a sharp jump in the national index, which is to be released today.

Traders also said the selling yesterday was heightened by holders of large portfolios of mortgages. As rates rise and the chances for mortgage refinancing dim, many institutional investors sell the Treasury securities they had bought to hedge against a further fall in interest rates and more mortgage refinancing.

These developments will intensify the focus on Mr. Greenspan tomorrow, when he is scheduled to testify before the House Budget Committee. How confident he sounds about the inflation outlook could be hugely important for the near-term direction of interest rates.
