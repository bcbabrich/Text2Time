FORGET powder-pink puppies and baby-blue kittens. Night skies and kimono-clad bunnies are among today's wallpaper offerings for the toddler set -- or perhaps their parents. Judy Kennedy, a stylist at York Wallcoverings in York, Pa., sees nostalgia for the 1960's -- black lights and psychedelics -- as influencing children's decorating this year. Indeed, lava lamps inspired York's three-dimensional black-light-sensitive wallpaper.

Borders are also big now -- in scale and in popularity. Designers suggest hanging a border at chair-rail height on a painted wall. But with it at child's-eye level, could crayons be far behind? If your paper isn't precoated for washability, you can apply protective water-based polyurethane after it's on the wall.
