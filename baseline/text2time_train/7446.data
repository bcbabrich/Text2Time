A strike that would have shut down almost all Broadway theaters today was prevented last night when Mayor Wagner succeeded in getting actors and producers to continue negotiations after their contract expired at midnight.

Following a meeting with representatives of Actors Equity Association and the League of New York Theaters at Gracie Mansion, Mr. Wagner announced at 8 P.M., “We have not been able to come to any agreement.” But he said that the two sides had agreed to his request that they extend negotiations for a new contract until 5 P.M. Thursday. Any settlement, said the Mayor, will be retroactive to last midnight. The participants will hold their next joint session at Equity's offices today at 10:30 A.M.

The union, according to Frederick O'Neal, president of Equity, is seeking a 14 per cent increase over the present weekly minimum wage of $117.50 and rehearsal pay equal to the minimum. The rehearsal pay is now $97.50 a week. The increase would bring minimum salaries over four years to $150.

Mr. Wagner's personal intervention in the negotiations came in the form of two ses‐ sions at his East Side home. At 1:10 P.M., he met with Equity and league spokesmen for less than an hour.
