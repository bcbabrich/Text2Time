FORT A.P. HILL, Va., July 31 - President Bush drew cheers on Sunday from a crowd of tens of thousands of Boy Scouts and their parents with talk about patriotism, morals and the role of their organization in creating leaders.

Mr. Bush, in a 17-minute speech on the last day of the scouts' national jamboree, introduced himself as a former Cub Scout.

The president said that several senior members of his administration had been scouts. He praised the virtues of scouting and listed all those in the Boy Scout law.

"Through the generations, scouts have made America a stronger and better nation," Mr. Bush said.
