THE MERE WIFE

The Anglo-Saxon epic “Beowulf” has a historic place in English literature. But how much contemporary cultural resonance does it have? Plenty, Maria Dahvana Headley suggests in her new novel, “The Mere Wife” — if you mess around with it enough.

Quick recap of “Beowulf”: A monster named Grendel is slaughtering the denizens of Heorot, a Danish feudal stronghold, on a nightly basis. From across the Kattegat, a warrior called Beowulf arrives with his comrades-in-arms, offering to save them. In battle, he defeats Grendel, wrenching off the monster’s shoulder and arm as proof of his victory. Problem solved? Not quite. Grendel’s vengeful mother soon ravages Heorot. But Beowulf tracks her down beneath the burning/freezing waters of a “mere,” where he kills her and beheads the corpse of her son. Later in his life, in his own land, Beowulf confronts a troublemaking dragon. Both die.

The action is gory and the monsters colorful, especially the dragon. The do-gooding hero is also keen for riches and fame, and he’s not subtle about it. Headley (whose previous books include “Magonia” and “Queen of Kings”) isn’t the first writer to approach this tale from the monster’s point of view; John Gardner’s 1971 novel, “Grendel,” did the same. But “The Mere Wife” brings the story into the 21st century in a curious way.

Here, the mother of Grendel’s counterpart, Gren, is a traumatized American veteran, Dana Mills, who inexplicably escapes from a hostage situation after her beheading is broadcast to the world. She’s six months pregnant from an encounter she doesn’t remember. Once she returns to the United States and gives birth, she and her son take refuge in the caverns of a mountain with an abandoned railway station at its heart and a sulfurous lake at its foot (once the site of a hot-springs resort). During her absence, an upscale gated community, Herot Hall, has sprung up on her old stamping grounds.
