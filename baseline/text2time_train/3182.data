Democracy's Documents

George Washington's first inaugural address. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. The deed of gift of the Statue of Liberty. These are among the 27 documents in ''American Originals: Treasures From the National Archives,'' opening on Friday at the New York Public Library. On view through Jan. 5, the documents shed light on historic figures like Susan B. Anthony, Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The fragile Emancipation Proclamation, which has rarely left Washington, will be displayed only from Nov. 16 through 19. Information: (212) 869-8089.

Seeing Double

When a community gets not one but two museums on a single day, both designed by an eminent architect, that amounts to something special. Sunday is the day. The Venetian Resort-Hotel-Casino in Las Vegas is the place. The architect is Rem Koolhaas, winner of the 2000 Pritzker Prize. One museum is the Hermitage Guggenheim, 7,600-square feet for the exhibition of works from the Guggenheim Foundation in New York and the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. The second is the Guggenheim Las Vegas, 63,700-square-feet for large-scale exhibitions. The Guggenheim Hermitage opens with ''Masterpieces and Master Collectors: Impressionist and Early Modern Paintings From the Hermitage and Guggenheim Museums.'' The Guggenheim Las Vegas opens with ''The Art of the Motorcycle.'' Information: (702) 414-2440.
