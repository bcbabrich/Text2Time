India's economy soared 10.4 percent in the final quarter of 2003, making it one of the fastest growing in the world, even ahead of China.

The last quarter's rise, up from an 8.4 percent pace in the previous quarter, was driven mainly by an expansion of nearly 17 percent in farm output. Last season, the country benefited from the heaviest monsoon rains in over a decade. Farming accounts for a quarter of India's economy.

The Center for Monitoring of the Indian Economy, based in Mumbai, said in its monthly review released Wednesday that overall gross domestic product, earlier forecast at around 8 percent, would probably be above 9 percent in the government's fiscal year ending this month.

But the jump, which makes India the fastest-growing Asian economy, is unlikely to continue.

''I would not get too excited about the double digits because there is a big skew in farm output this year which is unlikely to repeat,'' said Jyotivardhan Jaipuria, head of research at DSP Merrill Lynch.
