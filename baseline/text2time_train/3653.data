But when a company like Hotmail, with no real revenue to speak of, is sold for $400 million, other companies may feel like failures in comparison -- even when they are sold for three to five times the amount their investors put into them.

In the pre-Internet days, a return of five times invested capital would have been terrific. But venture capitalists like myself will be judged not only by the absolute dollars we return to our investors, or the internal rate of return on the capital invested, but against our peers, many of whom have seen $2 million investments turn into $1 billion in value in three to five years -- thanks to those runaway stock prices.

This unrealistic comparison threatens the foundations of one of the most remarkable constructs of a capitalist economy. The business of venture capital, providing growth financing to entrepreneurs in exchange for equity in fledgling or semi-established companies, can be a superb engine of economic growth, creating an enormous number of jobs and fueling an entrepreneurial spirit essential to a healthy economy.

But when a company with no visible means of support, let alone a plan to generate revenue, sells for $400 million, even normally sharp-witted venture capitalists lose their minds. In a mad scramble, they start outbidding each other to provide capital to what they hope will be the next Hotmail. So what? Who gets hurt? The entrepreneurs.

I know one chief executive who has worked day and night for three years to build his Internet software company. He has suffered through all of the dysfunction and pain of nurturing a start-up. This year, in the first full year of selling his product, his company is the No. 1 or No. 2 player in the market (depending on which research report you believe), he has more than 1,200 customers and has expected annual revenues of $3.5 million to $4 million. And, he may turn cash flow positive sometime in the fall. Not bad by anyone's measure, right? Wrong.

He thinks he has failed. Given the economics of the software industry, the likely exit scenario for this company is a sale to another software company. The likely price will be somewhere just below $50 million. But if that happens, the chief executive told me, he will have failed.

And so will his investors. After three or fours years of work, he will walk away with ''only'' $2 million to $3 million. And the investors will see a return of ''only'' 200 percent to 300 percent. So to avoid the perceived failure, he will probably choose to hang on longer than he should in pursuit of a market that simply may not be big enough to support his enterprise as a stand-alone company. And he and his investors, instead of cashing in, will sit at the table too long and possibly walk away with nothing.

John Doerr, a much better-known and wealthier venture capitalist than I, is often quoted as saying that the Internet represents the greatest legal creation of wealth in history. So far, Internet stocks seem to be proving him right. For my part, I just hope he is not the yardstick against which we will all be measured.
