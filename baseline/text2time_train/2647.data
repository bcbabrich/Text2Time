Seven Afghan soldiers were killed in an attack by suspected Taliban members on an American base in Zabul Province, in the southeast, the provincial governor, Khial Muhammad Husseini, said. The attack followed a clash on Tuesday when Taliban supporters attacked a district office in the province, killing three soldiers. Eight Taliban members also died in the firefight. The attacks were a sign of the Taliban's intent to disrupt the Oct. 9 elections, the governor said. Carlotta Gall (NYT)
