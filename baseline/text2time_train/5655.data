Yet whether such a course will succeed is uncertain amid growing Congressional calls for Mr. Reagan to provide more information on the secret dealings and for a special prosecutor to be appointed.

In recent days, aides to Mr. Reagan, including Donald T. Regan, the chief of staff, have operated as if they were under siege. As he vacationed with the President in Santa Barbara, Mr. Regan became visibly irritated as reporters questioned him about the Iran dealings at every oppportunity. He also did not make himself available for major interviews.

White House officials said Mr. Regan had hoped that the President would be seen as moving openly and speedily to tackle the crisis when he instructed Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d to begin an investigation and also announced that he would name a special commission to examine the role of the National Security Council.

At the same time, they said, there had been hope that the combined moves would help overcome any perception that the President was trying to cover up what occurred. 'It Is Not Going Away'

''Look, we know that it is not going away,'' he said. ''All we can do is to respond openly, honestly and immediately and hope people appreciate and understand how were are handling things,'' a senior Reagan aide said.

Much of Mr. Regan's advice on how Mr. Reagan should be handling the issue is based on a belief that so many unanswered questions exist that it is virtually impossible to engage in damage control.

''There are two elements at work here,'' another White House official said. ''It's hard to do what amounts to damage control without a full appreciation of the issue. I think think there is a genuine absence of facts and thus the possibility of an erroneous response is high.''
