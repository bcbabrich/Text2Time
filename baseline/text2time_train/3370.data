City personal income tax cuts first proposed nearly a year ago are finally making their way toward reality, with a City Council committee yesterday approving a scaled-back cut that would save city taxpayers only about $190 million a year, about a quarter of the original plan.

The city tax cut, when combined with an already planned state-financed reduction in the local income tax, would result in a combined savings of about $327 next year for a two-child family with an annual income of $100,000. For a single taxpayer earning $25,000 a year, it would translate into about $73 in savings over all.

The city tax cut approved by the Council committee yesterday is tentatively set to go into effect Jan. 1, and has already been approved by the State Legislature and endorsed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. It still needs to go before the full Council, which is expected to approve the measure.

''The city has enjoyed an incredible fiscal recovery, and now it's time to return some of that money back to our taxpayers,'' Peter F. Vallone, the Council speaker, said yesterday.
