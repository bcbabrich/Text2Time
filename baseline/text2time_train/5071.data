Despite the encouraging findings, the report warned that drug use is still rampant in high schools, with 39 percent of the students saying they used some illicit drug in 1988, and 54 percent saying they had tried such drugs at least once in their lifetime. The 39 percent is a decline from 42 percent in 1987, and 54 percent in 1979, the peak year.

As part of the study, about 1,200 college students who had taken the survey when they were in high school were also surveyed. The researchers found a similar pattern in declining drug use among those older students.

Titled ''Monitoring the Future: A Continuing Study of the Lifestyles and Values of Youth,'' this 14th annual survey has been one of the nation's major sources of data on drug abuse. Although it was administered confidentially by University of Michigan researchers, there is no way to judge whether the respondents were fully candid.

The study does not taken into account high school dropouts, who make up an estimated 15 percent of the target age group. ''We really can't say with much certainty whether a similar decline in crack use is occurring among the high school dropout segment of the population,'' Mr. Johnston said, noting that crack use is widespread among that population, particularly in inner cities. Marijuana Use Still Falling

The study did not include drug use trends in specific cities or among specific racial groups. Mr. Johnston said he was still completing a fuller report that might include such data.

Among other findings about high school seniors were these:

* Marijuana use continued its long-term decline, falling from 11 percent in 1978 to 3 percent in 1988.

* The use of hallucinogens, stimulants, tranquilizers, opiates other than heroin and nitrite inhalants all declined by statistically significant amounts last year. The number of seniors who say they have tried heroin at least once in their life remained at less than 1 percent percent after a decine a decade ago.
