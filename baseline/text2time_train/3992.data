No.

"You did not go through the proper channels for this request," replied Director Wang Shibang, a senior officer in the Fujian Province Public Security Bureau. "We were told that you were here to discuss immigration problems. If you want something else, you should go through proper channels."

Captain Duke, on his first trip to China, was mystified by this kind of round-in-a-circle language, since he had asked from day one to meet local Fuzhou police. Two Chinese-American police officers on the trip, Sgt. Douglas Lee and Det. Hayman Goon, were equally at a loss.

It was anyone's guess whether Director Wang was under orders from Beijing to block any new meetings, or was afraid to let even a small ray of sunlight into the murky operations of a police force that was a target of a corruption probe two years ago, or was just being a bureaucrat.

At a final dinner, Captain Duke and Director Wang sat next to each other, but did not exchange a single sentence in an hour-long meal. Director Wang resisted when an American took a photo of those at the table, finally agreeing, but then changing his mind and demanding that the unexposed film be handed over. It was.

Captain Duke said later that, despite the frustrations, the trip had been worthwhile. If a single life is saved through future cooperation between the two sides, he said, that would justify the effort and cost, under $20,000, shouldered by the N.Y.P.D.

"We came, we saw, we asked, we didn't get," said Captain Duke, 55, a beefy, gray-at-the-temples man, over a Tsingtao beer at a hotel bar where he and his colleagues spent their last evening chuckling about the week's misadventures. "That's life. It's their system here, their rules."

Although they could not be sure, Captain Duke and his colleagues said they sensed that many of the police officials they met were nervous about setting up any formal cooperation with an American police department without a formal protocol or treaty.
