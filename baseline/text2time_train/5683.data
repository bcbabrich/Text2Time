Fear that a world war will break out in the next decade is dramatically declining in Western Europe, according to a recent public-opinion poll conducted for the European Commission, the Common Market's executive body. A similar trend has been found in the United States.

Only 13 percent of the West Europeans polled, down from 34 percent in 1980, indicated they felt a world war was probable within 10 years, according to a consortium of European polling companies headed by Jacques-Rene Rabier, special counselor to the European Economic Community.

Last fall, from Oct. 2 to Nov. 4, 9,911 people were interviewed in the 10 Common Market countries and were asked to estimate the chances of a war in the next decade on a scale that began at 0 and moved by tens to 100.

Two percent indicated that war was certain, by marking the 100 box, and 11 percent chose numbers from 90 down to 60, the level Mr. Rabier and his associates interpret as meaning that a respondent thinks war is probable. Twelve percent picked 50. In 1983, 19 percent gave a rating of 60 or higher.
