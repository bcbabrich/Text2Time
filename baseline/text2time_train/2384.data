To the Editor:

The death of Terri Schiavo brings to a close a critical chapter in an exceptionally sad and tawdry piece of the history of our nation.

What should have been a private, intimate matter was turned into a publicity-crazed, history-making event, one from which we are likely to have great difficulty recovering.

Skilled medical experts charged with Ms. Schiavo's care were in general agreement that her physical state was such that her existence was one of hopelessness. Their diagnosis and conclusion were not found to be acceptable by some individuals who have appointed themselves our moral arbiters.

Ms. Schiavo and her loving, well-intentioned parents were exploited by the media and by conniving elected officials, mostly my fellow Republicans, much to my shame and theirs.
