Assistant principals from School Districts 2 and 19 will study budgeting, data systems and other management topics in a pilot program that will train them as chief operating officers to free principals to focus on academic issues. The 12-month program, which starts next month and will be run by the City University of New York, will involve faculty members from Baruch College's School of Public Affairs and the Schools of Education at Brooklyn and Hunter Colleges. It is financed in part by a $50,000 grant from the Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund. EDITH EVERETT, the former vice chairwoman of the CUNY board of trustees, helped develop the pilot and is assembling an advisory group to evaluate it and expand it to include all New York City school leadership. NICHOLAS MICHELLI, CUNY's dean for teacher education, will direct the project. Karen W. Arenson
