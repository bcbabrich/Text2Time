TRACK AND FIELD

As the Games' showcase sport resumed after an off day, Sergei Bubka dropped out of the pole vault with an injury, the second straight Olympic disappointment for him, and Gail Devers failed in her effort to get a second gold, finishing fourth in the 100-meter hurdles. Lyudmila Engquist of Sweden took the gold. Deon Hemmings became the first Jamaican woman to earn an Olympic gold with a surprise victory in the 400-meter hurdles. Dan O'Brien opened his pursuit of decathlon redemption by taking the early lead, and Michael Johnson kicked into gear in the 200 preliminaries.
