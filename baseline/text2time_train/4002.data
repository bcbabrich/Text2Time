They told us that national health care would deprive us of the right to choose our own doctors.

So we said no to national health care.

And we found ourselves enrolled in something called an H.M.O. It gave you a list of doctors to choose from. If your doctor wasn't listed, they told you to forget him.

They told you to choose one of the doctors on the H.M.O.'s list, or else. "Or else" meant your health insurance wouldn't pay your doctor's bill.

They had deprived us of the right to choose our own doctors.

And they told us if we had national health care there would be Government bureaucrats interfering with our medical treatment.
