That’s where the notion of value comes in. With these wines, you are not paying a premium for famous names or for the high status of their appellations. Nonetheless, they are not cheap. You could easily find dozens of bottles from Bordeaux that are less expensive than these three.

So why these wines? Because value is not strictly a synonym for inexpensive. It means you are getting inordinate quality for the price, which I hope will be the case with these bottles. They are:

Château Aney Haut-Médoc 2013 (Kermit Lynch Wine Merchant, Berkeley, Calif.) $25

Château Moulin de Tricot Haut-Médoc 2013 (Rosenthal Wine Merchant, New York) $28

Château le Puy Emilien Francs Côte de Bordeaux 2013 (Rosenthal Wine Merchant) $42

These wines are produced in relatively small quantities, as is so often the case with good-value Bordeaux. If you cannot find them, you could select any recent Bordeaux in this price range. Other names to look for include Peybonhomme les Tours, Auney, Moulin Pey-Labrie, Lanessan, Jean Faux, La Peyre, Milon and Peyredon, just to name a few.

I should say that the 2013 vintage is not considered among the best, though I generally think that we pay too much attention to vintages. Yes, vintage conditions affect the character of the wine, and occasionally the price, though not much for wines as relatively inexpensive as these. But it’s always more interesting to see what a good producer does with a mediocre vintage than it is to prioritize the vintage.

That said, if you see wines from these producers in other recent vintages, by all means snap them up.
