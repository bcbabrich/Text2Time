To the Editor:

Re ''Warming Up to Patients' Rights'' (editorial, June 29): We agree that the Republican leadership inserted some poison pills into its patient protection plan. Although the American Medical Association has long supported medical malpractice limits on pain and suffering awards as well as medical savings accounts, we do not support their inclusion in any patient protection legislation. We will fight that battle on another day.

We support the Dingell-Daschle bill because it addresses five objectives: information disclosure for patients, an independent appeals process, a method for holding health plans accountable for medical decision-making, a prudent-layperson definition for access to emergency services and termination of physician gag policies.
