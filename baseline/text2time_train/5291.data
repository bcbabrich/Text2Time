Soybean, grain, sugar and cotton prices rebounded yesterday as forecasters warned that the Midwest faced a new siege of hot and dry weather.

Livestock prices were mixed, with the nearby delivery contracts falling on expections that higher feed costs will lead to increased liquidation of herds. The 1989 futures rose on the belief that meat supplies would be much tighter next year following the expected liquidation.

Elsewhere, crude oil prices continued to plunge, with the spot August delivery down 27 cents a barrel, to $15.16, and the July unleaded gasoline futures falling 0.68 cent a gallon, to 51.94 cents. The gasoline price went against the seasonal trend; prices usually rise during the summer, as driving increases.

The Commodity Research Bureau index of futures prices, an inflation barometer, also rebounded, rising 4.36, to 265.07 of its 1967 base of 100. The spot July C.R.B. futures, traded on a subsidiary of the New York Stock Exchange, closed up 2.90, at 262.00.
