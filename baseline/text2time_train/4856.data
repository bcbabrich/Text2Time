After the war, he went to California, to the Actors' Laboratory, which included many people from the Group Theater. After two years, he became managing director of the lab, graduating in 1948. The lab, however, split apart because of political disputes: Many of his colleagues, he wrote, were members of the Communist Party.

Back in New York, Mr. Papp began working as a television stage manager for CBS. He changed his name from Papirofsky to Papp because, he said, Papirofsky was too long to fit on the television screen during the credits. In 1954, in a church on the Lower East Side, the Emmanuel Presbyterian Church, he began staging free Shakespeare.

In 1956, he received the backing of the New York City Parks Department and its commissioner, Moses, and moved his free Shakespeare to the 2,000-seat East River Park Amphitheater on the Lower East Side. The season was produced for about $20,000, a figure that eventually expanded to the $16 million it cost to keep the Public Theater afloat in 1987. (Recession cutbacks brought the budget down to $10.5 million this year.)

That first season, there were two productions, first "Julius Caesar," directed by Stuart Vaughan, which opened on June 29, 1956, and then "The Taming of the Shrew." The casts performed without pay, and included, as the shrew, the young Colleen Dewhurst.

The next year, what was becoming the New York Shakespeare Festival Company toured the five boroughs with a mobile theater, then settled in Central Park, by West 81st Street near the Belvedere Castle, on the site that would later become its permanent summer home, the Delacorte Theater.

In 1958, Mr. Papp, who had continued working for CBS, was called before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. He denied that he had been a member of the Communist Party after June 1955, but he took the Fifth Amendment and declined to say anything about his activities before that date. CBS dismissed him, but he was reinstated after an arbitration ruling, the first person to be rehired by a television network after having been let go because of testimony before the House committee.

Mr. Papp had his famous battle with -- and victory over -- Moses in 1959. As Robert A. Caro tells it in "The Power Broker," his biography of Moses, it was Stuart Constable, Moses's top aide, who started the dispute while Moses was on vacation. What happened, Mr. Caro wrote, was this: Constable, who was politically very much on the right, found out about Mr. Papp's testimony -- or lack of it -- and became upset at the idea of a leftist producing Shakespeare for the masses. He decided that Mr. Papp would have to go and told the producer there would be no more Shakespeare unless the public was charged a fee. Mr. Papp refused. When Moses returned, he upheld his aide's decision.
