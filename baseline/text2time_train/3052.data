QUEENS: MAN STABBED AT PARTY

A 21-year-old man was in critical but stable condition yesterday after he was stabbed on the dance floor at a party at an Elks Lodge, the police said. The authorities said the man, whose name was not immediately released because his family had not been notified, was admitted to Elmhurst Hospital Center after he was stabbed five times in the stomach at 11:43 p.m. Saturday. The stabbing took place at the Elks Lodge at 82-10 Queens Boulevard in Elmhurst. The police said yesterday that the party had been private, not sponsored by the Elks. Elissa Gootman (NYT)

Lobbying disclosure rules that have applied to lobbyists on the state level for two decades are being extended to the local level starting today.

Those who lobby New York City government officials have had to report their expenses four times a year to the city's clerk for more than a decade, but now they will also have to report the same expenses to the state's lobbying commission six times a year.
