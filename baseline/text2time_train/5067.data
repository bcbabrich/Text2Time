The United Mine Workers today dropped a strike that had been scheduled for midnight against Pittston Coal Group and said 1,700 miners would continue working without a contract.

The union said, however, it would expand efforts to pressure the company through protests and other actions. Richard L. Trumka, the union president, called for a boycott of Crestar Financial Corporation because of a loan the Virginia-based concern gave Pittston in 1987. A Crestar spokesman called the union's action unfair.

Pittston Coal Group of Lebanon, Va., is a subsidiary of The Pittston Company of Greenwich, Conn.
