But there are also indications that the scandal reaches far beyond the Dominican Republic. Traditionally the numbers drawn here each week also serve as winners for a private lottery in neighboring Haiti and for illegal lotteries that operate in Venezuela, Curacao and also among some of the million or so Dominican immigrants estimated to be living in the New York metropolitan region.

Dominican Government officials said the ring had agents in all those locations who were given winning numbers in advance. In New York City, the agents placed wagers in dollars on those numbers at Dominican-owned bodegas throughout Manhattan and the Bronx, but often encountered resistance when they went to collect winnings from store owners suspicious of their repeated good fortune.

''It is clear that some bodegas in New York City were burned down as a result of the refusal of their owners to pay up, probably by police officers sent up there to collect,'' said a Dominican Government official involved in the investigation who insisted on anonymity. ''We also have reason to suspect that several people were killed in New York City for refusing to pay off, and we are going to be talking to the American authorities about that.''

Nine people have been arrested, among them Frederick Marzouka, a Haitian businessman who said on Ms. Piera's program that he had been a ''bagman'' for the ring, keeping a 30 percent cut of the winning bets that he placed. Also charged is Col. Manuel Cruz Madera, an aide to the former Chief of the National Police, Gen. Camilo Nazir Tejada, who was replaced last year for undisclosed reasons after the first allegations of irregularities had surfaced.

''There are a lot of authorities involved in this mess,'' Mr. Marzouka said in a television interview in which he displayed an identification card signed by ''my good friend'' General Nazir Tejada that designated Mr. Marzouka as an agent of the ''secret service'' of the Dominican police. ''They were using me as a front, and now I'm the scapegoat.''

Not long after his arrest Mr. Marzouka escaped from a medical clinic where he was being detained and fled to the United States, which led to the firing of the director of the national prison system, Bernardo Santana Paez. Dominican officials said that Mr. Marzouka had been living in the Miami region and that an extradition request had been filed.

In an effort to restore public confidence, President Fernandez appointed Taina Gautreau de Windt as the new lottery director in March, rewarding her for her effort to clean up the Dominican immigration service. In an interview Ms. Gautreau said the Government had taken ''a series of corrective measures'' aimed at ''rescuing the credibility and transparency'' of the lottery.
