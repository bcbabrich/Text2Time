WASHINGTON — Republicans, with justification, shouted “hypocrisy” last week after former White House aides opened a campaign organization using the sort of anonymous donors condemned by President Obama.

But they also understood it as a compliment. That’s because, in another springtime full of political disappointment, Democratic strategists have begun concluding that Mr. Obama faces a tougher-than-anticipated re-election fight.

Just as signs of economic recovery last year faded with the Greek financial crisis and the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the drop in unemployment and a rise in stock values to start off 2011 have been offset by higher gas prices and turmoil in Washington and abroad. Even as a flawed, boisterous group of Republican presidential challengers struggles for traction, Mr. Obama’s own poll standing has drifted down — to 46 percent in the most recent New York Times/CBS News poll.

“The significant challenges that President Obama will face are being masked by the weakness of the Republican field right now,” said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster.

Mr. Garin is advising Priorities USA, the new political group Republicans criticized. He believes that Democratic activists and donors, chuckling lately over the antics of

Donald J. Trump and other Republicans, need a wakeup call.

“It’s not just, Obama needs to run hard,” Mr. Garin said. “Democrats have to take this seriously.”

The Shadow of 2008

Americans have voted for change in each of the last three national elections. And though the economy has recovered somewhat from the financial crisis Mr. Obama inherited, it has done so slowly and unevenly.

The unemployment rate has fallen from its double-digit peak, but remains high at 8.8 percent; the economy grew in the first quarter of this year, but only at a 1.8 percent annualized rate. The most recent New York Times/CBS News poll showed Americans more downbeat about the country’s direction than they have been since the early weeks of Mr. Obama’s administration.

“In a way, Obama’s biggest obstacle to overcome in 2012 is Obama 2008,” said Rachel Gorlin, a Democratic consultant. Voters “just get this overall impression of things being out of control, that change hasn’t happened. It’s going to be one of the toughest runs for an incumbent president and his party in a long time.”

The national economy is Mr. Obama’s biggest problem, but not his only one. Voters link increases in gas prices to the upheaval in the Middle East, as Libya follows Iraq and Afghanistan on the list of American military commitments.

The political brinkmanship that threatened a government shutdown before Mr. Obama and Republican lawmakers compromised on spending cuts underscored the sense of disorder in government. So has warfare in state capitals over budget problems mirroring Washington’s.

Voters “lump it all into: everything’s a mess, and people in politics can’t govern,” said Bill Carrick, a Democratic strategist in California. On Mr. Obama, “they’re still trying to figure out what kind of leader he is.

“Is he effective? They haven’t made up their minds on that.”

Rallying the Base

Congressional reapportionment after the 2010 census has already taken six electoral votes from states Mr. Obama carried. But the breadth of his 2008 victory gives Democrats some encouragement.

Even if the president cannot repeat his breakthroughs in Florida, Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia, he could win a 273-vote electoral majority by holding all of the other states he carried.

The White House counts on Republican overreaching to help do that, despite the struggling economy. By highlighting partisan differences on immigration, Democratic strategists see the possibility of expanding Mr. Obama’s 67 percent showing among Hispanics, which helped deliver Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico in 2008.

The House Republicans’ plan to transform Medicare provides an opening to regain ground among senior citizens, who helped erase the Democrats’ House majority last November. Challenges to organized labor by Republican state leaders like Gov.

Scott Walker of Wisconsin have alarmed a crucial element of the Democratic base.

And yet Democrats still see Wisconsin, which Republicans have lost in six straight presidential elections, as a battleground.

After carrying the state by 13 percentage points in 2008, “Obama should be doing enormously better there,” Ms. Gorlin said. “It being in play means he can’t take anything for granted.”

Ms. Gorlin worked on a recent Wisconsin Supreme Court election in which Democrats counted on a backlash against Mr. Walker to propel a powerful turnout. But Republicans’ turnout was also impressive; their candidate leads in the recount.

That experience foreshadows the burden facing Democrats across the industrial Midwest and elsewhere in reviving some semblance of the 2008 enthusiasm they capitalized on among young voters, African-Americans and suburban women.

“This election is still going to be defined by how events unfold over the next year and a half, more than by anything we know for sure today,” Mr. Garin said. “The idea that it’s over before it starts, in these circumstances, is crazy.”
