The nation's central bank said today that it is conducting an investigation into accusations that several domestic and foreign financial institutions used inside information about an impending shift in exchange-rate policy in January to profit from the devaluation of the currency.

The assertions -- first made public in February by Aloizio Mercadante, a member of Congress from the opposition Workers Party -- include charges that nine banks used access to Government officials in the days leading up to the Jan. 13 policy shift to make trading decisions resulting in a combined profit of roughly $1 billion. The list of banks includes Citigroup, J. P. Morgan and BankBoston.

Many banks in recent weeks have reported preliminary results to the central bank showing they made substantial profits after the devaluation of the currency, the real, largely through a combination of successful bets in futures markets and purchases of dollar-linked Government bonds. The enormous size of these profits comes as the economy is struggling with recession, and has resulted in calls by several members of Congress to look into the legality of such financial results.

This week, Senator Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, the president of the Senate and a man widely considered Brazil's most powerful legislator, said he would support a Congressional inquiry into the accusations that some banks used inside information to profit from the devaluation. That move is separate from the central bank's investigation.
