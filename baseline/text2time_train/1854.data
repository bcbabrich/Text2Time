An internal review by the inspector general of the federal Department of Justice is sharply critical of how the department has administered federal death benefits for police and firefighters. The review focuses on the work of the department’s Bureau of Justice Assistance, the agency that has denied claims by the families of two auxiliary police officers who were killed a year ago by a gunman in Greenwich Village, provoking protests from city and federal officials.



It was not immediately clear what influence the review would have on the cases of the New York auxiliary officers, Nicolas T. Pekearo and Yevgeniy Marshalik, who were killed on March 14, 2004.

Senator Charles E. Schumer, one of several officials to speak on behalf of the officers’ families, said the review confirmed a “sad reality,” that “time and again, lawyers for the Justice Department have tied themselves in a knot to avoid giving families the benefits owed to them.”

The review focused mainly on the administration of death benefits to law enforcement officers who die of heart attacks or strokes in the line of duty, which were authorized by Congress in the 2003 Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits Act. That act amended an earlier law, the Public Safety Officers Benefits Act, that was intended to provide benefits to those who are killed battling fires, by criminal gun fire or other unnatural causes.

The department took 33 months to develop guidelines for new claims after the 2003 amendments were enacted, the review said, and amassed a large backlog of unprocessed claims. By last August, an analysis by The Times found that it had processed 52 claims, approving only 42, and was processing about 200 more.

In a report on its internal review, the Justice Department said today that claims processing had been hastened somewhat, and the criterion for approval had loosened. As of Nov. 29, it said, 112 claims had been processed, and 47 approved.

Nonetheless, a report on the review concludes that the department should “establish more definitive performance guidelines.”

In denying the claims of the families of Officers Pekearo and Marshalik, which would be about $300,000 each, the Justice Department said the auxiliary officers did not qualify because they did not have arrest powers. Both families have appealed, and appeared last week at a hearing before a Department of Justice in Manhattan. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly also spoke on their behalf.

The department said the appeal remains under consideration.
