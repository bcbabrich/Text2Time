Some see it as the rebirth of the belle epoque style; others detect links to 19th-century dandyism; still others regard it as divine decadence. Regardless, traditional decorating seems to be changing course, and nowhere is the shift more evident than in the fabrics that are currently turning decorators' heads.

Unlike the American and English country styles that have been so popular in recent years, the new old-look is not characterized by innocent little prints, pretty ''bedroom'' colors or grandmotherly flowered chintz. It is more opulent, more daring, more masculine, more French - far more evocative of Beau Brummell than Miss Marple or Betsy Ross.

Decorators say that they are using more paisleys, more velvets, more tassels, braid and fringe. '' 'Amusing' fabrics are also very big,'' says Sam Watters, a decorator who has done most of his work in the traditional mode.

Indeed, in the for-the-trade-only showrooms this winter, things are seldom what they seem. Cottons have been printed to resemble everything from horsehair to leopard skin to silk moire. Canvas has been given hand-painted finishes suggestive of marble, gemstones and peau de soie. Chintz, a perennial favorite among traditionalists, is more likely to look like the endpapers of a well-bound book than a bower at the height of bloom.
