HERO--Alexander Byron, died suddenly on Thanksgiving Day. He is survived by his parents, Byron and Camille, and sister, Gabrielle. Born March 10, 1991, he was a 2010 graduate of The Hill School, where he was President of the School, winner of the Award for Excellence in Leadership, and Captain of the Varsity Soccer and Baseball teams. He graduated from Amherst College in 2014, where he majored in religion and helped lead the Amherst baseball team to four record-setting seasons. Alexander's life was defined by emotion. He was passionate about sports, fought for fairness and railed against injustice, cherished his many friends and teammates, and, most of all, was lovingly devoted to his father, mother and sister. A memorial service celebrating his life will be held at noon on Saturday, December 6, at The River Club, 447 East 52nd Street, NY, NY 10022. In his memory, contributions to the Alexander B. Hero Scholarship Fund at The Hill School, 717 East High Street, Pottstown, PA 19464, would be welcome. 1/3
