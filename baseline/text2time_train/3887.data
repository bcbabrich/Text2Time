Unemployment stands at 4.9 percent, and has touched a 23-year low of 4.8 percent several times this year. Many economists believe that sustained unemployment of less than 5.5 percent ultimately leads employers to raise wages to attract workers, leading in turn to higher prices as companies pass their higher labor costs along to consumers -- a phenomenon that has been noticeably absent in the economy this year.

Fed officials as well as most private economists have consistently forecast slowdowns in the economy over the last 18 months that have either not materialized or proved transitory. If there is no sign by the end of the year that the economy is cooling off, the pressure on the Fed to tighten policy by a notch is sure to grow, analysts said.

''They always see a slowdown around the corner or under way,'' said David Hensley, an economist at Salomon Brothers in New York.

There are only the faintest signs of even preliminary inflation pressures building. The rate at which factories are operating, for example, has been creeping upward and last month stood at 83.9 percent of capacity, just below the level economists consider an early warning signal of production bottlenecks that can lead to higher prices.

The Fed's policy-making committee met at the same time that the Senate Banking Committee began considering President Clinton's nominees to fill two vacancies on the seven-member Federal Reserve Board.

The nominees, Roger W. Ferguson Jr. and Edward M. Gramlich, both stressed in their testimony to the committee that they considered achieving price stability to be the Fed's primary mission. Their statements were unsurprising given that the Republican-controlled Senate would probably not be willing to confirm them if they did not publicly place price stability ahead of the Fed's other legislatively mandated mission, promoting maximum employment.

But both Mr. Ferguson, a specialist in banking and technology for the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, and Mr. Gramlich, dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, hinted that they saw the Fed as a pulpit to promote other goals as well.
