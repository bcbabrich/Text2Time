The upturn comes after nearly four years of layoffs and hiring freezes aimed at keeping state and local budgets in the black. Even after the recovery got rolling in 1983, these governments balked at hiring until they were sure of budget surpluses, says Laura Ruben, an economist for the Federal Reserve Board.

But an end to the hiring may be already be in sight. Mrs. Ruben says that a recent survey showed that state and local budget surpluses are shrinking. For some 28 states, surpluses will be less than 1 percent of expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 1986 -down from a comfortable 5 percent for 1985. The Almighty Yen? A stronger yen was a major goal of September's five-nation effort to force the dollar down against other currencies. During 1985's first two months, the currency had weakened to 250 yen to the dollar, which made Japanese imports even more attractive in the United States.

Now, says Wataru

Yamamoto, manager of foreign exchange at Fuju Bank Ltd. in New York, because of the intervention effort - selling dollars in the open market - and because Japan tightened its money supply, forcing up interest rates, the yen has strengthened 17 percent against the dollar in the past six weeks. The currency is now close to the 200-to-the-dollar level - where it has not been since early 1981 - and may even break this ''psychological barrier,'' said Mr. Yamamoto. But ''without continued intervention,'' he said, the yen ''would weaken to 230 to 240 by spring.'' Only lower interest rates in the United States or Japanese economic growth of better than 5 percent annually could keep the yen at about 200 otherwise, Mr. Yamamoto contends.

He considers the 200 mark to be an optimal one for both Japan and the United States: At stronger yen levels, he says, Japanese goods would become too expensive for Americans, and his nation's exports would be hit too hard. As it is now, a Japanese car that cost Americans $8,000 when the yen was at 260 will cost $10,400 with the yen at 200.

Gourmet Grazing

The new American craze of nibbling throughout the day - grazing, as it is called - has started to present a challenge for the nation's restaurateurs.
