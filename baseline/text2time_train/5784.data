Capital Goods

Although every quarter has its earnings surprises, it is virtually certain that results in the capital goods sector will be especially disappointing, analysts said. The makers of machine tools, engines, generators and other goods for production have borne the brunt of the high dollar, analysts said. They have also been hurt by the fact that ''real'' interest rates - the inflation-adjusted borrowing cost that many companies use to set spending - remain punitively high.

''For the third quarter, the volume of this industry was likely flat in terms of production,'' Walter Joelson, the chief economist at the General Electric Company, said. ''Any robustness we have seen in capital goods has been in defense and autos.''

Retailing is another trouble spot. Merchants have been enjoying a boom in unit volume as consumers have flocked to buy low-cost foreign goods. Another trend in the industry, however, is the increasing incidence of sales and other promotions, leading some in the industry to wonder whether the increased traffic through stores may be coming at the expense of reduced profit margins.

''The traditional department stores are caught in a price war,'' Thomas Langenfeld, a spokesman for the Dayton-Hudson Corporation, said, ''They are battling away at each other with markdowns.''

Computer Sales Slump

Computer makers have also been slashing their prices in the face of one of the worst sales slumps in their history. Most analysts believe that slide has continued in the quarter, although at a less steep rate. Still, some premier computer hardware concerns, including Apollo Computer Inc. and Apple Computer Inc., laid off employees during the period.

There are some bright spots in the earnings picture.

The chemical industry, for example, is enjoying an upturn in prices and is one of the few United States industries to enjoy a trade surplus - it exports more than it imports. Bank earnings are expected to benefit from the steady decline in interest rates, although the big international lenders could get hit soon by losses on Mexican loans because of the earthquake there.

Steelmakers, while continuing to suffer from surging imports and a flaccid market - conditions that analysts say will lead to losses in the current quarter - have announced price increases in recent weeks, some of which become effective tomorrow. If the increases stick, they should help eliminate losses in the future, analysts said.
