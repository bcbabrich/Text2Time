The Bush Administration told Congress today how it will distribute nearly $8 billion in United States foreign aid this year. In an indication of its shifting global priorities, the Administration plans a dramatic increase in aid to Poland and a sharp decrease in assistance to most of Central America, including El Salvador.

The overall amounts for the current fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, have already been appropriated by Congress, with more than 85 percent of the money earmarked for specific countries and the Administration given discretion in deciding how to spend the rest. No further action by Congress is needed.

The draft list of allocations, prepared by the State Department and sent to a few members of Congress today, shows that economic aid for El Salvador, $185 million last year, is being reduced to $130.6 million this year. Military aid will be $84.6 million, about the same as the $85 million last year.

The United States has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to the Salvadoran Government, and the Administration has vigorously resisted efforts by Congressional Democrats to reduce aid to El Salvador because of human rights abuses.
