ZULEIKHA

By Guzel Yakhina

Whenever I have taught Andrei Platonov’s hallucinatory masterpiece, “Soul,” a novella about the Soviet expansion into Central Asia, I’ve noticed that many of my otherwise knowledgeable undergraduates have only a vague idea of what happened in Eastern Europe between the Russian Revolution and the 1980s liberalizations of Glasnost. It often seems that the terror and mass murder orchestrated by Stalin and his henchmen have somehow acquired, at least in the West, a weirdly kitschy, ironic patina. In Manhattan, a charming bar called KGB hosts literary readings in a space decorated with Communist-era memorabilia; one can hardly imagine similar events in a swastika-festooned Cafe Gestapo. Nor can one envision Hitler’s final days in the bunker portrayed with the zany slapstick that animated Armando Iannucci’s 2017 film, “The Death of Stalin.”

As we watch its heroine’s existence devolve from an oppressive domestic servitude into something disastrously worse, Guzel Yakhina’s sprawling, ambitious first novel, “Zuleikha,” reminds us just how brutal the Soviet system was. A devout Muslim living in a Tatar village in the Kazan region, Zuleikha is married to the much older Murtaza and is in thrall to her blind and deaf mother-in-law, a sadistic bully Zuleikha thinks of as the Vampire Hag, who in turn refers to Zuleikha as “a pitiful hen.” Zuleikha begins her day by emptying the old woman’s chamber pot and — after gathering wood, feeding the livestock, cooking, cleaning and being beaten by Murtaza — is finally allowed to sleep on the tin trunk, studded with protruding nails, that serves as her bed. Having borne four daughters who died in infancy, Zuleikha is lonely and unhappy, but patient, submissive — and unable to imagine a life significantly better or worse than her own.

Among her unpleasant duties is the task of hiding food from the Red Army soldiers who periodically arrive to raid the family larder: “At first they collected only grain. Then potatoes and meat. And during the Great Famine, in 1921, they began making a clean sweep of everything edible. Poultry. Cattle. And everything they could find in the house.” Now the government has decreed that the kulaks — the wealthier peasants — need to be wiped out. Their land is to be seized and turned into collective farms, while the farmers are to be slaughtered or deported to prison camps.

“In the middle of February 1930, the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People’s Commissars of the Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic … approve the decree ‘On the liquidation of kulaks as a class in Tataria.’” When Murtaza refuses to surrender some seed grain to the cavalryman who demands them, he is shot and killed. Zuleikha — “as a kulak element of the first category. Active counterrevolutionary” — is evicted from her home and sent on the long, punishing journey that will occupy much of the novel.
