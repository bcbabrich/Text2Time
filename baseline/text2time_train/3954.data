STRING QUARTET NO. 13 (OP. 130). Vegh Quartet (Valois Auvidis V 4407).

PIANO SONATAS NOS. 28 TO 32; "DIABELLI" VARIATIONS; BAGATELLES (OP. 126). Artur Schnabel, pianist (Pearl GEMM CDS 9142; three CD's).

FIVE works, five Beethovens: the orchestral revolutionary of the "Eroica" Symphony, the choral-orchestral visionary of the Missa Solemnis, the generous lyricist of the "Archduke" Trio, the cryptic poet of the Opus 130 Quartet, the mercurial experimenter of the "Diabelli" Variations. Loyalty to my first musical love demands representation of the "Eroica," but otherwise my choices lean more toward the private, elusive sides of Beethoven's all-embracing personality.

For my money, Otto Klemperer remains the conductor of Beethoven. His life, an indomitable progress through mishaps and catastrophes, echoed Beethoven's own. The power that emanated from this towering, unbalanced, brilliant man is reflected in one of his finest EMI recordings, the Missa Solemnis. The trademark slow tempos, rocklike beats and oratorical phrasings are not merely an assertion of conductorial will. Klemperer's fundamental straightforwardness places the original score first and foremost. Power cancels itself out; burning belief in the music remains.

Klemperer's "Eroica" would have headed my list, but EMI has mystifyingly exiled it to a boxed set. In its place, I would recommend Toscanini's pulse-quickening live performance from 1939, reissued on an RCA mid-price disk. (Note also a strong "Eroica" in Herbert von Karajan's generally satisfying Beethoven cycle from 1963; Deutsche Grammophon's box of the nine symphonies can be had for $40 or less.)

Alfred Cortot, Jacques Thibaud and Pablo Casals, singing through the "Archduke" Trio, present a Beethoven vastly different from either Klemperer's or Toscanini's. Here music melts into civilized conversation, smiling asides, dreaming digressions. This is the world from which Schubert was born, and a buoyant reading of Schubert's B flat Trio logically follows. The 1928 recording is highly listenable in French EMI's digital transfer: the distinctive poetic qualities of each artist come through, with Casals's imperturbably noble tone at the heart of the sound.
