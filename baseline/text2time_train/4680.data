Gladys Merrifield, a poet and editor, died on Friday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 85 years old.

She died of emphysema, said her daughter, Gail Merrifield Papp.

Mrs. Merrifield, a native of Colton, Calif., received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of California at Berkeley, where she was awarded the Chamberlain Cook Prize in poetry, and did graduate studies at Columbia University. She was a staff writer and editor at Family Circle magazine from 1952 until the early 70's.

She published two volumes of poetry, "20th Reunion" (1984) and "Windows on Manhattan" (1986). Her work appeared in many poetry magazines and in two anthologies, "The Diamond Anthology" (1971) and "The View From the Top of the Mountain" (1982). In 1982, a selection of her work was read by Ruth Nelson as part of the Poets at the Public series at the Public Theater in New York City.

For her long narrative poem "The Roundabout Cafe: Manhattan," which formed part of "Windows on Manhattan," Mrs. Merrifield received the Robert Browning Award from the Robert Browning Society and the Mason Sonnet Award from the World Order of Narrative Poets.
