WHITE PLAINS, Oct. 2—The teachers who struck the Greenburgh schools in Westchester last month and returned Sept. 25 have learned that they will lose an average of $1,200 in fines.

The fines equal about twice the salary increase the teachers negotiated, but a teacher representative said the walkout, which involved 270 teachers earning an average income of $15,000, focused on job security and other nonsalary matters.

The teachers' financial losses could have been higher, based on two days of lost salary for each of the 13 days they were on strike. They will lose only 18 days wages, however, because of eight extra “make‐up” days now scheduled by the schools.

Letters informing the teachers of their salary deductions, which will begin in three weeks, were sent out a few days ago. The fining procedure is contained in the state's Taylor Law.
