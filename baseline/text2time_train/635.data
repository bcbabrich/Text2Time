A decade ago, central Paris around Rue du Sentier — a warren of covered passageways, intimate squares and narrow cobbled streets with names like Cairo, Aboukir and Nile reflecting the area’s development during the Napoleonic campaigns — was an insider destination for cut-rate fashion and accessories in the city’s garment district. Lately, it has morphed into “Silicon Sentier”: a petri dish of entrepreneurial innovation that includes a tech incubator in an old factory as well as a digital arts center and bars where tech workers gather for custom cocktails.
