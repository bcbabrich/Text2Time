''Because they say it is politics but it is not politics,'' he said. ''This is what we are.''

He added, ''The church cannot let itself die'' by giving up its advocacy of social justice. Church Report on Rights

The church in Chile has been harshly critical of the Pinochet Government since shortly after he took power in 1973 through a military coup that overthrew the Marxist Government of President Salvador Allende Gossens.

On Monday night, the church accused the Government of trampling on human rights and stepping up the use of torture against its opponents. The church's human rights organization said in a report that deaths from political violence rose 42 percent last year, reported cases of torture were up almost 30 percent and arrests on politically related charges increased nearly 25 percent.

''It shows, once again, the continuation of norms that do not favor human rights, of repeated complaints of attacks on personal liberty, of people's deaths in conditions of violence, of the use of torture and unnecessary violence against detainees,'' the report said.

Over the last 13 years, President Pinochet has justified repressive measures as necessary to defend the country from a Communist threat, most recently represented by a growing left-wing insurgency. System 'Currently Dictatorial'

Asked by a reporter today to compare the situations in Chile and in his native Poland, John Paul said, ''We are going to encounter a system which is currently dictatorial but which is transitory by its own definition.''

In Poland, he said, there are no signs that dictatorship will give way and so the struggle of the people there is ''much more demanding and difficult'' than in Chile.
