The documentary “Apollo 11” — playing in select IMAX theaters now, before opening more widely in regular cinemas on Friday — is one of the most rousing movies ever made about NASA and space exploration. The director Todd Douglas Miller and a team of archivists and editors found rare footage of the original manned lunar landing mission, and compiled it into a film that’s an immersive and inspiring record of the voyage, from launch to splashdown.

But “Apollo 11” is far from the only great documentary about humanity’s efforts to explore beyond Earth’s atmosphere. The “space doc” is a small but fertile nonfiction cinema subgenre, populated by filmmakers who often partner with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to combine astonishing images with recollections from the small handful of men and women who have dared to venture to the stars.
