The Chicago Board Options Exchange and some of its traders overcharged more than 1,000 investors who lost at least $40 million the day after the stock market collapsed, a lawyer contended today after filing a class action lawsuit.

The lawyer, Herbert Beigel, said the C.B.O.E. and floor traders responsible for making markets in certain options on the Standard & Poor's 100-stock index violated the law and the exchange's rules by charging inflated prices for options contracts last Oct. 20.

''The investors were gouged by virtue of being charged excessive prices,'' Mr. Beigel, a partner in the Chicago-based law firm Beigel & Sandler, said by telephone from his New York office.

Warren Moulds, a spokesman for the exchange, said its officials would not comment. The suit, filed Tuesday in Federal District Court here, combines the claims in three previous suits.
