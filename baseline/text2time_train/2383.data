To the Editor:

David Prerau ("Spring Forward Faster," Op-Ed, March 31) cites the benefits of extending the period of daylight saving time, but then proposes only a minor modification, adding two or three weeks per year.

His arguments are valid, but the logical conclusion, which I have long wished for, is to have daylight saving time year-round.
