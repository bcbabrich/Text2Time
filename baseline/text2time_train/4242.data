CBS will announce a deal with Bill Cosby today for his first new situation comedy since his "Cosby Show" was television's biggest hit in the 1980's.

The deal, which will reunite Mr. Cosby with the production team of Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner, is one of the biggest financial commitments made by a network in recent years, said a senior executive at a rival network. The agreement guarantees the new show a two-year run on CBS.

Executives at the network declined yesterday to discuss the terms of the deal, but they confirmed several details published yesterday in The Hollywood Reporter, the entertainment trade publication.

Mr. Cosby's new comedy, which will go on the air next fall, will be based on a British sitcom called "One Foot in the Grave," which concerns a curmudgeonly man's struggles with the irritations of everyday life after ending a professional career. More details of the deal and the series are scheduled to be announced today at a news conference at CBS.
