Mr. Kohl was described as likely to tell President Reagan that all possibilities for German involvement in the program are being ''constructively investigated.''

Quandary Over 'Star Wars'

United States officials have said that the summit meeting will produce no ''separate statement'' on the 'Star Wars' program, but other participants have said there might be a vague paragraph and a general declaration referring to the American offer of participation. A senior West German official commented, ''Something will have to be said.'' ''If we don't have an S.D.I. passage,'' the official added, ''that would mean that the summit had been a failure in the political area'' because the subject appeared too sensitive or too divisive to mention.

A series of other, noneconomic issues will be raised by the European and Japanese leaders.

In addition to their interest in hearing a report from President Reagan on the first months of the renewed negotiations on nuclear weapons between the United States and the Soviet Union in Geneva, the allies are expected to stress their backing for a meeting in the fall between Mr. Reagan and the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

West Germany, which is particularly attached to the appearance of relaxed relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, is likely to press that such a United States-Soviet summit meeting take place. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who has spent more time with Mr. Gorbachev than the other leaders, was also thought likely to urge Mr. Reagan to go ahead with plans for the meeting.

Mrs. Thatcher is also known to want the participants to make a further statement on terrorism, elaborating the one the seven leaders issued last year in London.

Varied Interests of Participants

Other participants will be seeking separate statements addressing the interests of their particular domestic or international constituencies.

Japan, for example, is believed to want a statement pointing to the continuing dangers of the division of Korea. The West Germans, who face sensitive environmental issues at home, have called for a discussion of efforts to coordinate protection of the environment.
