WASHINGTON, Sept. 30—The entire Social Security bill, including health insurance for the aged, was all but dead tonight, with Senate and House conferees unable to reconcile their differences. A decision to shelve both programs—health insurance and increases in cash benefits—could come at a meeting of conferees tomorrow.

However, if Congress agrees to recess until after the Nov. 3 election, a possibility raised tonight by an Administration leader, the decision to put off the Social Security bill might not be made formally until after the recess.

Some members of Congress, with close races on their hands, have said it would be difficult to justify to their elderly constituents a failure by Congress to provide any aid, either larger cash benefits or health insurance.

“We're at complete loggerheads,” Senator George A. Smathers, Democrat of Florida, one of the conferees, said late today. “We're standing firm and the House conferees won't: budge.”
