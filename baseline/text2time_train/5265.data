The concept - a free public boarding school specializing in science and mathematics for gifted high school students - has been in operation since 1980, when North Carolina opened the first such school.

But when Governor Cuomo suggested last year that New York State set up a similar school, the State Education Department and major education groups assailed it as elitist, costly and unnecessary.

The Governor had recommended that the school offer a two- or three-year curriculum and be on Long Island near high-technology companies. He induced the Legislature to budget $1 million to explore the idea, but the funds were never spent. The lawmakers declined later to approve a foundation to plan and run the school.

This year, Mr. Cuomo revived the idea, asking the Legislature to budget $1.5 million for preliminary planning. He has lost again. ''It was not included in the fiscal budget passed by the Legislature,'' notes Francis Sheehan, a press officer to the Governor.
