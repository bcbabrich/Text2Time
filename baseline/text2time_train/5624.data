Roger Hall, the head of United Airlines' pilots, is a man without many admirers these days.

To Donald C. Burr, the chairman of People Express Inc., Mr. Hall is the official of that ''unresponsive and inflexible'' union that drove the final nail into Frontier Airlines's coffin -and perhaps one or two into that of its ailing parent, People Express. Newark-based People had been trying to sell its money-losing Denver-based subsidiary to seal off a cash drain and gets its hands on some much-needed cash.

To United's leaders, Mr. Hall is the hard-nosed politician who killed their plans to buy Frontier from People because it did not serve his constituency's interest.

And to many of the 4,700 bitter former employees of Frontier, which is now in bankruptcy, Mr. Hall is the man who promised he would save their jobs and then did not.

However, to hear Mr. Hall tell it, he has been set up as a scapegoat by United's Machiavellian leaders, who, he contends, never intended to buy Frontier in the first place. Given his aspirations to be elected the next leader of the Air Line Pilots Association in November, he acknowledged, his image problem could not have happened at a worse time. Effect on Candidacy
