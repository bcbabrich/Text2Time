South Korean consumer prices increased only slightly in February, indicating the country's fast economic recovery has not yet generated inflationary pressures, the Finance and Economy Ministry said. South Korea's consumer price index edged up 0.3 percent in February from January, the lowest monthly rise since 1988, the ministry said. In the first two months of this year, the index rose 0.4 percent, which is well below the average increase of 2 percent in the corresponding periods between 1990 and 1999. Samuel Len
