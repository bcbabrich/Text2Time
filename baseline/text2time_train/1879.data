I spent a lot of time over the past few weeks talking with people about the subject of authenticity at work, first for my print column about Stewart Friedman’s leadership philosophy and then in conversations for my Web column about Lisa Sherman’s experiences in coming out as a lesbian executive.

All this makes me want to know how comfortable people feel about revealing their whole selves at work, whether they work for themselves or for other organizations. Please read the column and if Lisa Sherman’s story resonates with you in any way, use the comments to share your own experiences. And if you’d like to chime in on what you would have done in her case (which will make sense to you after you read the column), please do that as well. If you’re going to leave a comment, please try to keep it to about 300 words.
