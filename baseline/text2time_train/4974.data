Because I am a traditionalist in regard to holidays, I don't prepare fancy or esoteric dishes, preferring to choose food I know everyone will find familiar: time-honored classics like salmon, chicken and potato salad. I like to give these standards a new twist, however, sometimes by adding an herb that lends an unexpected taste to an old favorite. I use coriander in my potato salad in this menu, for example, and mint to flavor the chicken. Or I might prepare an old standby in a different way; husked corn on the cob is cooked on the grill until the kernels begin to brown and the moisture that comes to the surface caramelizes.

Often it is the presentation of the food that does the trick. Serving pink salmon in a pool of bright green sauce lends excitement to the dish. Likewise with my berry dessert: on a white platter, the red and blue berries celebrate the colors of the flag. Drinks begin with tea-honey punch - a staple at our house in the summer when the days are sunny and mint is plentiful. We brew the tea in the sun along with branches of mint in a big jar reserved just for this purpose. And partygoers can add a little rum to their tall glasses if they're so inclined.

For the first course, I serve salmon, a traditional Fourth of July dish in the Northeast. Baked with a green herb sauce, it's especially good when the salmon is freshly cooked and served while still lukewarm or at room temperature. Once salmon has been refrigerated, it tightens and the taste is adversely affected. If done ahead, warm just enough to take the chill off in a conventional oven or a microwave. The ingredients for the sauce should be based on what is available at the market but I like a combination of watercress, chives, dill, parsley, basil and tarragon. Keep in mind that certain herbs - like tarragon and dill - are stronger than, say, parsley or chives and should be added in moderation.

The mushroom and potato salad with coriander is best served at room temperature, which means it can be prepared in the morning and set aside. If it is prepared ahead and refrigerated, warm it briefly in a microwave to bring it to room temperature.

I use chicken legs for my grilled chicken with mint and vinegar dip; they're moister than the breasts when grilled, especially if prepared ahead and dabbed with the sauce just before serving. The dip can be made ahead and will keep for a couple of weeks in the refrigerator. It also can be used with poached fish or to season salads.
