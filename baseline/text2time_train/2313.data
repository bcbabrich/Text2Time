Here’s the last of our mini-profiles of third-party candidates for New York State comptroller. [Earlier: Willie Cotton, Socialist Workers Party; John J. Cain, Libertarian Party.]

Julia Willebrand is the Green Party candidate.

Ms. Willebrand has been involved with the Greens for about a dozen years. As she tells it, she grew up poor, one of 10 kids in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. She’s been a waitress, college professor and a mother. She ran for State Senate on the Upper West Side in 1998 and for mayor of New York in 2001. She did not win.

If elected, she says would use the post to end to handouts to corporations, crack down on Medicaid fraud and create government incentives to promote environmental projects, affordable housing and new jobs. She would also work to promote world peace and end the genocide in Darfur.

Bonus Video: You can watch her give a speech, take questions and say uncomplimentary things about Alan G. Hevesi long before it was fashionable.

As with the others, we invite Professor Willebrand or her supporters to post more about her background and positions in the comments below.
