"We tried our best to dignify the sport of soccer," Portugal Coach Carlos Queiroz said. "Too bad the goals did not come. If the field was dry, there would be less collisions and fewer lost passes." Preview of 1993 Match

The match, part of the round-robin United States Cup that also features the national teams of Ireland and the United States, was far from meaningless. Portugal and Italy will face each other next February in a pivotal World Cup qualifying match. There was some significant sizing up being done today.

Italy started a lineup that was nearly as famous as its blue jerseys. Forwards Roberto Baggio and Gianluca Vialli poached near Portugal's goal ineffectively while goaltender Walter Zenga killed time while facing only three shots.

"Goalkeeping is a strange position," Zenga said. "I do more than make saves. I collaborate with the defense."

Italy controlled the match for most of the first half, when it seemed as if the young, fleet Portuguese were star-gazing or playing for some nonexistent tie breaker. In the second half, after a slew of substitutions by both sides, Portugal became somewhat more aggressive with its counterattacks.
