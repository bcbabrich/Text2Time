The Yankees announced yesterday that Mickey Mantle would throw out the ceremonial first ball at the Yankee Stadium opener April 16.

Mantle made his last Stadium appearance on old-timer's day on Aug. 7, 1982.

Mantle and Willie Mays had been banned from baseball for their association in public-relation capacities with Atlantic City casinos. They were reinstated on March 18 by Commissioner Peter Ueberroth.
