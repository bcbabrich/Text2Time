Introduced on Wednesday: 2011 Hyundai Sonata Turbo (and Hybrid)

Is it real? Yes, but in the “believe-it-when-I-drive-it” category. We will wait until it arrives in showrooms in late 2010 to do anything but quote the Hyundai-supplied power claims.

What they said: “We’re not fans of compromising at Hyundai, and the Sonata really demonstrates this aspect of our business approach,” said Jon Krafcik, president and chief executive of Hyundai Motor America.

What they didn’t say: The Sonata will use 4-cylinder engines of somewhat questionable provenance to compete in classes dominated by those offering V-6s.

What makes it tick? A twin-scroll turbocharged 2-liter direct-injection 4-cylinder producing 274 horsepower and 269 foot-pounds of torque. Hyundai claims the Sonata Turbo will also get 34 miles per gallon fuel economy on the highway and run on 87 octane regular unleaded. Would you believe a hybrid version with a 2.4-liter, 169-horsepower 4-cylinder and a 40-horsepower electric motor (turned by lithium-something batteries), good for 37 city/39 highway? I’ll believe that when I see that, too.

How much? How soon? This fall, at a price still to be dreamed up.

How does it look? Busy. A mix between a Mercedes-Benz C-Class and a Lexus ES.
