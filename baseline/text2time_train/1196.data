THURSDAY’S PUZZLE — I did it! I figured out that a puzzle was a rebus all by my lonesome!

That’s almost as exciting as the first time I solved a Saturday puzzle on my own. You never forget your first time, do you?

Not only that, but I really liked this game-themed puzzle by Xan Vongsathorn. I must have played at least one bajillion and eleventy-two games of DUCK, DUCK, GOOSE with my kids — a game that definitely got a lot more fun once I’d had more than one kid — and they never, ever, not once tired of it, even when I begged them to please, guys, in the name of all that is holy, give me a break. So I spent a lot of their young childhood running in circles.

Anyway, you will pat five DUCKs on the head (10, if you count the crossings) before you reach the GOOSE at 68 Across. I liked SITTING DUCK and the mouthwatering PEKING DUCK, and who doesn’t love an appearance by DAISY DUCK?

Once I got the “rebus gist,” a new phrase that I am coining to celebrate my victory and define the point of the rebus in the puzzle, it was pretty fast going, and in fact I found myself racing to the bottom of the grid to catch my GOOSE. Were you aware of speeding up at all?

Some of the longer entries are very cool, too. I liked ICE SKATE, ON THE DOT, and PLEATHER, which is not only an inexpensive couch covering, as the clue suggests, but is also a vegetarian option for those who don’t wear leather.

Thanks for the game, Mr. Vongsathorn. Next time, let’s play Tag.

You’ll have to watch almost all of this clip to see Chuck Berry DUCKWALK, but it’s worth it. If your soul keeps singing the blues, then you will be DUCKWALKing too.
