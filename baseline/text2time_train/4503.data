In the gaggle of children jostling for position around Annie the cow, Bryant Powell was the first to squeeze a fine stream of milk onto the ground.

"Yo," said the 10-year-old from Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, who had never before seen a cow. "It's cool."

But when a camp counselor squirted milk into her open palm and licked it, Bryant was as skeptical as the others.

"Can you drink that?" he asked.

Bryant was one of two dozen children from some of New York's toughest neighborhoods who toured a model farm at Camp Hayden-Marks Memorial in Fishkill, N.Y. The children, most of whom had never seen farm animals before, were to spend the next two weeks at the camp. They had marched more than a mile through the wooded countryside to a small stable, where counselors tend a vegetable garden and care for animals borrowed for the camping season from local farmers.
