To the Editor: Betsy Wade's article "In Trip Insurance, Small Print Is No Small Matter" (Oct. 11) brought to light problems faced by the traveler as well as by the travel agent. Among the cases Ms. Wade cited was the problem faced by Mr. and Mrs. Richard Kammerer, long-time clients of my agency, Travel Headquarters of Short Hills, N.J. When Mr. Kammerer fell ill, he could not get compensation for the cost of the cruise the couple was not able to take on Pearl Cruises because the trip-cancellation coverage ceased when they began their trip.

The article did not report that Pearl Cruises' insurance policy arrived less than 10 days before the Kammerers' departure. This was past the deadline for purchase of a Chubb policy called Travelsafe that our agency always recommends to tour and cruise clients if the operator's policy is not broad enough. Travelsafe covers for trip cancellation, interruption and delay, and remains in force for the duration of the trip. ELIZABETH L. KOCH Short Hills, N.J.
