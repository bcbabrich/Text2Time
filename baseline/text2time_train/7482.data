MOSCOW, July 31 (AP)—A cave‐in on a Moscow subway line closed the route for two days, Izvestia reported tonight. The Soviet Government newspaper said that a wall of about 1,050 cubic yards of mud fell onto the line as a train was traveling from Oktabraskaya station to Leninsky Prospekt station Tuesday. The driver saw the cave‐in in time and backed his train. No one was hurt.
