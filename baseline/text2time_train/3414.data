Scott Shuger spends the small hours each morning reading newspapers on line and writing a daily column for Microsoft's on- line magazine, Slate, critiquing newspapers across the country. The column, Today's Papers, appears unedited.

Last week, Mr. Shuger was the target of some pretty fiery critiques himself.

The reason was his comments in last Monday's column about African-American college students. He was critiquing an article in The New York Times about a survey that showed a wide disparity in computer use between students entering elite private colleges and those attending traditionally black public institutions.

Mr. Shuger suggested that ''it might be good to add a question to the survey: 'Do you have a luxury sound system or a car less than two years old, or a luxury sound system in that car?' Today's Papers recalls being in Atlanta a few years ago at the annual spring break for traditionally black colleges, Freaknik, and being amazed at the numbers of students' hot cars and loud stereos. Any computer/Internet paucity among students attending traditionally black colleges may be a function of their own interests and choices rather than that of affordability.''

E-mail responses to the magazine were overwhelmingly negative, calling Mr. Shuger's remarks ''racist'' and ''idiotic.''
