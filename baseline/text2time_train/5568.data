DAYLIGHT lingers longer now in the evenings but rare is the city gardener who finds enough time for this month's activities in the garden. May is the planting month and every minute spent in the garden will reap rewards this summer.

Unless yours is an unusually sunny spot, don't expect this year's tulips, daffodils or hyacinths to re-bloom next year; in the city's shaded canyons these plants are unreliable as repeaters and are best dug up and discarded after flowering.

Replant empty spaces with summer bulbs, corms and rootstocks. For sunny rooftop planters use the dwarf forms of dahlias, cannas and gladioluses whose colorful, tall, flower stalks add contrasting vertical accents. Also notable is chinkerichee, a lily relative that bears long-lasting white blossoms on 18-inch stems, or the easily grown montbretia, an iris relative with wiry-stemmed scarlet or gold-toned flowers, or crinum, which has tall, funnel-shaped blooms and narrow leaves.

In yards with light shade, summer bulbs include agapanthus, with its tall, white or purple flower globes, the calla lilies that have cone-shaped blooms, or the fragrant, summer daffodil, hymenocallis. Most are available for planting now from city garden centers including the Farm and Garden Nursery, 2 Avenue of the Americas (White Street), 212-431-3577; mail and telephone orders will be accepted until June by John Sheepers Inc., 63 Wall Street, New York, N.Y. 10005, 212-422-1177.
