Upon arriving at their practice facility for media day, Sprewell told the Knicks that his right hand, which was visibly swollen, was bothering him. The Knicks immediately sent him for X-rays, which revealed a fracture of the fifth metacarpal near the knuckle of the pinkie.

''He kept it to himself,'' a Knicks spokesman said. ''He didn't tell anybody because he didn't think it was a big deal.''

Sprewell, who will be replaced by Shandon Anderson in the lineup, would not comment today, and the Knicks refused to make him available to the news media.

Though Sprewell could have easily seen when he first noticed pain or swelling, Knicks Coach Don Chaney said he was the type of player who could be injured and not realize it. Sprewell's agent, Bob Gist, said that he spoke with Sprewell on Thursday, and that he did not mention the injury.

''You've got to understand who we're dealing with,'' Chaney said. ''We're dealing with a very tough player, probably the toughest player on our team, so he's not going to complain about anything. We're always bumping and bruising ourselves, and when we have a little swelling here, a little soreness there, we don't really complain that much about it. And he is the epitome of a guy who doesn't complain about injuries. He bangs himself all the time, so I would imagine, with him hitting himself, he probably said, 'Well, it's just a bruise, no big deal.' ''

Though he has largely remade his image during his four seasons with the Knicks, Sprewell has been embroiled in more than his share of controversies with the club. Perpetually late for home games, Sprewell missed training camp in 1999 because of an unexcused absence. He was fined by the club last season for walking out of a mandatory team meeting at which the Madison Square Garden chairman, James L. Dolan, was present. And he skipped a pregame shootaround and arrived just 80 minutes before tip-off for a game in Miami late last season. Sprewell was initially fined $125,000 -- one game's pay -- for that transgression, but after he fought the penalty, Dolan rescinded all but $2,500 of the fine.

The Knicks, perhaps fed up with Sprewell's antics, tried to trade him this past summer, shopping him in an attempt to land point guard Andre Miller, now with the Los Angeles Clippers.
