But the new crop of tablet PC's represent much more than machines mimicking pen and paper. Computer makers say that technology is forcing handwriting to evolve in terms of how and when it is used. The tablet PC's may not only reflect those changes but also hasten them.

''I don't think we are physically losing our ability to write with a pen and pencil, but I do see changes,'' said Edie Adams, manager of hardware user research for Microsoft. For example, she said, handwriting has become more useful as a thinking aid, for taking brief notes and working out ideas. Tablet PC technology is designed to take advantage of this aspect of handwriting -- as ''one to one, or even one to self'' communication, Ms. Adams said.

But Microsoft has also had to focus on just how ''dirty'' quick and dirty handwriting can be. Mr. Dixon said that developing the tablet's handwriting recognition software was complicated by the necessity that it be able to recognize a wide range of handwriting styles at a time when many Americans say they can hardly recognize their own.

More than one million handwriting samples are written into the tablet's software to help it read and convert handwriting into text. Even so, Microsoft acknowledges that the technology converts handwriting into digital text with varying degrees of success. But developers say that people should expect no more from the technology than they would from the person doing the writing.

''If someone takes a handwritten note and the next day they come back and can't read it,'' Mr. Dixon said, ''well, our handwriting recognition engine is not going to do so well on it either. The general rule of thumb is that you get better results with neater handwriting.''

For years, computer technology developers have been searching for a reliable and simple means to let people write on their computers as easily as they might type on them. The concept got its first widespread exposure in the mid-1990's with Apple's Newton, a pioneering hand-held computer. But the Newton ultimately failed, as did several more recent attempts, including a pen-based I.B.M. ThinkPad and a Sony Vaio desktop Pen Tablet.

Microsoft's effort is by far the most ambitious to convince computer users that the pen can be as logical an addition to the keyboard as the mouse. Like previous proponents of handwriting-recognition software, the company hopes that some users will find it easier to write on a computer screen than use a keyboard.
