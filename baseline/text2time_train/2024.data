Turns out I didn’t have to bribe my wife and daughter to let me watch Saturday’s games. My daughter had a ‘dance out’ late Saturday afternoon, and by the time she and her mother came home, there were fewer than seven minutes left in the Ohio State-Georgetown game. Greg Oden’s free throw gave Ohio State a 7-point lead, my daughter did her homework and I pleaded for Jeff Green to please take a shot.

Green, the Big East player of the year, played a surprisingly poor game and that was more significant, to me, than the strong game Mike Conley Jr. played for Ohio State. Look at the play-by-play; Green’s first shot didn’t come until 3 minutes 16 seconds remained in the opening half. His first shot in the second half didn’t come until 6:10 remained in the game.

The Big East player of the year can’t play like that. Green needed to take control of the game, especially with Oden sitting as much as he played because of foul trouble.

I was able to watch Florida-U.C.L.A. too, because my daughter had to go to bed early to get plenty of sleep for her feis today in Connecticut. She’s a competitive Irish step dancer. Step dancing has its own world, its own subculture, its own social code, its own economy. My daughter is 10, and she wants to qualify as a solo dancer for the Oireachtas (regional championships) in November. Oireachtas is a Gaelic word and I am pretty certain it means: 3,000 girls (and boys) from age 6-20 running around in a convention center for three days, dancing in curly wigs and sequined dresses that cost $2,000 or so.

But back to Florida-U.C.L.A.

I was wrong about the Gators. I thought their slump in February – three losses, each by at least 10 points – was significant because it would expose them as a flawed and complacent group. Flawed? Not that I can see. Complacent? Perhaps in February. Perhaps they turned to one another after they lost by 10 at Tennessee and said, “Ready to play?”

Since that loss, the Gators have won nine straight by an average of nearly 17 points.

The matchup I’m eager to see tomorrow night is, as usual, between the point guards, Florida’s Taurean Green against Conley of Ohio State. I acknowledge Joakim Noah is the Gators’ leader emotionally. Al Horford gives them power inside, Corey Brewer gives them whatever they need whenever they need it and Lee Humphrey gives them an incredible shooting threat. But I think the Gators need Green to bring it all together.

When Florida pounded Ohio State in late December, Green was a scorer more than a point guard, shooting 9 for 12 and scoring 24 points. Conley had more of a point-guard game with 13 points, 7 assists and 5 rebounds.

I think Green, who was sloppy offensively against Darren Collison of U.C.L.A. on Saturday, will have to be more of a point guard tomorrow. Conley has become one of the best point guards in the country, and I think he’s the best point guard still playing. He’ll have to be.

He will have to contain Green and keep him from penetrating and passing to Brewer and Humphrey for 3-pointers. U.C.L.A. tried double-teaming Green when he came off that high screen set by Noah. But Green’s quickness (and some quick whistles) put a stop to that. Brewer had a perfect first half, making all four of his free throws and all four of his field-goal attempts, including 3 3-pointers, to score 15 points. Oh, he kept Arron Afflalo scoreless in the half, too.

Humphrey is making 45 percent of his 3-pointers and averaging a little more than 12 points a game in the tournament, and his shooting has sparked Florida early in the second half in the past three games. I think he’s more of a consistent threat than Ohio State’s Jamar Butler, who is averaging 11 points a game in the tournament, or Daquan Cook. True, Humphrey disappears at times, (see the Purdue game) but he makes 3-pointers when it’s time.

The other matchup I’m looking forward to is Brewer against Ron Lewis, the Buckeyes’ main shooter. Lewis has scored throughout the tournament (19.2 points a game), despite scoring only 9 points Saturday against Georgetown. He made big shots against Xavier and Tennessee. He can force opponents to stretch their defense, which creates space for Conley to drive and gives Oden more room underneath. After what Brewer did to Afflalo, I’m eager to see how he plays against Lewis. A look at the box score will show Afflalo shooting 5 for 14 and scoring 17 points. But that all came in the final six minutes and a few seconds, when Florida’s lead never dipped below 10 points.

That leaves the matchup of the big men, Horford and Noah against Oden. Horford returned from a sprained left ankle to play in their first matchup in December and came away with 11 points and 11 rebounds. Noah had 7 points, 8 rebounds and 4 blocks. But honestly, in such a lopsided game, most individual numbers are skewed. The game was Oden’s fifth; he missed the Buckeyes’ first seven while he recovered from surgery on his right wrist.

The Buckeyes escaped against Georgetown on Saturday despite Oden’s foul troubles, which have followed him throughout the tournament. He had one foul in the first 51 seconds against Georgetown, a second foul 1:50 after that, and a seat on the bench. In all, Oden sat for 20 minutes and played for 20 minutes. In the 20 minutes he played: 13 points, 6-for-11 shooting, 9 rebounds, 1 blocked shot.

Yes, the Buckeyes are accustomed to playing without Oden. But Matt Terwilliger and Othello Hunter will be overhelmed by Horford (6-foot-10, 245 pounds), Noah (6-11, 232) and Chris Richard (6-9, 255).

I intend to have a couple of pregame slices of pizza (pepperoni) and a soda, send my daughter to bed, and watch the game to see how accurate I am.

Just got the call. She won first place in slip jig. Another step closer to the Oireachtas.
