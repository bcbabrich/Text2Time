Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx Borough president and mayoral candidate, dropped in to an East Side sports bar on Thursday night to kick off a Democratic debate-watching party organized by the Committee of Latinos for Hillary. The bar, Tonic East on Third Avenue in Murray Hill, was pumped with dance music and the raised voices of young professionals straining to chat. A mosaic of big-screen televisions flashed hockey and basketball games. But the high energy wasn’t for Hillary. Amid the regular Thursday night revelry, in a corner of a second-floor balcony, a small crowd of suit-clad Clinton supporters waited for the candidates to speak.

Mr. Ferrer, a seasoned politician who has been a government relations consultant since his unsuccessful challenge to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in 2005, welcomed the 25 or so attendees with a joking apology. “It’s been a long time since I’ve addressed supporters from the back of a bar. I’m a little out of practice,” he said into a microphone over the din.

Support for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is strong among New York City’s Latino voters. Nearly all of the most prominent state and city Latino politicians have lined up between Mrs. Clinton, who has also received intense coverage in the Spanish-language press.

Other debate-watching events in the city had bigger crowds, but this one ended up feeling more like an informal get-together for some key campaigners in Latinos for Hillary than a rousing rally. While there were some Hillary buttons, for example, there wasn’t a Hillary sign in sight.

With the noise level in the bar so loud that hearing the debate took full attention, there was also little outward reaction to what was shown on the screen. Obama attracted some nods with his explanation of comprehensive immigration reform, especially his insistence on creating a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. But, said Julissa Reynoso, a lawyer on the Latinos for Hillary steering committee, Hillary’s detailed answer “simply had more meat on it.”

“Latinos really connect with Hillary because they feel she has a real sense of compassion for what we are going through,” she said.

One thing the Clinton supporters wanted to dispel was the idea that Latinos wouldn’t vote for Mr. Obama because of historic tension between blacks and Latinos. “This is not about being against Obama,” Mr. Ferrer said. “This is about being for Hillary. I am absolutely living proof that blacks and Latinos can come together in an election coalition. It’s what happened for me in 2001 and 2005.” The strong support he received from both groups was not enough, though, in his two unsuccessful campaigns for mayor (in the abbreviated and subdued campaign after the Sept. 11 attacks, he lost the postponed 2001 Democratic primary to Mark Green, who was then defeated by Mr. Bloomberg.)

“Hillary’s relationship with the Latino community has always been strong,” Mr. Ferrer added. “It’s a long relationship based on real achievements, not something that happened two weeks ago. She’s stood with us on health care, on access to capital. She’s been with us absolutely every step of the way since the White House.”

While pro-Clinton feeling dominated, many of her supporters also echoed the on-stage camaraderie shown by the two candidates. Marcos Vigil, a 32-year-old lawyer who organized the event, said that while he thought Mrs. Clinton would make the better president, he would still be satisfied if Mr. Obama were the nominee.

As the debate wound into its second hour, Mr. Vigil said he was impressed by how alike many of the two candidates’ policy proposals were. “Hillary’s seen it all. She knows what to expect, and she understands how the bureaucracy works. But whichever candidate Democrats put forward, we will rally around,” he said.
