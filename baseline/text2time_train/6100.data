Miriam Bockman was unanimously elected the first woman leader of the Manhattan Democratic organization yesterday in a move that signaled the transfer of political power from Mayor Beanie to Representation Edward I. Koch, the Democratic candidate for Mayor.

The 45‐year‐old Mrs. Bockman, who is the Democratic co‐leader in Greenwich Village, was also the first member of the liberal, often anti‐organization New Democratic Coalition to be elected a county chairman.

Mr. Koch said earlier that he was not taking a position on the county leadership, and he reiterated that statement when he made a surprise appearance last night at the meeting of the Manhattan Democratic executive committee after Mrs. Bockman had been elected.

Mr. Koch and Mrs. Bockman have long been close friends and she works in the Koch mayoral campaign. They are both members of the Village Independent Democrats, and Mrs. Bockman's co‐leader, John LoCicero, is one of Mr. Koch's top advisers.
