To the Editor:

Now that members of the New York State Senate and Assembly have decided to vote themselves a 30 percent salary increase (news story, July 12), I would hope that the State Legislature will become full time.

At present, members of the State Legislature meet only from January to July. Now that our Senators and Assemblymen will be earning salaries that exceed the full-time salaries of most New Yorkers, voters have a right to expect our lawmakers to meet during the last half of the year as well as the first.

A State Legislature that would meet regularly during the year would serve the public interest. Much of the work in Albany takes place during the last week of the session - as lawmakers are rushing to go home. Hundreds of bills are approved in the final hours of the session, and many legislators have not even had time to scrutinize the bills they are voting on.

Voting on bills in the middle of the night is not fair to the voters, who have a right to expect their elected officials to vote on bills under proper conditions. Members of a full-time State Legislature would have more time to review the bills they approve or reject. PAUL FEINER Westchester County Legislator Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., July 12, 1987
