Tea, Russian-Style, For an Arts Group

''When he started talking about opening the Russian Tea Room, I said, 'I get opening night,' '' LINDA JANKLOW recalled.

The man she was talking about was her brother, the flamboyant restaurateur WARNER LEROY, who will open the remodeled and redecorated Russian Tea Room on West 57th Street (slightly to the left of Carnegie Hall, as the radio commercials used to say) with a gala on Monday for ArtsConnection, a nonprofit group.

That was exactly what Ms. Janklow wanted. She is the chairwoman of ArtsConnection, which arranges programs and after-school workshops to bring students and teachers together with artists and musicians.

Having agreed to the ArtsConnection event on Monday, Mr. LeRoy had to take down a sign that said the restaurant would open Oct. 11. That is when it will open to the public, but, Mr. LeRoy said, the sign posed a problem: ''The workmen said, 'Oh, we got another week.' ''
