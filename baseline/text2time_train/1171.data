“If it happened here, can it happen again, and if so, where?” a newscaster asks at the start of “Piranha 3DD,” as the camera pans the abandoned Lake Victoria where the 2010 film “Piranha 3D” took place. In place of the “it” in her inquiry, read “the making of a dumb horror parody about killer fish that like to bite private parts.” The answer, of course, is yes, it can.

As for the “where,” the action in this inept sequel moves to a water park called “The Big Wet,” where the sleazy Chet (David Koechner), over the objections of his co-owner and stepdaughter, Maddy (Danielle Panabaker), has added an “adult pool” section, and prehistoric piranha apparently don’t care for it. They have found their way to the park via underground waterways, and soon they’re chowing down.

A few stars from the earlier film, like Christopher Lloyd (the closest thing to funny this movie has) and Ving Rhames, reprise their roles. Others stayed away but have been replaced by the likes of Gary Busey and David Hasselhoff (who plays himself).

The director, John Gulager, has no idea how to mix his ingredients to create a savvy self-parody. Instead he flings comic bits and gross-out gags around desperately. The signature joke of this series seems to be castration. Just as in the earlier film, a male organ becomes fish food. Why aim high when you can aim low?
