Modest construction work is expected to resume on Wednesday morning at Broadway’s Hilton Theater to prepare for the new musical production “Spider-Man, Turn Off the Dark,” even though the ultimate fate of the show is still in limbo, three people involved with the production said this afternoon.

Work on “Spider-Man” was suspended in early August because of cash flow problems on the part of the lead producer, Hello Entertainment; some of the show’s prospective cast members, meanwhile, were informed that the musical might be canceled altogether, according to agents for those actors.

The three people involved with the production said that there was only enough new money to have a handful of workers return to the Hilton on Wednesday; actors have yet to be reassured that the musical is on, and full-scale work on the multimillion-dollar scenery is still on hold.

These people said that the difficulty of raising money to fully capitalize the show, which is expected to cost $35 million or more, has yet to be resolved.

They added that the musical’s problems would not be solved by the announcement Monday that the Walt Disney Company would acquire Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion; the Spider-Man character is a Marvel property, but neither Marvel nor Disney is expected to put significant money, if any, into the show.

A publicist for “Spider-Man” said previews for the musical, directed by Julie Taymor (“The Lion King”), were still expected to begin in February.
