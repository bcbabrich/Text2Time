A woman whose husband died in the crash of an Air National Guard fighter plane almost two years ago filed a $4.1 million damage suit in Federal District Court in Manhattan, contending that the aircraft was defectively designed and improperly maintained by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.

The plaintiff was Marilyn Szatanek of Liverpool, N.Y., whose husband, Edward, 38 years old, was navigator of the F-101B fighter plane that crashed near Niagara Falls International Airport on June 9, 1979.

Mrs. Szatanek filed the suit in Federal District Court on behalf of herself and two children, Jeffrey, 14, and Stacy, 12.
