Two advertisers have made decisions on their accounts.

Moviefone Inc. named Mad Dogs and Englishmen in New York to handle its account in a review that began in March, when Ryan Drossman & Partners in New York, Moviefone's first agency, said it was leaving the account after almost eight years.

The review, managed by Sound Thinking, a New York consulting company, had been narrowed to Mad Dogs and two other New York-based finalists: the Grey Entertainment unit of Grey Advertising and Margeotes/Fertitta & Partners. Moviefone's annual budget is estimated at more than $25 million in a combination of paid spending and barter, ads run in exchange for radio time or newspaper space.

Andrew Jarecki, chief executive of Moviefone in New York, said Mad Dogs would develop strategy and consumer and trade campaigns for the telephone service as well as the sibling on-line service, Movielink.com (www.movielink.com).

And Lone Star Steakhouse and Saloon Inc. named Levenson & Hill in Dallas as the first agency to handle its advertising. Though billings were not disclosed, Adweek estimated them at $15 million to $20 million.
