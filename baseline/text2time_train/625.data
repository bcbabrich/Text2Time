In the world’s crowded earthquake zones, from the Himalayas to the Pacific Northwest, every community faces enormous challenges in designing for inevitable, but unpredictable jolts.

This challenge is particularly acute in poor or poorly governed places. And Nepal is both, as Ilan Kelman, an expert on risk and resilience at University College London, made vividly clear in “How earthquake safety measures could have saved thousands of lives in Nepal,” a piece on The Conversation website.

But there’s much that can be done with education and sustained effort to overcome corrosive forces like corruption in construction practices and oversight, and ignorance.

Remarkably, experts tell me they see signs of progress amid the destruction and carnage in Nepal left by the 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck 50 miles from Katmandu last Saturday.

[Read Chris Buckley’s revealing article on the mix of rapid urbanization and graft that contributed to many building collapses. Track the latest official updates here and here. The latest tally is 160,786 houses destroyed and 143,673 damaged.]

Progress would be a good thing, because this earthquake is not nearly Katmandu’s “big one.” A closer quake of similar magnitude is inevitable, although seismologists cannot say how soon.

The evidence of change is subtle, but significant, said Kit Miyamoto, one of many earthquake engineers scouring the wreckage and — as important — the buildings that did not fall.

Miyamoto is a structural engineer from California (and a member of that state’s Seismic Safety Commission), who has been in Katmandu since Tuesday and is helping “red tag” dangerous structures around the city — including a high-rise housing complex that was badly damaged but did not collapse, avoiding mass mortality. Preventing deaths is the prime goal in earthquake engineering.

By Skype, Miyamoto told me how, even at a “crude building site,” he saw a structural engineer’s holy grail – “ductile details” – shorthand for ways to secure parts of the steel-bar skeleton within concrete columns.

One critical step involves short pieces of steel rod that are bent and secured around long vertical elements — holding them together like the metal bands wrapping a wooden barrel support the staves. Generations of experience shows that the ends of these encircling bars need to be bent back at least 135 degrees to stay locked together under stress.

“Ductile details are a sacred thing,” Miyamoto said. “It’s the last line of defense.”

These are precisely the construction details that were absent in the wreckage of many of the schools that collapsed on students and teachers in China’s Sichuan Province in 2008.

Miyamoto said Nepal’s two-decade effort to improve building codes is important, but that adoption of new norms and habits by contractors there and in many other developing countries is likely more a function of spreading understanding of why such simple steps make a difference.*

“They have to know why that bend matters,” he said. “A few extra seconds of effort can keep a building from falling on their kids.”

He and others have credited the sustained work of Nepal’s National Society for Earthquake Technology and nonprofit groups such as GeoHazards International in helping spread such insights.

But they are racing the clock in many ways. The same is true around the world.

The population and building booms in seismic danger zones, particularly in poor countries, have put millions of people at risk. In a 2013 paper in Science, Brian Tucker, the founder of GeoHazards International, illustrated the problem by noting that the mortality rate of Haitians in areas severely shaken by the 2010 Port-au-Prince earthquake was 100 times higher than the rate in areas experiencing similar shaking in Chile’s great earthquake the same year.

In an excellent Vox piece on earthquake vulnerability, Brad Plumer explained the different outcomes found by Tucker:

In 1960, a 9.5-magnitude earthquake struck Chile, after which the country embarked on a massive earthquake-safety program and enforcing new building codes. By contrast, Haiti did nothing during this period, lulled into complacency by a lack of seismic activity and hampered by constant political unrest and extreme poverty.

(Complacency is not restricted to poor places with infrequent but potent earthquakes. Revisit my posts on Oregon’s slow recognition of the risk posed by the Cascadia fault to get the idea.)

In a world webbed by social media, there is an enormous emerging opportunity to use peer-to-peer communication to amplify education efforts. (The same networks — via Twitter and Facebook hashtags like #Sindhupalchowk, #Nuwakot and #Rasuwa — helped direct emergency helicopter flights to remote villages last week.)

[This is particularly important in countries like Nepal where, as Pete Spotts reported in the Christian Science Monitor, “only about 10 percent of the country’s buildings are designed by engineers – and they typically aren’t even at the construction site as their building rises.”]

It’s encouraging to see that the United Nations Development Program office in Nepal has created what amounts to an online course in simple, resilient building methods for both urban and rural structures on YouTube. I’ve compiled them in a single playlist at this shortened weblink: j.mp/buildsafernepal.

[Hands-on training is important, as well. In 2012, the municipal government in Katmandu, with the U.N.D.P., ran a workshop for women in masonry methods that can resist earthquake damage.]

The challenge is tougher in the hinterlands, of course. One reason thousands of rural communities peppering the slopes and valleys outside the Katmandu metropolis were particularly hard hit is that they lack access even to wood for construction timbers in the deforested highlands — let alone reinforced concrete.

(The vulnerable construction methods in rural communities around Asia prompted the seismologists Roger Bilham and Vinod Gaur to title a 2013 Science paper “Buildings as Weapons of Mass Destruction.”)

There are ways to build such housing more securely, but many Himalayan communities are only reachable using miles-long footpaths, so even bringing in wood from afar is a costly enterprise. There, experts are focusing on reinforcing critical structures like schools, which can serve as a haven for communities – if they don’t fall down like those in China did.

But concrete has to be mixed right — and then there are those ductile details. In such places, simpler communication methods can work.

A few years back, I wrote about an explanatory poster distributed by the thousands in Pakistan after the terrible 2005 earthquake that killed some 80,000 people. It was designed by Roger Bilham, at the University of Colorado, and Rebecca Bendick, a geologist at the University of Montana, with artwork by Bendick’s grandmother, Jeanne Bendick. (You can download the poster here.)

Bendick told me that similar posters, translated into Creole, have been distributed in Haiti through Teachers Without Borders.

Such efforts demonstrate that the most important ingredient in making the world’s seismic danger zones safer may not be ductile details or smart phones – but simply the motivation to devote some of one’s time to making sure good ideas get to where they matter.

Addendum | Images of Katmandu’s cracked high-rise buildings — which did not topple but, if built more sturdily, might have been salvageable — appear to be getting the attention of builders and regulators in India. According to the Economic Times, there’s a fresh discussion of the need for more stringent building codes for tall buildings, which currently are built to the same minimal standard as other structures.

Postscript, May 4 |

Solmaz Mohadjer, a University of Tübingen researcher developing the OpenFaultAsia online guide to earthquake faults in Asia, sent a comment on the importance of earthquake safety education. She’s been focused on classroom programs in Persian-speaking regions if Asia:

One such effort is the ParsQuake initiative, which was launched by Teachers Without Borders in 2011. The initiative focuses on training teachers living in earthquake-prone countries of Central Asia as earthquake safety messengers in their schools and the greater community. As part of this initiative, my colleagues and I created a teacher’s guide to earthquake education that combines science with hazards information, mitigation, and planning strategies to give school communities a comprehensive view of earthquakes and their impact on societies. The guide is translated into many languages and can be accessed for free here. We’ve also created a range of different educational material (videos, posters, etc.) for communicating earthquake information — all included in the ParsQuake link. As part of this initiative, we also aim to close the information gap between scientists and the public. This was highlighted in a recent Q&A interview session hosted by PreventionWeb.

Here’s a video about the program:
