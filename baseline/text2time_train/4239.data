Re "Cabby Made Taste of Democracy Costly" (letter, Nov. 28):

On one of my first trips to New York City we were meeting friends at the Odeon restaurant. We had taken the bus to where it seemed the restaurant would be close. The numbers on Broadway had got small. Not being from New York, I imagined it would turn into West Broadway.

We walked south. It was dark, late at night and late in the year. We had no map and were nervous to ask strangers where an address was. When we got to Battery Park, we realized something had gone wrong. As we walked back up, my wife's purse grew in psychological dimensions, as did her fears. We could not find a cab. The purse had grown to the size of a billboard. Every potential mugger was after us.

From nowhere a cab appeared. I told the driver to take us to our hotel, as my wife was so shaken at not being able to find the Odeon restaurant. "The Odeon," he said. "It's less than two blocks from here." As we got out of the cab, I realized he hadn't put the meter flag down. "No charge," he said as he drove off into the night.
