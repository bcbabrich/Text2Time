A letter to union members warns that constitutional provisions protecting their ''homes, families and jobs'' are in ''extreme danger.'' A labor official walking door-to-door tells people that their union pensions could be jeopardized. A television commercial darkly predicts that taxes will go up.

Tuning the political machinery that has made organized labor a perennial force in New York State elections, the state's largest unions have pulled out the stops in urging union workers to vote against a measure on next week's ballot to authorize a convention that would consider changes to the state's Constitution.

The unions, including the state A.F.L.-C.I.O., are spending millions of dollars on fliers and advertisements and mobilizing thousands of election workers to tell voters that a constitutional convention would be either an expensive waste of time or would allow big business to undermine decades-old union protections based on the State Constitution.

Labor strategists say they hope the state's more than 2.5 million union workers can tip the scales against the convention if voter turnout is light on Tuesday -- which is likely, since besides the convention question, only local offices are up for election in most districts.
