Giants defensive end Osi Umenyiora avoided a second straight off-season of contract controversy by agreeing to a restructured deal Friday, the team announced.

Umenyiora, whose 69 career regular-season sacks places him fourth on the Giants’ all-time list, was unhappy with his contract last off-season and did not report to training camp on time. He had skipped all previous team workouts this off-season as he sought a new deal again, and Umenyiora said in the team’s release that he was excited to put the negotiations behind him and will be present for Monday’s training session.

“This gives me peace of mind, definitely,” Umenyiora said. “We just resolved a situation. It really was affecting me in a bad way. Because I didn’t like all the negativity that was surrounding the whole situation. I couldn’t stand it, because if you know me, you know I’m not that type of person. I’m just happy all that is over with and I’ll be there. I’ll play out this contract, I’ll play this year and I’ll play my heart out.”

Umenyiora joins Mathias Kiwanuka as prominent defensive players to sign new contracts with the Giants this off-season. Terms of Umenyiora’s agreement were not disclosed.
