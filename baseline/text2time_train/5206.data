The official hiring of John Cooper as head football coach at Ohio State yesterday ended six weeks of uncertainty for the Buckeye players. Cooper was introduced to them by officials of the school as the replacement for Earle Bruce only a day after he coached Arizona State to a 33-28 victory over Air Force in the Freedom Bowl.

Bruce was dismissed Nov. 16 by Edward Jennings, the president of Ohio State, with a year left on his contract. He sued the school for $7.4 million for breach of contract and agreed to a $471,000 settlement.

''We were all just a little bit surprised over the way Coach Bruce was fired,'' said Derek Isaman, a starting defensive player. ''Now we can get this all over with and play ball.''

''I don't think there will be any animosity toward a new coach,'' said Joe Staysniak, a starting offensive tackle, who added that he had fond memories of Bruce and bitter memories of the way he was dismissed.
