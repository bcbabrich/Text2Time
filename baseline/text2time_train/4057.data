Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Connecticut has agreed to merge with Anthem Inc., a big Midwestern insurance company that is rapidly expanding across the country, people with knowledge of the deal said yesterday. The Connecticut insurer would become part of Anthem East Inc., based in Newark, along with Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in New Jersey and Delaware.

Anthem, based in Indianapolis, includes mutual insurance companies and managed health care units with Blue Cross and Blue Shield franchises in Indiana and Ohio; a publicly held insurance brokerage, Acordia Inc., and discount health networks in California, Florida and other states. With Connecticut, Anthem would have $10 billion in annual revenues.

A spokesman for Anthem said the company would not comment on reports of mergers. Connecticut Blue Cross and Blue Shield did not return telephone calls seeking comment late yesterday afternoon.

The merger, which would require approval of state regulators, is not expected to involve cash payments. Both companies are mutual insurers owned by their policyholders.
