A New York State advisory panel proposed major new programs yesterday to deal with the rising epidemic of AIDS among prison inmates, and health and prison officials endorsed the proposals as a strong plan for action.

Prisons could become a ''charnel house'' of inmates ''consigned to a tragic and hastened death'' unless such steps are taken, the panel warned.

Among the recommendations in its report are the creation of two AIDS wards to be run by private hospitals, expansion of nursing-home care for inmates, humane early release from prison for dying inmates, encouragement of testing with privacy protections, early medical intervention for those infected but not yet sick, access to experimental drugs, treatment for drug addiction, and support groups and counseling for prison staff members, inmates and their families.

One state official, who requested anonymity, estimated that the expanded health services could cost $70 million a year.
