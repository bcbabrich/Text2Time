The Federal Highway Administration is banning, as of Thursday, all further installation of two common kinds of guardrail along Government-financed highways after determining that the guardrails cause full-size pickup trucks to roll over in tests.

Pickup trucks are designed to climb up and over obstacles, a feature that is useful on muddy farms and construction sites but can be dangerous when they hit guardrails. Most sport utility vehicles are based on pickup designs and some ride even higher off the ground, leading many researchers to suspect that sport utility vehicles may also fare poorly when they strike guardrails. But few tests have been done with such vehicles, which have only recently become popular, so nobody knows whether they pose a problem.

State and Federal officials said there were no plans to replace hundreds of thousands of miles of guardrails because of the cost.

About 15,000 Americans are killed each year when their vehicles leave the road. About 1,100 of these deaths occur in crashes that begin when vehicles hit guardrails. Many other deaths occur in crashes that begin on the road and then send one or more vehicles into the guardrails, but the Government lacks accurate statistics on these crashes.
