The Thread is an in-depth look at how major news and controversies are being debated across the online spectrum.

For President Obama, losing the war would be bad. Losing the nation would be worse. But what are we to make of his losing Andrew Sullivan? Here is the commander in chief’s cheerleader in chief on last night’s Afghanistan speech:

I confess I do not feel those highest hopes. I do not share his confidence in American military and civilian power to turn the roiling region of Afghanistan and Pakistan into something less threatening. I see no reason after the last eight years to see how this can happen, even with these new resources. But if you rule out withdrawal right away, then this seems to me to be about the smartest strategy ahead. But I see absolutely no reason to believe that it will mean withdrawal of any significant amount in Obama’s first term.

Confused? If not, you will be after this: Via the Politico’s Arena, supportive words from a man who’s been somewhat critical of the president in the past, Rep. Joe Wilson.

I’m very pleased that he’s following the wishes of his commanders on the ground. They are requesting reinforcements and the best exit strategy is to win. By having the Afghan surge in the tradition of the Iraq surge that conditions us to win. Are enough troops being sent? It should be what the commanders in the field request. I also have a very personal feeling about the National Guard units there and the work they are doing. My National Guard unit served there in ’07-’08. I found out from them, visiting every three months that they were making a real difference. It’s a challenge because of the high illiteracy rate. But even with that they were making real progress, but needed more troops. Now they are going to be provided. As a veteran myself and father of four sons serving in the military, I have a deep appreciation of the personnel involved here.

Michael Rubin, writing at Forbes, thinks that Obama is no Bush, and that’s not a good thing:

Iraq’s surge succeeded because Bush convinced Iraqis that he would not subvert his commitment to victory to politics. Bush’s actions showed insurgents had misjudged the U.S. and that Bin Laden was wrong: The U.S. was no paper tiger. Iraqis, no more attracted to al-Qaida’s extreme vision than ordinary Afghans are to the Taliban, believed America to be strong. Rather than make accommodations to the terrorists, Iraqis could fight them. The Sunni tribesmen believed that the U.S. would guard their back, and let neither al-Qaida nor Iranian proxies run roughshod over them. For Iraqis and Afghans, it is an easy decision to ally with militarily superior forces led by a commander-in-chief with a clear and demonstrable will to victory. Obama is not Bush. By declaring his commitment finite, he removes the psychological force from his surge. NATO allies, who, because of limits they place on their troops’ activities, are hardly dependable on the best days, will understand that absent U.S. commitment, furthering their own commitments is silly. Pakistan will bolster its support for the Taliban. In Islamabad’s calculation, militant Islam is a lesser evil than Pashtun nationalism. If Obama is preparing to cut-and-run–which, fairly or unfairly, is how Pakistani generals will read his speech–then strengthening links to the Taliban will make Pakistan the dominant player in post-surge, post-withdrawal Afghanistan. The Taliban, too, will understand that, at best, they need only lay low, perhaps bloodying U.S. troops enough to keep the Afghanistan war unpopular among the Hollywood, university and media sets Obama cares about.

Lynn Sweet, writing at Politics Daily, feels the ghost of the previous president (and his No. 2) hung over the event:

Without mentioning President Bush’s name, Obama said Afghanistan commanders did not have the support they needed to fight the Taliban. Obama sent more troops after becoming president. Obama said, “I set a goal that was narrowly defined as disrupting, dismantling, and defeating al Qaeda and its extremist allies, and pledged to better coordinate our military and civilian effort.”

Did Obama “dither,” as former Vice President Dick Cheney said he did in deciding on sending in more troops? Without mentioning Cheney, Obama said, “Let me be clear: there has never been an option before me that called for troop deployments before 2010, so there has been no delay or denial of resources necessary for the conduct of the war.”

Michael Signer of DemocracyArsenal feels that critics on the left should listen the president before calling him a warmonger:

I’m struck so far in this speech by how resolutely pragmatic it is. For the president to spend so much time and analysis on cost reveals his situation and the deepest source of his reasoning. His citation of Eisenhower’s recognition that you have to balance competing priorities as president — not choose one ideology’s inducements over all others — shows how committed he is to deliberation and to fact-based policy. Those who are saying that Obama reminds them of Bush would do well to keep this in mind. Yes, he may have started with 9/11 — but this speech, in every respect, is a parade of logic and deliberation and facts, caged in by harsh fiscal reality. No crusader here.

No thanks, says David Dayen at FireDogLake, warmonger it is: “Jon Stewart’s going to have a field day matching up the surge speech from Bush on Iraq with this surge speech. They are interchangeable.”

Ace of Spades shows that sarcasm is bipartisan: “Obama to Troops: I Promise You I Will Furnish You With Every Resource You Need, So Long As What You Need Is Reasonably-Priced and Available as a Factory-Irregular from Marshall’s.”

“This part is cute too, coming as it does from the master of the trillion-dollar deficit,” writes Allahpundit at Hot Air of the president’s warnings about the cost of the war.

We can afford to ignore the price of everything else, but not the $30 billion or so a year — less than one-fifth of the deficit incurred just in the month of October — that it’ll cost to staff Afghanistan with new troops. Exit quotation from Niall Ferguson, writing this week in Newsweek: “This is how empires decline. It begins with a debt explosion. It ends with an inexorable reduction in the resources available for the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Which is why voters are right to worry about America’s debt crisis.”

I suppose Professor Ferguson knows of what he speaks, but I think for one night we forgot about the economy, and focused on the 30,000 more Americans heading off to take the fight to the enemy.
