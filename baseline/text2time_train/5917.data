Although the United States economy still ranks as the most productive in the world, Japan and other competitors are mounting a strong challenge in a number of fields, including high technology, automobiles and textiles.

In the view of many members of both Government and industry, one factor holding back the United States is its stiff antitrust laws. ''There's no question we are becoming less competitive because of our antitrust laws,'' maintains D. Bruce Merrifield, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Productivity, Technology and Innovation.

In their view, it is time to make changes in the nation's antitrust laws so that American corporations, like their overseas rivals, can work together without being hampered by rules prohibiting such collaboration. Congress is already considering legislation that would ease such industry cooperation.

Opponents doubt the efficacy of such legislation, however, and suggest that liberalization of antitrust laws to facilitate research might lead to abuses in other areas.
