In the interim, the officers will remain on modified duty, in which they are paid but are assigned to desk jobs, without the right to carry a badge or a gun. The other officers, aside from Mr. McMellon, are expected to return to work in a few days or weeks, their lawyers said.

Unlike criminal trials, in which the evidence must show the defendants are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, in police administrative proceedings the department must show that defendants violated a policy based only on a preponderance of the evidence.

''We are confident that that review will find the officers blameless in the same manner that the criminal trial did,'' Mr. Worth said. ''The facts remain the same.''

Officials said the same unit of Internal Affairs investigators, known as Group 54, that handled the criminal investigation was likely to handle the upcoming administrative review. The unit will try to determine whether the officers properly followed guidelines and training bulletins that outline the tactics they should use during street encounters and that govern the situations in which it is permissible to fire their guns.

The unit's findings will then be presented to a firearms discharge review board, a five-member panel led by Chief of Department Joseph Dunne, officials said. If the officers are found to have followed procedures, the current charges against them would likely be dropped, officials said.

If the review board were to find that the officers engaged in misconduct, their cases would be forwarded to the department's in-house prosecutor for a disciplinary trial, in which the verdict would be rendered by an administrative law judge. The judge's decision in such a case would then be forwarded to Police Commissioner Howard Safir, who would make the final decision as to any disciplinary action, officials said.

Although Mr. Safir has spoken in recent days of his compassion for what he described as the trauma the officers have suffered through, he has withheld comment on whether they deserve to remain on the force, citing the pending investigation.
