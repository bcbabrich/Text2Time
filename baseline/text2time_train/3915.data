GARY HIRSHBERG, the president of Stonyfield Farm, knows two ways to increase his profits. By expanding his yogurt-manufacturing capacity, he can pay back his investment in a year and keep growing. Or by installing readily available technology for energy conservation at his New Hampshire plant, he can recoup his costs in two years or less and bank the future savings till the cows come home.

Mr. Hirshberg has chosen to do both. Stonyfield, he says, will increase production 40 percent next year. By taking steps like installing efficient lights and reusing waste heat, he is now using 9 percent less energy each year per pint of yogurt, increasing his profit margin. And by investing some of those energy savings in forestry projects that trap carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, in the atmosphere, he has reduced the company's net manufacturing emissions of carbon dioxide to zero, he says.

''Forget the moral principles, forget our children, forget the flooding of South Florida, forget malaria,'' he said, ticking off reasons to fight global warming. ''We are willing to support this strictly on the economics.''

Stories like this have gripped President Clinton's attention and prompted him to promise that the transition to an economy that relies far less on carbon fuels will be essentially painless and can begin today.
