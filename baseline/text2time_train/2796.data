The death of James E. Davis in the Council chamber of New York's most important municipal building shocked the city, provoked an outpouring of anger and sorrow and raised questions about basic security at public buildings.

But the murder of Mr. Davis, a Brooklyn councilman previously unknown to most of the city, has also pushed his family, barely known beyond a small circle in Brooklyn, into an unfamiliar spotlight.

Geoffrey A. Davis, the councilman's brother, first publicly raged over the killing, then promptly announced his desire to run for his brother's seat, a decision that upset some members of the extended family. The councilman's mother, tugged by grief and a sense of duty, has lent public support to her son, but has also tried to broker family peace and to contend with an array of politicians and handlers descending on the suddenly high-profile race in central Brooklyn.

''It has been difficult,'' Thelma Davis, the mother of the late councilman, said in an interview yesterday. ''But we are a strong family. We support each other.''
