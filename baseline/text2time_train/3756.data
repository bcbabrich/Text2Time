Nearly half a million people gathered on the Las Vegas strip tonight to ring in the new year and watch the Hacienda Hotel implode.

The implosion, the centerpiece of a celebration that rivaled New York's, was preceded by 4 minutes of fireworks that used 3,000 aerial shells, a pyrotechnic waterfall and a fireball off the rooftop of the hotel moments before the building crumpled.

The 9 P.M. implosion coincided with midnight on the East Coast.

Mark Loizeaux, the president of Controlled Demolition, which carried out the implosion, said it was the first time the company had tried such a project in conjunction with a New Year's Eve celebration. The 11-story, 900-room hotel will be replaced by a 4,000-room hotel and casino.

After the implosion, thousands of people headed north on the four-mile-long strip to the Treasure Island and Mirage casinos to watch live bands and join in a second countdown, to midnight Pacific Standard Time.
