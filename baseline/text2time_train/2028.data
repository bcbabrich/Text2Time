Former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson announced today that he, too, will join the G.O.P. field of contenders for the party’s nomination.

He spoke to ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on “This Week” this morning. He has been spending a lot of time in Iowa these last few months, with a favorite line that there’s not a real conservative in the field. (Watch the video.)

Unlike a possible contender with the same surname — former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson, this former governor and former head of Health and Human Services doesn’t have the same name recognition at this early stage of the primary game. But he says he feels things are coalescing.
