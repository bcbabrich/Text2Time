It was the turn of the inconsistent Devils to play well, and tonight they did so in smashing fashion, knocking off the defending Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins, 7-4, at the Civic Arena.

Scott Stevens and Valery Zelepukin led the Devils with two goals apiece. Aleksei Kasatonov, Laurie Boschman and Dave Barr (empty net) also had goals for New Jersey, which posted its first victory in its last nine games against Patrick Division opponents.

Kevin Stevens, Jaromir Jagr, Mario Lemieux and Joey Mullen had the goals for the Penguins against Craig Billington, who made 24 saves and improved his record to 7-1-1.

The victory for the Devils took on an extra dimension because of the recent success of the Penguins. Pittsburgh scored 30 goals and allowed only 9 in its previous 4 games, all victories, and the Penguins were on the move into the top of the division. Tops in Goals
