When a piece of Giuseppe Soffiantini's right ear arrived by mail at the office of a top Italian newscaster last week, the debate over Italy's kidnapping laws took on new urgency.

It was not the first time that the kidnappers of the 62-year-old businessman had sent such gruesome evidence to prove that their victim was still alive. Last November, five months after he was seized at his house outside the northern Italian city of Brescia, his family received a piece of his left ear -- strengthening their conviction that if they wanted to see him alive, they would have to pay ransom.

But under Italian law, families are barred from paying ransom or negotiating with kidnappers, except with the permission of a prosecutor and the cooperation of the police. In fact, the 1991 law, unique to Italy, goes one step further and imposes an automatic and obligatory freeze on assets belonging to the kidnapped victim's family.

The idea was to discourage Italy's kidnapping gangs, whose exploits included the 1973 kidnapping of John Paul Getty 3d and the kidnapping in 1992 of an 8-year-old Egyptian boy, Farouk Kassam. In both cases, parts of their ears were sliced off.
