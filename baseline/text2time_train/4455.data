The Xoma Corporation, a biotechnology company based in Berkeley, Calif., said today that its chairman, Steven C. Mendell, had resigned to become president and chief executive of Prizm Pharmaceuticals Inc. in San Diego. Mr. Mendell will join Prizm, a privately held company, in mid-May.

At Xoma, Mr. Mendell, 51, will be succeeded by John L. Castello, 57, who joined the company as president and chief executive last year. Mr. Mendell, who joined Xoma in 1984, previously held those titles. The company's founder, Patrick J. Scannon, 45, continues as vice chairman of scientific and medical affairs.

Xoma shares closed today at $7.50, down 12.5 cents, in Nasdaq trading. Move Was Expected

Mr. Mendell's departure had been expected since Mr. Castello joined the company. Xoma shares have been depressed since the Food and Drug Administration declined last spring to approve the company's flagship drug, E-5, for the treatment of sepsis, an often fatal bacterial infection. The drug showed effectiveness only in a subgroup of patients that could not be readily identified in advance.

In a telephone interview, Mr. Mendell said that his move was part of a plan initiated two years ago. At that time, Xoma began its search for a seasoned pharmaceutical executive to manage the company as its first products approached the market.
