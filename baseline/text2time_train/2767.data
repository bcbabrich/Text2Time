The economic summit that begins today in the French Alps -- the first meeting since the war in Iraq between Mr. Bush and European leaders who opposed it -- is the start of a new effort to revive globalization. It is the annual meeting of the Group of 8, which includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States.

Beyond the disagreements over Iraq, the United States and Europe have had a number of clashes over trade. Europe, for example, opposed genetically modified foods and criticized steel tariffs and tax benefits for exporters like Boeing in the United States. The recent decline in the dollar has also made life difficult for European companies that had become accustomed to the effective price edge on their goods while the dollar was higher.

After the Évian meeting, the next step in the trade talks, known as the Doha round, will be in Cancún, Mexico, in September. In Cancún, differences over agricultural subsidies and drug patents will be more clearly on display than they are this week, as negotiators, who have fallen behind schedule, determine whether they can meet their own deadline of signing a new pact by 2005.

In the meantime, officials from the United States and Latin America will continue their fitful discussions about creating a trade zone for the Western Hemisphere similar to one that exists in North America.

''All the trade negotiations are in trouble,'' said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., the president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington and a former trade negotiator. The steps taken during the last decade ''have been so successful that we've gotten down to the final, difficult issues.''

Bush administration officials take a more positive view, saying they remain committed free traders despite their support last year for new steel tariffs and farm subsidies. Officials cite successes in the war on terrorism, which they say are removing a major obstacle to the movement of people and goods, and recent trade pacts with Chile and Singapore. Those pacts are part of a strategy that Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, calls competitive liberalization, in which the administration seeks to maintain free-trade momentum, even if global talks bog down.

John B. Taylor, the under secretary of the Treasury in charge of international affairs, said: ''You take steps forward and move back. That's always the case.'' Over all, he added, ''the trends are good.''
