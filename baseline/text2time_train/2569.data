The Security Council unanimously backed a peacekeeping mission of 6,700 soldiers and 1,622 police officers for Haiti to succeed the United States-led interim force that has been there since February. The new multinational force, to be led by Brazil, is to take over on June 1. Despite a request from Secretary General Kofi Annan to give the force a two-year mandate, the Council decided to review the mission after six months. United Nations diplomats have had difficulty assembling the force, but Stuart Holliday, an American envoy, said, ''We think that this will be an important step in getting potential troop contributors to come forward.''
