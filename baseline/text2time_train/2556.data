BY pointing readers to the Web's newest and best bits, Web logs offer a way to cut through online clutter. But now that there are millions of blogs, what was once a solution to the information glut has started to become part of the problem. So perhaps inevitably, sites and services have popped up that add another level to the information food chain by digesting the Web digests.

The latest such site, Kinja, is scheduled to open to the public today at www.kinja.com. The site automatically compiles digests of blogs covering subject areas like politics and baseball. Short excerpts from the blogs are included, with links to the complete entries on the individual blog sites. After signing up for a free account with Kinja, users can enter the addresses of their favorite blogs and generate a digest -- a customized blog of blogs.

The site is designed for people who may have heard about Web logs but are not sure how to start reading them, said Nick Denton, Kinja's president, whose small blog-publishing empire includes the New York gossip site Gawker (gawker.com).

''Everyone has this illusion that Web logs have taken the world by storm,'' Mr. Denton said, ''but Web logs have probably only reached 10 percent of the Internet population. Our goal is to reach the remainder.''
