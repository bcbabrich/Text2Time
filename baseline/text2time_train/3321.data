Early results of a referendum on Uganda's political future showed today that more than 80 percent of those voting want to continue with the current ''no party'' system advocated by the nation's president.

But opponents of the president, Yoweri Museveni, declared victory, saying the turnout was far too low for him to claim a strong mandate. His opponents had called for a boycott of a referendum on whether to continue the so-called Movement system or return to a multiparty system.

Based on returns counted by this evening, just 40.5 percent of registered voters took part, far less than the roughly 75 percent in the 1996 presidential election.

''Ugandans have spoken about the Movement system of government,'' said Cecilia Atim-Ogwal, the leader of one faction of the opposition Ugandan People's Congress. ''They have rejected it totally.''
