MORGANTOWN, W. Va. — Just pulled into town for the second straight week, and needless to say there’s a tangible difference here in the atmosphere. Along with playing for a spot in the national title game, West Virginia is also playing its arch rival, Pittsburgh.

The traffic was suffocating going toward the stadium about four hours before kickoff. And the parking lots have been full for hours, as fans had a sunny but cold day to soak in the possibilities on the outskirts of the stadium.

The Quad contributer Jed Drenning dropped by, predicting that the atmosphere would be “Syracuse in ’88 times 10,” referencing the game that West Virginia had to win in order to go to the Fiesta Bowl.

The best moment of the day so far came while waiting in traffic near the West Virginia Coliseum, Bob Huggins’s new home. A souped up Honda Accord pulled up with the widows open. The driver wore leather gloves. His music of choice? John Denver’s “Country Road,” the unofficial theme song of the Mountaineers.

The biggest news of the day actually comes from the Pitt side, where the new athletic director Steve Pederson (who is also the old athletic director) made his first significant move of his second term. He gave Coach Dave Wannstedt a three-year contract extension, securing him at the university until 2012. Wannestedt is 15-19 in his first three seasons at Pitt. Everyone in Morgantown thinks that record will be 15-20 after tonight, and that “Country Road” will be blaring from more than a few speakers around town.
