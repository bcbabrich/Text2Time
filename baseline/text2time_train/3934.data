The 29-year-old Richter, who missed a month of action after tearing a thigh muscle in January 1992, has won five consecutive games. He is 11-1-2 in his last 14 outings and was brilliant again Saturday night, stopping 33 of 36 shots. He made several terrific saves early against Edmonton that altered the tempo of the game. The Rangers, buoyed by Richter, turned their offense loose and took a 5-0 lead against Edmonton goalie Bill Ranford before the first period was over.

Richter has been the backbone to the Rangers' ascension this month, often protecting a narrow lead when his teammates tired. And tired they often were because the Rangers tonight played their 17th game of the month, a team record. Despite the ambitious schedule, the Rangers were 11-2-3 in December going into tonight's game and had moved to the top of the N.H.L. with a 25-10-6 record, good for 56 points.

But the grind is starting to show, and as the month wound down, the rope the Rangers have been pulling was looking a bit frayed. In addition to Richter, the Rangers lost defenseman Mattias Norstrom for at least six weeks after he separated his right shoulder in the first period Saturday night.

Norstrom was injured during a pileup in front of the net. He was knocked over by Edmonton's Jason Arnott.

"I got pushed over, and I didn't have time to catch my fall," said Norstrom, whose arm was placed in a sling. "I landed half on my shoulder, half on my head.

"It's too bad when I started to play a little bit," added Norstrom, who had been scratched from the previous three games and seven of the previous nine. "It's tough luck. Hopefully it will not be five or six weeks."

Last week, defenseman Ulf Samuelsson underwent arthroscopic surgery to have chips removed from his left elbow. He may miss another week. Another defenseman, Doug Lidster, missed Saturday night's game with the flu, which forced the Rangers to rotate just five defensemen after Norstrom left. With Samuelsson and Norstrom both sidelined, the backup defenseman Aleksandr Karpovtsev will probably see much more action. Karpovtsev had played sparingly this season but did well Saturday night.
