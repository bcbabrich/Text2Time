Two boys, one with a glove, stood on the field behind home plate Wednesday and watched Mets left fielder Jason Bay hit a batting-practice pitch so hard that one of the boys was sure the ball would leave Citi Field.

“Aww, that is gone! Home run!” the boy said.

The ball, confronted by the humidity in the air and the roominess of the park, died at the warning track.

“I thought that was gone!” the boy said.

He was not the first to be fooled.

Bay hit six batting-practice home runs, and Ronny Paulino hit the facing of the second deck in left field. Jason Pridie hit the facing in right. But even batting practice, with easy 40-foot pitches, was hardly a power show for the Mets.

Besides being short-handed, or partly because they are short-handed, the Mets have become home-run-challenged. They took a 10-game streak without a home run into Wednesday’s game against Pittsburgh, their longest such streak in 21 years.

The Mets went a team-record 17 games without a home run from Aug. 27 to Sept. 13, 1980. That 1980 team, which went 67-95, also had streaks of 13 and 12 games without a home run, according to Baseball-Reference.com.

Their current streak ended in the eighth, when Justin Turner hit one to left — perhaps the only highlight in a 9-3 loss. Turner’s shot also ended a 10-game streak without a home run at Citi Field. The last time they did that at home was from Sept. 9-20, 1979, when they played at Shea Stadium.

Both streaks underline the continuing debate about Citi Field, whose large dimensions and high walls in left field have seemed to prove vexing, in particular, to David Wright and Bay. They have also raised questions about whether the Mets should move home plate out or bring the fences in.

“To me, it’s a perfect park, because I’m not a home run hitter,” center fielder Angel Pagan said. But Wright and Bay are.

Daniel Murphy had been the last Met to hit a home run, on May 20, but that was at Yankee Stadium. Pridie had been the last Met to hit a home run at Citi Field, on May 6 against the Dodgers. The Mets entered the day with 37 home runs, fewer than any National League team except Houston. “I think it’s the result of the lineup,” Mets Manager Terry Collins said before the game, referring to injuries to Wright and Ike Davis. “I actually have not seen guys who look like they’re overswinging.”

“It’s difficult for me to have an opinion on it,” he added in reference to Citi Field.

Pagan can offer recent examples of how it cuts both ways. He made a magnificent running catch near the 415-foot sign in right-center field to help preserve the Mets’ victory over the Pirates on Monday, but he hit a shot near the same spot that was caught Tuesday.
