Accordingly, many CBS programs are skewed toward an older audience, especially women. These include "Murphy Brown," "Designing Women," "Evening Shade," "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill," "Knots Landing" and "Brooklyn Bridge," as well as news such programs as "60 Minutes" and "48 Hours."

It is CBS's view, one not fully shared by the other networks, that certain programs, like "Murder, She Wrote," attract advertisers because they lure both older viewers and unusually wealthy ones. Mr. Poltrack said that "Murder, She Wrote" was in the top five shows last year among viewers 55 and older, while it ranked 108th among adults 18 to 34. But the average household income for the series' older audience was an unusually high $60,000, and a sizable number of the viewers were college-educated.

"This represents a very attractive audience for products," said Mr. Poltrack. But Perry Simon, executive vice president of prime-time programming for NBC, disagrees. "For now and for the forseeable future, the younger audience will still be the most desirable audience for advertisers," he said. In addition to the "economic rationale" for programming for younger audiences, he said, there was also "the creative rationale."

"Shows that can generate heat with younger audiences tend to be shows that have a greater potential of turning into major hits," Mr. Simon said. "A show like 'Fresh Prince of Bel Air,' which has a very young audience, tends to have the potential of building into a bigger hit as children and teen-agers bring adults to the show. Shows that start off with an older audience rarely bring younger audiences in."
