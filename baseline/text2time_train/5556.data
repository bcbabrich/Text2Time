To the Editor:

With its double-page advertisement on March 21, Moscow seems eager to inform the American public of the latest policy decisions taken by the Soviet Government. General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in his address to the 27th party congress, proclaimed as a fundamental principle the ''settlement in a humane and positive spirit of the questions related to the reunification of families, marriage and promotion of contacts between people and organizations.''

As one of more than 20 Americans married or engaged to Soviet citizens and unable to be reunited with our loved ones, I am encouraged by this statement. After a 12-year relationship, my own marriage was blocked in 1979, and I have been unable to see my Soviet fiance for over six years. I hope this Soviet declaration represents a genuine commitment to re-unite separated spouses and fiances.

Certainly, one positive step toward promoting trust and understanding between our two nations could be accomplished if the Russians follow this policy statement with concrete actions. ELIZABETH A. CONDON Lynn, Mass., March 24, 1986
