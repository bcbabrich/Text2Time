VARIETY PUZZLE — For those of you just joining us, the deal here is that this particular variety puzzle looks like a crossword and it smells like a crossword (seriously; put your nose right against the paper or screen), but it is only a crossword in the sense that it crosses words.

From there, the Puns and Anagrams puzzles, or PandAs as they are affectionately known, depart briskly from regular, American-style crosswords. The clues are written in a cryptic crossword style, but fear not: you can do this. The wonderful thing about PandAs is that the types of entries are limited to only two types. They are — wait for it — puns and anagrams. So, from a solving standpoint, if you are not sure what the clue is getting at, you have a 50 percent chance of getting it right, because you already know that you either need to groan or anagram something. Those are pretty good odds, in my opinion.

Let’s look at some examples. If you are looking for a toehold, I personally find it easiest to look for a clue that needs to be anagrammed. Your mileage may vary, of course.

Each anagram clue reads like a sentence, but is actually divided up into parts: one part is a definition of the ultimate entry, and the other part needs to have the letters changed around to make up the entry. So, at 42 Across, we have the mysterious clue, “No gay anguish,” and the word “anguish” is the definition (We can assume that “No gay” is not the definition, because it doesn’t really have any meaning.) What five letter entry could possibly mean “anguish”? Just anagram what’s left: “No gay” anagrams to AGONY.

Drop that into the grid and feel very proud of yourself. You’d be surprised how much of the puzzle you can fill in that way, and then you can solve the rest of the puzzle based on how many letters you already have, plus you already know that the rest of the puzzle will wind up being puns. The only downside to that is that the rest of the puzzle will be puns, and no one deserves to have to do that much groaning all in one fell swoop. But at least you’ll have completed the puzzle.

Oh, and the puns: at 29 Across, we have the clue “Scams at the pump by Frenchman,” which I am dedicating to my friend and colleague, Yahoo News national correspondent Matt Bai. Matt deeply resents any clue or entry that happens to be in French, mostly because he seems to have slept through his language classes in high school. But I would bet that even Matt could get this one. I needed some crossings, but somewhere along the way it occurred to me that the name Gascon was French, and that the answer had to be plural because the clue (“Scams”) was plural. Let’s take a closer look at that: if you divide GASCONS into two words, the answer turns out to be GAS CONS, the very scams we were hunting for. I’m fairly confident I will be hearing from Matt later today.

One more, because I think you’ll be entertained by this: 35 Across’s clue is “E taxi T,” which looks like gibberish, right? It’s not, I promise. Here’s how I got it: as soon as I saw the word “taxi,” I thought CAB. First, I tried dropping it in between the E and the T, but ECABT makes no sense. Next, I looked at the placement. “Taxi” in inside the E and the T, so what if we said that literally? Turns out that the answer is CAB in ET, or CABINET.

To recap, Puns and Anagrams are a ton of fun, but more than that, they are a gateway drug to cryptic crossword puzzles, which are multiple tons of fun. Give them a try.
