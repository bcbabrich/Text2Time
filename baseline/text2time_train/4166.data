Dr. Joseph B. Cramer, the founding director of the division of child psychiatry at the Albert Einstein School of Medicine in the Bronx, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. Dr. Cramer was 80.

A psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, Dr. Cramer spent much of his career forging links between the fields of psychiatry and pediatrics. He contributed chapters on childhood psychiatric disorders to more than half a dozen books.

Dr. Cramer was raised in Rochester and was a graduate of the University of Rochester and New York Medical College.

He is survived by two daughters, Carol, of Manhattan, and Mai Cramer Ward, of Massachusetts.
