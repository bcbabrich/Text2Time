Capping a splurge of individual honors he has not known since his Heisman Trophy season of 1986, Vinny Testaverde today got the one that means the most to him as a pro: his teammates voted him the Jets' most valuable player.

The quarterback with the 12-1 record as a starter had never been named his team's most valuable player in a career that stretched to Tampa Bay, Cleveland and Baltimore.

''I tell you what, it feels pretty good to have your teammates vote for you,'' Testaverde said. ''It probably means more to me than any other award because it comes from your teammates.''

Testaverde is the first Jets quarterback since Ken O'Brien in 1985 to be voted the most valuable player. It came a day after he became the first Jet to be named one of six finalists in the Miller Lite Man of the Year Award, an official National Football League presentation, and was voted the American Conference's offensive player of the month a second straight time.
