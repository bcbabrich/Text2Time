PHILADELPHIA â€” With Ike Davis continuing to play well, the chances of Daniel Murphy returning to the Mets as their regular first baseman are becoming increasingly remote. So the Mets are considering sending Murphy to Class AAA Buffalo, where he will work on other positions, such as second base and left field, with the hope that he can add to their depth as a utility player.

The process could take a long time, especially at second base, even though Murphy played at the position in the Arizona Fall League. Murphy is recovering from a right knee sprain and just started playing in extended spring training games Friday.
