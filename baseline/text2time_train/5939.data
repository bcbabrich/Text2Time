L ong before the doors opened at the OTB parlor on John Street yesterday, the line of bettors stretched for part of a furlong toward Nassau Street. They stood with Racing Forms in their hands and what passed for hopeful expressions on their faces.

It was the first day of operations for the office, No. 147 in the city's Offtrack Betting system. The opening of a parlor has become an event. It was only the second this year. In fact, there are eight or nine fewer betting offices now than several years ago, reflecting a malaise that lingers like a tapped-out player.

''A $2 bet is a $2 bet is a $2 bet,'' said Sam Kanchuger, an OTB spokesman. ''It's a bad paraphrase of Gertrude Stein. But it's getting very hard to keep the growth going.''

By that, Mr. Kanchuger means that rent and salaries are going up faster than the OTB handle. In the 1980 fiscal year, $893 million was bet at offtrack windows. That dropped the next year to $869 million. It was back up in fiscal 1982, ending last June, but the $882 million was still below the 1980 figure.
