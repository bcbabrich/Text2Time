LONDON — The French police searched Renault’s headquarters on Wednesday, as part of a misconduct investigation into Carlos Ghosn, the automaker’s former chairman and chief executive.

Renault confirmed the raid at the headquarters in Boulogne-Billancourt, just outside Paris. “We are fully cooperating with the authorities,” Astrid de Latude, a spokeswoman for the company, said. She declined to provide any further details about the search.

The search, which started in the morning, was linked to an investigation into the financing of Mr. Ghosn’s marriage reception at the Chateau of Versailles, said Emmanuelle Lepissier, the chief administrative officer of the public prosecutor's department in Nanterre, which is overseeing the investigation.

French news media had earlier reported that the raid was tied to the Ghosn case. Renault has referred information to prosecutors that Mr. Ghosn, who headed the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi car alliance and who was arrested in November on suspicion of financial misconduct, may have misused company money to finance a lavish Marie Antoinette-themed party at Versailles in 2016 to celebrate his second marriage and his wife’s 50th birthday.
