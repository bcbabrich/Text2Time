Verizon, the state's largest telephone company, announced yesterday that it would not be selling its phone lines in upstate New York anytime soon. "Verizon is suspending discussions with potential buyers related to upstate New York access lines while we continue to evaluate strategic options," said the company, whose phone lines upstate are not nearly as profitable as its lines in the New York City area, in an advisory sent to its New York employees. Critics of the potential sale had expressed concern that it might have endangered jobs, service quality and universal telephone service. Michael Cooper (NYT)
