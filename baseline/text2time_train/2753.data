Also, some state officials argue that gambling causes more problems than it solves.

''As a business, gaming has a tendency to absorb disposable income, especially from the poor,'' said Kumar P. Barve, a Gaithersburg Democrat who is majority leader of the House of Delegates in Maryland, where the House has voted to study Mr. Ehrlich's proposal for slot machines at tracks.

In New Hampshire, a bill to create a video lottery is alive in the legislature but not likely to survive the veto of Gov. Craig Benson, a first-term Republican who opposes gambling.

Other politicians have contented themselves with symbolic stands. Colorado just enacted a law that extends the hours and days of offtrack betting at greyhound tracks, a change expected to raise a modest $1.4 million to restore a program for home nursing care.

Gov. Bill Owens, a second-term Republican, let it become law without his signature, to reflect his ''strong opposition to gambling,'' said his spokesman, Dan Hopkins. But with a projected deficit of $869 million for 2004 and cuts that have curtailed many programs, Mr. Owens did not veto the measure.

Legalized gambling in the United States grew out of the Depression, when casinos went up in Nevada as a way to spur economic development. In 1963, New Hampshire created the first state lottery. In 1988, the Supreme Court gave Indians the right to run casinos. In 1991, Iowa became the first Mississippi River state to license riverboat gambling. Now, casinos operate in 27 states. Just Hawaii, Tennessee and Utah have no form of gambling, although Tennessee is contemplating a state lottery.

New proposals are proliferating, with even cities getting into the act. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York has made clear that he has little enthusiasm for gambling, but he also left the door open to slot machines as a way of helping the city's budget problems.

In Washington, where the projected gap is $2.6 billion, keno has been a political Ping-Pong ball. Lawmakers from both parties are trying hard to kill a proposal to hold a drawing every four minutes to bring in $30 million or more over the first two years. After the Legislature failed to pass a budget by the April 27 deadline, forcing a special session starting May 12, Gov. Gary Locke, a Democrat, expressed strong support for the measure, giving it a chance to survive.
