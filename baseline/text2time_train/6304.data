Starting Monday, curtains are going up earlier at many theater ‐ district restaurants, too.

Broadway's change of cur tain time from 8:30 to 7:30 P.M. will mean a change in dining‐out patterns, and the restaurateurs who cater to the playgoing throngs are bracing for it with new menus and serving hours.

They have been going ahead with their plans de spite some antagonism to the changed time. “We feel it's wrong as an industry, but we'll support it,” Vincent Sardi, owner of Sardi's res taurant, 234 West 44th Street said recently. The qualified support was the stand of a recently formed, unofficial alliance of a dozen or so theater district restaurant owners.

Mr. Sardi expects that most theater patrons will arrive an hour earlier than usual, from 5:30 to 6 P.M., for pretheater dining. A new menu at Sardi's will offer a choice of seven pretheater “mini‐dinners” consisting of a main dish, such as chicken Sardi or canneloni, with vegetables, dessert and cof fee. The main dishes have been selected from popular items on the regular menu. Sardi's will switch to their late supper menu at 9:30 P.M., about an hour earlier than usual.

The biggest innovation seems to be at nine of the Restaurant Associates opera tions—The Four Seasons, the new La Fonda del Sol, The Forum of the Twelve Caesars, Mama Leone's, Charley O's Bar and Grill, Brasserie, Trat toria, Charlie Brown's, and Promenade Cafe.
