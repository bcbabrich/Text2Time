The Oscar race for best documentary feature came into sharp focus on Tuesday when the Academy released its shortlist of the 15 nonfiction films in contention.

The list is top-heavy with high-profile pictures like “Amy,” about the life of the singer Amy Winehouse; “The Hunting Ground,” about rape on American university campuses; and “Going Clear,” Alex Gibney’s investigation into Scientology. “The Hunting Ground,” recently broadcast on CNN, has been the subject of criticism from college officials and others who say it is filled with distortions; the director Kirby Dick and the producer Amy Ziering have stood by the film.
