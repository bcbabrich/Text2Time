After emergency rule was officially lifted in Bahrain on Wednesday, protesters who took to the streets in some places were dispersed with birdshot and teargas fired by the security forces, a rights activist told Agence France-Presse.

The activist reported that there had been clashes in three villages: Bani Jamra, Diraz and Karzakan. Video uploaded to social networking sites on Wednesday appeared to support that report.

The blogger who posted this video on YouTube said that it was filmed in Bani Jamra on Wednesday, as the security forces fired to disperse protesters chanting, “Peaceful! Peaceful!”

According to another Bahraini blogger, Abu Sayed Mujtaba, a short clip he posted on Yfrog showed protesters in the village of Diraz fleeing as shots were fired at a march there.

This secretly filmed clip appears to show the security forces firing something, possibly teargas, in the town of Karazakkan, in western Bahrain:

This brief clip is one of two said to show shots of some kind being fired at protesters in Sanabis, outside Bahrain’s capital, Manama, on Wednesday:

This video is also said to have been filmed in Sanabis on Wednesday, and shows a march and a clash between protesters and the security forces:

According to a Bahraini activist who writes on Twitter as Choco196, this video shows the wounds sustained by one protester in Sanabis, possibly from bird shot:

Despite what appears to be video evidence of clashes, Bahrain’s interior ministry posted a brief statement on Twitter denying the accounts of witnesses who told Al Jazeera that the security forces had fired at protesters.

Also on Wednesday, an Irish human rights campaigner, Mary Lawlor, reported that she was “denied the chance to testify” in a military court that is hearing a case against one of Bahrain’s leading human rights activists, Abdulhadi Alkhawaja. According to Ms. Lawlor, the American, British, French, Danish and Swedish embassies in Bahrain sent representatives to observe Mr. Alkhawaja’s trial, which is being presided over by a uniformed military officer.

Mr. Alkhawaja’s daughter, Maryam, who works for the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, reported on Twitter that her sister, Zainab, has been asked to appear at a police station in Bahrain on Thursday. After her father and husband were arrested in April, Zainab Alkhawaja, who writes on Twitter as angryarabiya, staged a hunger strike in an attempt to press Bahrain’s government to release her family members.

The Alkhawaja family has also featured prominently in a conspiracy theory promoted by some supporters of Bahrain’s royal family who claim that they were part of a plot backed, improbably, by the United States and Iran to destabilize the kingdom.

As Roy Gutman reported this week for McClatchy newspapers, the conspiracy theorists became obsessed with an American diplomat who recently left the U.S. Embassy in Bahrain, Ludovic Hood, whose job it was to record human rights violations.

The Alkhawajas and Mr. Hood were linked in a long, erratic blog post written last month for the Bahrain Independent, a Web site that features articles with headlines like, “Trust in Your King.” They were also connected in this bizarre video produced by a group calling itself Bahrain Wikieaks (which has no connection to the actual WikiLeaks):

According to the Bahrain Independent’s blogger, the theory that the Alkhawaja family’s work as human rights activists was an American plot is supported by two facts: Mr. Hood and Maryam Alkhawaja both attended Brown University and Mr. Hood greeted a group of protesters that included Zainab Alkhawaja with donuts when they came to the U.S. Embassy in March to express their outrage at the Obama administration’s support for Bahrain’s government. The blogger linked to this video report from Reuters showing the diplomat plying the protesters with donuts:

In his haste to make these connections seem significant, the blogger appears to overlook the fact that Mr. Hood graduated from Brown in 1996, when Maryam Alkhawaja was eight years old, so they are unlikely to have been classmates and that it was his job to talk to human rights activists.

As Mr. Gutman explained, by the time Mr. Hood left Bahrain last week, he had been “the subject of a weeks-long campaign of ethnic slurs and thinly veiled threats on a pro-government Web site and in officially sanctioned newspapers.”

Mr. Gutman noted that “one of the most virulent attacks” came in “an anonymous posting on a pro-government Web site that included links to photos of Hood and his wife on their wedding day and information on where Hood and his family lived.” He added:

The posting claimed that the biggest single supporter of the anti-government protests that began Feb. 14 was the political section of the U.S. embassy, working “in cooperation” with a cell of the Lebanese Hezbollah militant movement. The head of the office, the blog claimed, was “a person of Jewish origin named Ludovic Hood,” and charged: “He’s the one who trained and provoked the demonstrators to clash with the army” near the Pearl Roundabout that was the epicenter of the demonstrations. Hood also was “the one” telling the opposition of the steps they should take “to inflame the situation,” the posting claimed. The blogger called for “honest people to avenge” Hood’s role, gave the neighborhood in which he lived with his family in Manama, the capital, and promised to provide his street address. It linked to a wedding photo of Hood with his “Jewish wife.”

A State Department spokesman told The Lede that Mr. Hood would not be available for comment on his experience in Bahrain but also insisted that his return to Washington was not caused by the campaign of harassment and had been planned 6 months ago, before the protests began.

According to Mr. Gutman, Mr. Hood returned to the United States earlier than originally planned because of the threats against him and had been given security protection there. The State Department also said in a statement to McClatchy: “It is unacceptable that elements within Bahrain would target an individual for carrying out his professional duties.”
