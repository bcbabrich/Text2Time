THAT little bit of ''down home'' in Freeport the Municipal Stadium Speedway, where people watched midget and stock car races for more than half a century - apparently will not see the green flags this year.

The 10-year lease with Campi Enterprises of Freeport has expired, and Freeport Mayor William H. White said: ''I doubt if the speedway will be there in 1984. It's just not economically feasible for the village.''

Freeport stock car racing had a limited season, from the end of May to September. Races ran on Friday and Saturday nights, leaving the 13- acre, 7,500-seat track idle five days a week during the season.

Last year, the village asked the State Legislature to be allowed to sell the property to developers. Mayor White said that the village needs to increase its tax base and that the annual $70,000 to $80,000 received from the lease races, gate, parking and concessions was too little revenue. Francine Campion, a member of the citizens' advisory committee created to study options for the property, said, ''People wanted the stadium to remain open, not sold.''
