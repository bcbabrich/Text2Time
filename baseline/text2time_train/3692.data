Heavy Internet traffic slowed many on-line investment sites yesterday as fearful investors mobbed cyberspace, checking their stock prices and then sticking around to commiserate.

''All the bears are patting themselves on their backs now, saying 'We told you so!' But they don't really care, do they?'' demanded one investor on a Yahoo discussion forum called Follow the Yellow Brick Road. ''I'm back to where I was sometime in the middle of January. I'll go slit my wrists now.''

The sense of calm expressed amid market chaos by many of middle America's typical mutual fund investors was nowhere in evidence in Internet forums and chat rooms, where participants tend to be active investors and where emotion is never quite as tempered as it is in other environments.

On America Online, where chat room convention usually dictates a cheery tone, yesterday afternoon it had turned decidedly somber. Investors kept one another up to date on what analysts were saying on CNBC. (''Shoot the jerks on CNBC,'' one said, ''nothing but bears, one after another.'') A typical exchange went like this:

ROWNAROWNA: -- Hiya Cohen --- how are you doing?

CohenInvGr: -- Not good. Bleeding.

ROWNAROWNA: -- We all are.
