ANCHORAGE, Alaska, March 31 — Alaska's crippled metropolis prepared today to resume its daily living habits, interrupted Friday by the earthquake that left death and devastation in the state's south‐central sector.

Gov. William A. Egan, using a trailer here as his temporary office, appealed by radio to the pioneering spirit of Alaskans confronted with an enormous rebuilding task. He told them that although Federal aid was “the only immediate source of funds to assist our stricken communities,” much of the job of rebuilding Alaska “will be ours and ours alone.”

These were the major steps toward reconstruction that were being taken today:

¶Seismic study teams of the United States Geological Sur‐vey had under way an investigation of the areas of Anchorage hardest hit by the tremors. The city was expected to base its future physical development on the team's findings.

¶Merchants and banks whose establishments were found by building inspectors to be usable were getting ready to resume business not later than tomorrow.
