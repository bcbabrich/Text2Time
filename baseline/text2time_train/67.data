2D: No class, no class at all, I tell you. We’re not thinking about someone who is rude, though; we are thinking about someone who really has no classes to attend, and the answer is DROP OUT.

5D: “Fall guy?” is not a guy who takes the fall for a crime he didn’t commit. It’s the guy who fell from grace, along with Eve. The answer is ADAM.

26D: The official national LAOTIAN currency is called the kip.

32D: If the clue “Band aid” had a capital A in the second word and a hyphen in the middle, it would refer to the brand name bandage. In this puzzle, the thing that is aiding the band is an AMP.

36D: “Recess appointment?” was a toughie for me. I think of a PLAY DATE as something parents arrange at each other’s homes, not at school. As I remember it, recess at school was a chaotic free-for-all. You didn’t need an appointment to play with anyone.

40D: I honestly thought this was about underwear. “Boxer rebellion?” was a real thing, but with the lowercase R in “rebellion,” this clue has to be hinting at something else. The boxer in this clue is a dog, and his idea of a rebellion is a DOG BITE. My dog’s idea of rebellion is to hide the TV remote.

Constructor Notes

This one takes me quite a ways back! Although this is my sixth themeless puzzle in The Times, it was actually the second one I constructed. More than two years ago, I had enjoyed working with the layout of my first themeless and decided to try another, similar one. I started in the upper right with “I ZOMBIE,” as I had just watched the first two seasons (and fittingly, its fifth season premiered yesterday!). I remember being quite pleased with how that corner turned out, and it still stands out to me now — I especially like how the J, X and Z are each at the intersection of two 7- or 8-letter entries. I think the rest of the puzzle still looks pretty good; it’s perhaps not my flashiest puzzle ever, but I think it’s solid all around, and filled with some nice entries that are accessible to a wide range of solvers. And what’s not to like about the three instances of ‘AO’ in down entries in the lower-right section? Some clues of mine I’m particularly fond of in this one are those for 18-Across, 30-Across, 7-Down, 36-Down, 38-Down and 40-Down. That said, I’d like to give a special mention to my clue for 22-Across, which I am delighted to see in the final version of the puzzle. Not only is “The Bottle IMP” one of my all-time favorite short stories, there’s also a devilishly diabolical trick-taking card game of the same name that somehow manages to perfectly capture the feel and tension of Stevenson’s story. Both are highly recommended!
