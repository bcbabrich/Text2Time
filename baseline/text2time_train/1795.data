Charles’ Country Pan Fried Chicken, the subject of this week’s $25 and Under review, located at 2839-2841 Frederick Douglass Boulevard, marks the return of Charles Gabriel to the Harlem neighborhood where he first sold soul food, from a truck, two decades ago. Mr. Gabriel also pan-fries his superb chicken at Rack & Soul, in Morningside Heights, but for his all-you-can-eat buffet, take the B train, exiting one stop shy of Yankee Stadium. (The D or 3 train will do the trick, too.) Have you tried Mr. Gabriel’s fried chicken at either restaurant? Do you have a favorite elsewhere in the city? Post a comment below.
