EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Certain aspects of Sunday’s finale against the Buffalo Bills were uncharacteristic of the Jets this season. For one thing, they won, 30-10.

They ran the ball extremely well and kept quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick on his feet. The defense muffled the typically high-scoring Bills, who did not have their starting quarterback, Tyrod Taylor, and who lost running back LeSean McCoy to an ankle injury in the first half. Cornerback Darrelle Revis, the Jets’ marquee player of recent years, made his first interception of the season.

None of this matched the profile of a team that had underperformed in about every aspect in which performance is analyzed in the sport, which is why the Jets had to clarify after the game that Coach Todd Bowles and General Manager Mike Maccagnan would not be fired.

That decision was confirmed by a team employee with knowledge of the plans, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. Several reporters approached the team owner Woody Johnson after the game to ask whether Bowles and Maccagnan would return for a third season, but Johnson walked briskly out of the stadium without commenting.
