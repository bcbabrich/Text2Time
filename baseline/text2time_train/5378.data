So, why aren't Ford and the other American auto manufacturers jumping up and down with joy? First of all, we probably erred in not pointing out that what we really meant was manufacturing cars in the United States from largely American-made parts and components - not merely assembling ''made in Japan'' auto kits in Tennessee, Kentucky or Ohio. NOW, about 93 percent of Ford's domestic vehicle content comes from North America. Unfortunately, that is not the case for the North American auto industry overall.

In 1970, the average domestically manufactured content stood at 87 percent. Now, that percentage stands at about 73. The projection for 1990 has average American content falling to 65 percent. This drop translates into 200,000 jobs lost in auto manufacturing between 1970 and 1990 and another 400,000 jobs in allied industries. This is a dangerous trend that is undermining our industrial and technological base. And it is happening in numerous other key manufacturing sectors as well.

To make matters worse, Japanese and Korean cars will also be assembled in Canada for shipment into the United States - aggravating trade relations all the way around.

When we look to the future, we see projections that, by 1990, Japan will be producing 8.3 million more motor vehicles than its domestic market will absorb. Where will they go? More than 30 nations have import restrictions on motor vehicles, making it logical to expect an even greater competitive crush for share in the highly profitable American market. Even though American automakers' productivity has improved by 6 percent a year over the last six years -proving that we can compete -something has to give.

While the trade deficit is expected to drop this year, it will still remain alarmingly large. Because of its size, the bilateral deficit with Japan gives us special reason for concern. But there are some other worries that are not far behind. The bilateral deficit with Taiwan is already up to $15 billion. South Korea's aggressive export plans have turned that country into a surplus nation overnight. And these nations show little inclination to adjust their substantially undervalued currencies.

Whether for reasons of commerce, world politics or common defense, Japan is important to us. So are South Korea, Taiwan and Europe. We benefit if our trading partners grow strong - but not if they grow strong at our great expense.

Our trading partners have to understand our position. And the Federal Government, likewise, must make correcting the trade deficit a top priority. Almost every foreign governmment weighs the impact of its decisions on the industrial sector. That is not the case here. Why shouldn't it be?
