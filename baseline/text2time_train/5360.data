The State Senate president defended proposed legislation today that would ban handguns in New Jersey, while opponents vowed to fight the measure.

''We are paying a huge price for the proliferation of handguns in this society, and not just in economic terms,'' the Senate president, John F. Russo, said at a hearing here. ''We can never put a price tag on the lives of hundreds of New Jerseyans who lose their lives every year in handgun violence.''

Senator Russo was greeted by jeers as he addressed more than 400 people at the second public hearing sponsored by the Senate Law, Public Safety and Defense Committee, which was held at the Camden campus of Rutgers University.

One person waved a green sign that read, ''Ban Russo, Not Handguns.'' 'Infringing on My Rights'

''He's infringing on my rights as a citizen,'' said Steve McCoy, 23 years old, of Toms River. ''I consider shooting targets not a criminal offense.''
