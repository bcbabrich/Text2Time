On a somber day for General Motors, one person was celebrating the automaker’s bankruptcy: the left-wing filmmaker Michael Moore.

Mr. Moore, who made the anti-G.M. movie “Roger & Me” in 1989, has long decried the company’s plant closings and layoffs — especially in his hometown of Flint, Mich. So on Monday he might just as well have been dancing on the company’s grave.

In a posting on his Web site, Mr. Moore wrote: “It is with sad irony that the company which invented ‘planned obsolescence’ — the decision to build cars that would fall apart after a few years so that the customer would then have to buy a new one — has now made itself obsolete.”

But Mr. Moore was just warming up to express his glee over the bankruptcy. Here’s a sample:

So here we are at the deathbed of General Motors. The company’s body not yet cold, and I find myself filled with — dare I say it — joy. It is not the joy of revenge against a corporation that ruined my hometown and brought misery, divorce, alcoholism, homelessness, physical and mental debilitation, and drug addiction to the people I grew up with. Nor do I, obviously, claim any joy in knowing that 21,000 more GM workers will be told that they, too, are without a job. But you and I and the rest of America now own a car company! I know, I know — who on earth wants to run a car company? Who among us wants $50 billion of our tax dollars thrown down the rat hole of still trying to save GM? Let’s be clear about this: The only way to save GM is to kill GM. Saving our precious industrial infrastructure, though, is another matter and must be a top priority. If we allow the shutting down and tearing down of our auto plants, we will sorely wish we still had them when we realize that those factories could have built the alternative energy systems we now desperately need. And when we realize that the best way to transport ourselves is on light rail and bullet trains and cleaner buses, how will we do this if we’ve allowed our industrial capacity and its skilled workforce to disappear?

Mr. Moore’s proposal: Forget building cars and trucks, even those that are smaller and more fuel-efficient. Instead, Mr. Moore wrote, the government should convert the factories of G.M. and other automakers over to producing mass transit.

Why? “The products built in the factories of G.M., Ford and Chrysler are some of the greatest weapons of mass destruction responsible for global warming and the melting of our polar icecaps,” Mr. Moore wrote.

Meanwhile, another scourge of G.M., the consumer lawyer Ralph Nader, assailed the G.M. bankruptcy and reorganization as “the product of a secretive, unaccountable, Wall Street-minded government task force.”

Like Mr. Moore, Mr. Nader deplored the loss of G.M. jobs and the cutbacks in workers’ wages and benefits.

But Mr. Nader, whose 1965 book “Unsafe at Any Speed” help bring about the demise of the Chevrolet Corvair, is also worried about the further availability of liability claims against G.M.

“Victims of defective GM products may find themselves with no legal avenue to pursue justice,” Mr. Nader said in a statement. “In the Chrysler bankruptcy, with complete disregard for the real human lives involved, the Obama task force and auto company have maneuvered effectively to extinguish the product liability claims of victims of defective cars.”
