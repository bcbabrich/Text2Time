Why do they do it? Why do real-estate developers and other big business interests in New York contribute to political campaigns, contribute so generously that their largess can still stun the uninitiated? (And sometimes the initiated.) The question is as fundamental as such matters get in politics. The answers are, as recent hearings before a state panel demonstrated, not so simple.

For two days, a glittery roster of developers, the newest category of New York City celebrity, testified before the State Commission on Government Integrity to explain, under oath, why they give money to public officials, especially members of the city's powerful Board of Estimate -Mayor Koch, Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin, City Council President Andrew J. Stein and the five borough presidents.

They touched on everything from the idealistic to the cynical, from civic responsibility to fondness for a candidate (and sometimes the candidate's rival, too). Some testified that they contributed on the advice of their public relations consultant, and still others said they were afraid of retaliation if they did not make contributions.

The one interpretation that none provided, and all rejected, was the most negative and seemingly the most plausible: They give to get. It certainly looks that way. Consider the following cases:

* Robert Pressman, executive vice president of Barneys New York, the retail company, testified that the Pressman family corporations contributed $5,000 to the Bronx Democratic Committee in January 1985; $10,000 to City Council President Andrew J. Stein on March 8, 1985, and $20,000 to Mr. Koch on April 28. Campaign records show another $5,000 contribution to the Mayor in May. It was on Feb. 28, 1985, that the Board of Estimate approved a plan for Barney's expansion. The contributions and the power of each board member to vote on the plan had ''nothing to do with each other,'' Mr. Pressman testified.
