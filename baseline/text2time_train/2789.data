Stocks End Second Quarter With Best Gains Since 1998

The stock market posted its best quarterly performance since the end of 1998, producing the most encouraging rally since the long slide began in 2000.

The 14.9 percent climb in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index for the three months was the eighth-best quarterly performance since World War II. The 12.4 percent increase in the Dow Jones industrial average and the 21 percent gain in the Nasdaq composite index resulted in their best quarters since the last three months of 2001. Although technology stocks led the way, the breadth of the rebound was enormous. [Page A1.]
