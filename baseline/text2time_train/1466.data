Sony Pictures Entertainment, which last year cut 250 jobs or about 3.5 percent of its workers, said it was a planning a new round of job reductions that could total an additional 6.5 percent of its global workforce.

The new cuts were disclosed in a message to employees from Michael Lynton, the company’s chairman, and Amy Pascal, its co-chairwoman, on Monday. The cuts are expected to total an additional 450 out of about 6,800 employees, according to an executive who was briefed on the situation but spoke on the condition of anonymity because of studio policy.

In addition, about 100 jobs that are now unfilled will be eliminated, the executive said. Most employees whose jobs will be cut are to be notified in March.



In their letter to employees, Mr. Lynton and Ms. Pascal said the cuts would be spread across the studio’s divisions, though most would be in its home entertainment and information technology operations. A steady decline in DVD revenue has forced Hollywood studios to cut staff and look for ways to consolidate operations.

“The business is going through a rough period of trial and transition,” said the two executives, whose statement pointed to the growth of piracy and the effect of social media on film viewing as factors challenging studios.

“We have an obligation to take the steps necessary to get through it,” they said.
