To the Editor:

In "Failure, by the Numbers" (Op-Ed, Sept. 24) Paul Spector asks "Why do we spend so much for less service and shorter life expectancy?" That average life expectancy in the United States ranks behind 17 other countries he cites as evidence of the failure of our health care system. This is simplification to the point of being misleading.

Life expectancy, as Mr. Spector says, is not a function solely of health care. Indeed, violence, substance abuse and accidents are factors in this country. Life expectancy as a measure of our health care system is an incomplete yardstick.

Mr. Spector's other major point is that "other industrial countries deliver more health care than we do." His evidence on hospitals is that "the average stay in countries for which data were available was twice as long as in ours: 12.9 days compared with 6.5 days."

The decrease in length of hospital stay in the United States reflects advances in the quality and effectiveness of health care in this country. It represents care at lower cost and certainly at much greater convenience to the patient. To criticize our health care system based on what should be the most striking evidence of its quality points to a lack of understanding of the problem.
