President Bush today reluctantly signed into law a measure creating an independent inspector general within the Central Intelligence Agency.

Creation of the new inspector general's office, similar to those that review other Government agencies' programs and seek out abuses, was part of a broader bill authorizing intelligence activities for the coming year.

In a statement, Mr. Bush, a former Director of Central Intelligence, said the new post ''could impair the ability of the C.I.A. to collect vitally needed intelligence information by creating a perception that confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.''

But the President said his objections were eased by a provision allowing the Director of Central Intelligence to kill any investigation he believed might compromise national security.
