John Faso not only responded to his being labeled an “Andrew” yesterday, but he also spent time discussing his property tax cut plan. At a news conference, he labeled Eliot Spitzer’s plan, which calls for a $6 billion property tax cut over three years, a “tax increase.”

How does he come up with that? Because Mr. Faso’s own plan offers tax cuts only to school districts that cap spending increases while Mr. Spitzer’s has no spending cap, Mr. Faso says that Mr. Spitzer’s cuts will be overtaken by school spending increases. On the other hand, New York City is not expected to stay within his proposed cap, which calls for annual spending increases of no more than 4 percent.
