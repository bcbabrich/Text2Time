With a .250 winning percentage, the Islanders came into tonight's game with the 25th-best record in the 26-team National Hockey League. At .295, the Ottawa Senators were ranked No. 23.

In a game worthy of both teams and both records, before 8,167 enablers, the Islanders survived a late Senator surge and escaped with a 5-3 victory.

The crowd, in a building that seats 10,575, was the smallest home gathering in the four-year history of the Senators, but none of the Islanders seemed to mind. They probably would have been happy to stay and play them again and again. The Senators have not won in their last 12 games, and only 1 of them was a tie.

When Coach Mike Milbury was asked to discuss the Islanders' next game, which will be Saturday against the Devils, Milbury replied: "No. We don't have too many to enjoy. Even though we had to hang on at the end, it was good."
