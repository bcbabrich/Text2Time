With the growing popularity of original-instruments performances of 19th-century compositions, a backlash is brewing from jealous standard-instruments performers, polemicists from within the movement and plain old thoughtful listeners, dismayed at gushing hype. Even Roger Norrington and his London Classical Players, recently hailed as the best of the bunch, have received their share of brickbats.

Sunday afternoon and Monday evening, Mr. Norrington and his London musicians returned to Avery Fisher Hall for their second New York visit. Each program offered Beethoven's Fourth Symphony, which duplication clearly cut down attendance by those who might have gone to both concerts.

The Monday concert included Mendelssohn's "Scottish" Symphony, the most "modern" score on both programs, but the Beethoven before the intermission almost played into the hands of the nay-sayers. It was hardly bad, given the skills of these musicians (still several years ahead of their American counterparts in technical ability and ensemble coherence) and Mr. Norrington's charming musicality, at once brisk and relaxed.

But Beethoven is by now familiar in this guise, and Mr. Norrington's snappy, rigid approach can disappoint those who yearn for more grandeur and flexibility. One of the natural horn players was having trouble, too, and while Fisher Hall is far superior in its acoustical liveliness to Carnegie for such music-making, the performances still lacked impact.
