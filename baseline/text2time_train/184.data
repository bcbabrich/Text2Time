John Legend steps into the sandals of Jesus. And Benedict Cumberbatch stars in a new movie about grief and loss.

What’s on TV

JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR LIVE IN CONCERT 8 p.m. on NBC. Celebrate Easter by watching John Legend portray Jesus. The R&B superstar will take center stage to play the son of God in Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice’s once-villified, now-canon rock musical. “I had a hard time turning down the role of Jesus Christ,” Mr. Legend told The Times. He’ll be joined at the live Brooklyn armory performance by a starry cast that includes Sara Bareilles as Mary Magdalene and Alice Cooper as King Herod. And Brandon Victor Dixon, who recently played another conflicted antagonist as Aaron Burr in “Hamilton,” will take the role of Judas.

MLB BASEBALL There may have been a big snowstorm recently, but that’s not stopping baseball from heralding the return of spring. Two games will be televised nationally on Sunday: At 1:10 p.m., the St. Louis Cardinals face the New York Mets on ESPN. And at 8:37 on ESPN, the San Francisco Giants hope to kick-start another year of Even Year Magic as they wrap up their series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, who came within one victory of winning the World Series last year. Rich Hill, who started two World Series games, gets the ball for Los Angeles.

BEVERLY HILLS DOG SHOW 6 p.m. on USA. Despite protests at other events, expect to see lots of fur on the red carpet.
