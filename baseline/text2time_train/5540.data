The McDonnell Douglas Corporation yesterday reported a 3.4 percent rise in earnings in the fourth quarter of 1985 on a 17.9 percent increase in sales.

McDonnell Douglas, which is based in St. Louis, said that net income in the latest three months edged up to $94.8 million, or $2.36 a share, from $91.7 million, or $2.28 a share, in the corresponding quarter a year earlier. Sales increased to $3.09 billion from $2.62 billion.

For the full year, McDonnell Douglas said that net income increased 6.3 percent, to $345.7 million, or $8.60 a share, from $325.3 million, or $8.10 a share, in 1984. Sales rose 18.8 percent, to $11.48 billion, from $9.66 billion. Information Systems Loss

McDonnell Douglas said full-year profit growth was curtailed by a $109.7 million loss by its information systems business, compared with a loss of $45.3 million from that line of business in 1984.
