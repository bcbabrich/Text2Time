LOUISVILLE, Ky. — The best show at this year’s Humana Festival of New American Plays, which runs here through Sunday, had an unbearable start. The first 40 minutes of Mara Nelson-Greenberg’s “Do You Feel Anger?” felt so gratingly forced, it was hard to see where the story could go. But there was a payoff, and a great one.

In this dark comedy, directed by Margot Bordelon, an “empathy coach” named Sofia (Tiffany Villarin) is sent out to train the employees of a debt-collection agency. Ms. Nelson-Greenberg doubles down on the absurdism: Sofia’s parents nickname her “little spider” because she was born with eight arms, while Eva (Megan Hill), an agency employee, cannot remember the name of the boyfriend she just broke up with. We are stuck in a collegiate version of Ionesco, and it is stultifying.

Eventually, however, the real subject emerges: the way some men feel threatened by women and demand that love and work be on their terms — or else.

Jon (Dennis William Grimes) is dumbfounded when he learns about menstruation; Howie (Amir Wachterman) has a meltdown and stops only when Sofia tells him that yes, he’s funny: “I think I just didn’t understand the joke,” she explains.
