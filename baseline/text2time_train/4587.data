Burton Vaupen, a company official, denied there was any discrimination. He said only 23 employees were dismissed last year and of those three were Japanese.

But Mr. Filicia's lawyer, Debra Raskin, insisted that the Japanese woman returning home was the only Japanese employee dismissed. Moreover, she said the complaint reflected a pattern of discrimination against United States employees in general and women in particular by Japanese-owned companies in this country.

Ms. Raskin said five other DCA employees filed a similar discrimination complaint against DCA last year and that "about a half dozen similar suits" involving other companies have been filed in other courts. Preferential Treatment

One of the dismissed DCA executives, Russell Goyette, a former group account director, contended in last year's suit that he discussed his dismissal with Toshio Naito, the president of DCA. In the complaint, Mr. Goyette quoted Mr. Naito as saying that DCA treated Japanese-born employees more favorably than American-born.

But Mr. Vaupen said the quotation was a "misunderstanding." That complaint is still pending.

DCA is a wholly owned subsidiary of Dentsu Inc. of Japan, the largest advertising agency in the world.
