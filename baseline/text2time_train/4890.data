The Indian Government has withdrawn permission for the filming of the book ''The City of Joy'' on the ground that it would show Calcutta in too negative a light.

It is also barring a European team from making a documentary on Mother Teresa. Film crews require the permission of the federal Government to work in India.

''The City of Joy,'' a $16 million film of Dominique Lapierre's nonfiction story of a Roman Catholic priest working in one of the world's worst slums, was to be directed by Roland Joffe, who also made ''The Killing Fields'' and ''The Mission.'' More than half of the film budget would have been spent in the city.

The unexpected decision by a new Government that came to power less than a month ago pledging freedom of expression and a more open society was announced recently in Calcutta by the Minister of Information and Broadcasting, Parvathaneni Upendra.
