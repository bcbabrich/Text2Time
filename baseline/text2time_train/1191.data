LOS ANGELES — Success in Hollywood can be measured in any number of ways: box-office grosses, the number of assistants you employ … the size of your theme park ride.

John Lasseter, Pixar’s chief creative officer, now has an entire “land” devoted to his “Cars” movies — 12 acres in all at a Disney park called California Adventure. James Cameron and Disney are working on a similar size “Avatar” land in Orlando. You can almost hear the grumbling from George Lucas, who has a Disney ride based on his “Star Wars” films: James Cameron gets an entire land?

Christopher Meledandri, the animation whiz behind Universal hits like “Despicable Me” and “Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax,” is still comfortably at the single ride stage, and he’s tickled just to have that. A simulator-based ride called Despicable Me: Minion Mayhem opens Monday at Universal Orlando.

Strangely enough, it’s a big deal for Universal’s parks division to build a ride based on a film made by its corporate cousin. In recent years, a shortage of hit Universal movies has forced Universal parks to build attractions around rented franchises — “The Simpsons” from Fox, “Transformers” from Paramount, “Harry Potter” from Warner Brothers.

So Mr. Meledandri is something of a corporate hero for delivering a movie popular enough to spawn not only a sequel (“Despicable Me 2” arrives next summer) but a ride. Comcast, which took over Universal last year, has high hopes that Minion Mayhem, named for the little yellow creatures in “Despicable Me,” won’t be Mr. Meledandri’s last theme park foray, either.

“We’re absolutely excited to do more of this,” Mr. Meledandri said in a phone interview. He declined to elaborate, but it’s easy to imagine him collaborating on upgrades to Seuss Landing, an aging Dr. Seuss-themed area of Universal’s Orlando resort.

Mr. Meledandri said the hardest part of converting “Despicable Me” to a ride involved the video sequences. “We found ourselves going to traditional cinematic techniques to capture emotion — a close-up, for instance — but in a ride that’s not really an option; you would lose the feeling of immersion.”
