Companies

Chrysler bought an option to get 20 percent of Gulfstream Aerospace and said the companies may merge. Chrysler said it was interested in Gulfstream's technology in the areas of aerodynamics, lightweight materials and advanced electronics. The 20 percent would cost Chrysler $127 million, and the company said that if it acquired the rest, it would pay cash. [Page 35.]

Apple Computer announced a corporate restructuring that does away with its two separate product divisions in favor of manufacturing and marketing divisions responsible for all its products. The restructuring also eliminates the day-to-day operating responsibility of co-founder Steven P. Jobs, who had been general manager and remains chairman. The restructuring is seen by Apple insiders and analysts as an attempt by John Sculley, president and chief executive, to assert his leadership to turn the company around. [35.]

Unocal registered its master limited partnership, a small portion of which it will sell to the public and some of which it will distribute as an extra dividend to its shareholders. [37.]

The Federal Home Loan Bank Board named new directors for the ailing Central Savings and Loan Association of San Diego after efforts to find a buyer apparently failed. [38.]
