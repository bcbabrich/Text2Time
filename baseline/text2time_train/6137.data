Compared to a Government bureau, the mills of the gods grind exceeding fast. In August 1973, the United States Senate ratified an international convention for the protection of endangered species of plants and animals. The Interior Department actively promoted the treaty and urged quick passage of a law for carrying out its provisions. !laving got everything it asked for, the Department has in effect sat on its hands ever since,

The convention included an appendix listing several hundred critically endangered animals. Some were aiready on this country's endangered list, hut 175 were not—and they are not to this day. They include a rare subspecies of Alaskan bear, the clouded leopard, the Indian elephant, the pronghorn antelope and the American crocodile.

For its slow‐motion reaction to a critical situation, the Department's Office of Endangered Species pleads lack of personnel and, more fundamentally, lack of money. But that explanation has only a limited validity.

No extensive investigation is required to add to this country's protected list species already declared by the treaty signatories to be endangered or seriously threatened. The little funding that might be needed can be had if the Department—and the Administration as a whole—has a genuine will to secure it. It is far more likely that the trouble stems from that interminable disease of bureaucracy—red tape.
