Usain Bolt of Jamaica set a world record for 100 meters late Saturday, running 9.72 and defeating the reigning world champion in the event, Tyson Gay of the United States, in what was billed as a preview of the Olympic final. About 6,500 fans watched the Reebok Grand Prix at Icahn Stadium on Randalls Island. The meet was televised live on ESPN2 and highlights were shown the next afternoon on CBS.

A short time earlier and not far away, Kimbo Slice defeated James Thompson by technical knockout in mixed martial arts, a sport/spectacle that is, shall we say, not quite on the International Olympic Committee’s radar screen. About 8,000 fans watched the bout at the Prudential Center in Newark. The fight card was shown live in prime time by CBS.

Two sports heading in different directions, at least in the New York area.

Icahn was filled to capacity for the Reebok, the third of four major American meets in the run-up to the Olympic trials. (A day later, 70,000 fans in Berlin watched a Golden League track meet.) The stadium is beautiful, but its modest size can be seen as emblematic of the decline of track and field as a spectator sport in New York.

As recently as a generation ago, the city was the world’s hotbed of indoor track. It had been the center of that universe for a century. For a time, Madison Square Garden hosted three major meets each season: the Millrose Games, the Olympic Invitational (later at the Meadowlands, now defunct) and the national championships (later at the Georgia Dome, now in Boston). Sellouts were the rule. Today, only the Millrose remains, and 12,000 is considered a banner turnout.

Some of today’s bigger meets are held at the armory on 168th Street, like Icahn a beautiful facility but one that, compared with the Garden, is decidedly modest in size. And yet the renovated armory is hardly a new addition to the city’s track landscape. For decades rough-and-tumble all-comers handicap races were held on what was then an unforgiving board track, starting early Friday evening and ending sometime around the time the sanitation crews finished their Midtown sweep. Columbia’s Baker Field had a bubble with a steeply banked board track that had once been the Garden’s. All the city’s college teams that didn’t have their own track — well into the 1970s, that meant most of them — worked out there cheek by jowl while dodging the occasional errant 35-pound weight that could and did punch a neat hole in the boards. When the world’s best came to town for the big Garden meets, they trained there, sometimes sharing the track with the collegiate rabble and the flying iron.

Track and its fall incarnation, cross-country, are still extremely popular in the city as participatory sports (visit Van Cortlandt Park any Saturday in October). But puzzlingly, as more people have discovered running as a way to stay in shape, fewer have taken an interest in track as a spectator sport. Long gone are the days when a Glenn Cunningham was as well known as a Babe Ruth, when Jim Ryun was as popular as Johnny Unitas.

That’s too bad. Bolt is clearly the caliber of athlete who merits the serious attention of any sports fan. At only 21 and almost 6 feet 5 inches, he seems a preternatural talent in one of track’s glamour events. His start is remarkable for a man of his size. His midrace poise belies his relatively meager experience. His finish is devastating. That he also runs the 200 (see video below) and 400, races in which his long stride is an even greater asset, makes him the most intriguing all-around sprint talent since Tommie Smith four decades ago. Combine those qualities with what is shaping up to be an epic rivalry with Gay, who has won six of their nine head-to-head races in the 100 and 200, and with his countryman Asafa Powell, whose record he broke, then throw in the fact that this is an Olympic year, and there would seem to be reason enough to start following track again, at least one 9.72-second slice of it.
