Mid-campaign, the Senator hit on what looked like a more promising tactic, hammering away at Mr. Schumer's House attendance record. Mr. D'Amato worked that vein to the point of parody, and voters might well have inferred that he was running for re-election solely because his opponent failed to show up for a routine vote on safe mammogram equipment. Mr. Schumer was clearly thrown off stride, until he discovered how many non-critical but nonetheless resonant votes on the Nassau County Board of Supervisors Mr. D'Amato missed in 1980 when he was first running for the Senate. (''Votes to Protect Seniors and Domestic Violence Victims!!!'')

Somehow, Mr. D'Amato had forgotten the most basic rule of modern campaigning, which is that the candidate must begin by searching his soul for sins on which the opposition could capitalize, and admit them first. Whatever the outcome on Tuesday, one result of this race has been to deflate the Senator's reputation as a killer campaigner. The truth is that Mr. D'Amato has made his career by running against different variations of a political marshmallow. The Democratic nominee six years ago was Attorney General Robert Abrams, a sweet man with the killer instincts of a hamster. The time before that, Mr. D'Amato's opponent was Mark Green, whose campaign had about as much money as a Russian pensioner. Meanwhile, between races, he forged non-aggression pacts against high-profile Democrats with sharp tongues, like Edward Koch and Mario Cuomo.

Mr. D'Amato's first big race, the one that made his reputation, was the 1980 campaign against Senator Jacob Javits and Representative Elizabeth Holtzman. He won the Republican primary against Mr. Javits with an infamous campaign in which he depicted Mr. Javits as an aging politician in poor health. That created the legend of Al D'Amato the ferocious attack dog. But Mr. Javits actually was in ill health, suffering from a fatal degenerative disease that took his life before the next Senate term was up. Ms. Holtzman was a woman of many fine qualities, none of which involved being a likable politician. In the end, with Mr. Javits running on the Liberal line, Mr. D'Amato beat her with 45 percent of the vote.

As a campaigner, Mr. D'Amato's real strength is his shamelessness -- he would take credit for the tide coming in -- and his desperation. He gives the distinct impression that he would do anything for a vote, change his ideology, make funny faces, clean out your cellar. It is an unnerving, but rather compelling quality for New York voters, whose normal electoral choices involve a phlegmatic incumbent and a sacrificial-lamb opponent who is possibly under indictment or living in a different state. But Mr. Schumer, who would walk a mile barefoot to do a two-minute interview with a 100-watt radio station, is right up in Mr. D'Amato's league when it comes to manic self-promotion.

The Senator specializes in surprise last-minute surges in popularity, perhaps from supporters too embarrassed to tell pollsters they plan to vote for a man whose most memorable campaign quote was ''putzhead.'' But the fact that Mr. D'Amato is harping on Mr. Schumer's antique ethics charge at this late hour suggests he is worried that the hidden D'Amato voters might not surface this year.
