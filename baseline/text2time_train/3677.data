Frankie Andreu said before the start of the Tour de France's 19th stage today that his legs were dead and that there was no point in expecting him to join a large, early breakaway.

No way, he said. No legs.

Andreu, an American rider for the United States Postal Service team, sounded convincing even though his goal in this Tour, his seventh, was identical with his goal in the first six: get in a good breakaway and win a stage. It had not happened yet, and there were only three days to go before the finish in Paris on Sunday.

A breakaway was expected by nearly all of the 96 riders left because the journey from La Chaux- de-Fonds in Switzerland to Autun in France measured 150 miles and most teams with top sprinters, like Mapei and Telekom, said that they were too tired to lead a long chase for a chance at a mass rush to the finish.

With only 14 of the original 21 teams left after the withdrawal of the last five TVM riders this morning and at least four teams intent on a restful day, the road was open to an early acceleration.
