Reports of infants born in New York City with symptoms of drug withdrawal nearly doubled in the 1987 fiscal year and continued to climb sharply during the first four months of this fiscal year, the city's Human Resources Administration said yesterday.

William J. Grinker, the agency's head, said the surge in babies with withdrawal symptoms - from 1,325 in the fiscal year ended in June 1986 to 2,521 in the fiscal year ended in June 1987 and to 1,336 in the next four months - was because of crack, which swept through the city during that time, creating a problem for which, he added, ''there is no easy answer.''

The rise in babies born to drug users has been accompanied by what the agency expects will by the end of this fiscal year be a nearly sixfold increase from 1984 in the filing of Family Court cases for abuse and neglect, to nearly 10,000. An Annual Report

The statistics were contained in an annual report released yesterday reviewing the deaths of 45 children whose families had been previously reported to the agency's child welfare division, Special Services for Children. They were among the 103 children in the city whose deaths last year were possibly related to abuse or neglect, a figure slightly below the city's average of 110 in recent years.
