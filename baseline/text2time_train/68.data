Re “Can Joe Biden Be Forgiven?,” by Lucy Flores (Op-Ed, April 30):

I believe that the reason Mr. Biden is not doing a satisfying apology to either Anita Hill or Ms. Flores (and anyone else he was too physical with) is that he is still hoping to appeal to President Trump’s male voters, and he doesn’t want his apology to be campaign fodder for Mr. Trump, however well meaning it may be.

The problem for Mr. Biden is that he may be overestimating what an apology means to men at the expense of underestimating its meaning to women.

To the Editor:

Studies have revealed that those who refuse to apologize after hurting others feel more powerful as a result. Conversely, those who do apologize feel less powerful, even as they stand to benefit by repairing a fractured relationship.

As disappointing as it may be, it should come as no surprise that both our president and those vying for his position seem oddly allergic to those two little words: I’m sorry.
