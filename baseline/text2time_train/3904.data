Lately, he has dropped the tennis, but not the running. And so, after a cup of extra-strong coffee, he walked two blocks to the long stretch of pavement on the Brooklyn waterfront where he has put in so many miles that he knows every stride-throwing hummock and dip.

He had to pull up his white socks, which had slipped to somewhere just north of his ankles. Then he decided to peel off his dark blue sweatshirt, even though it was one of those mornings when the temperature was struggling to make it out of the 40's.

Mr. Weintraub has the course figured out. He plans to jog to the Williamsburg Savings Bank in Brooklyn, about 8 miles from the starting line. ''If my pace is slowing up, I'll walk after that,'' he said. ''I'm a fast walker.'' But when he hits Greenpoint Avenue, he intends to start jogging again, right straight into Long Island City. He may do some more walking on the way to Manhattan, but by the time he is closing in on Central Park, he will be going full speed.

''You're born with your speed -- nothing you can do about it,'' he said. ''Speed doesn't mean a thing when you run 26 miles. The good runners, the fellows who teach me, they start off very fast. But it's not how you do the first 5 miles. It's not a question of the order, just finish.''

The medical director for the marathon, Dr. Andres Rodriguez, said much the same thing.

''Older people know not to push themselves to go too fast or too far, so they finish and finish fine,'' he said. ''It's the younger people who think, 'I can do it in 5 hours.' '' Asked about Mr. Weintraub, he said, ''If he feels comfortable running this distance, fine. Physiologically, he sounds like he's 50 or 60.''

Mr. Weintraub's memories are those of a much older man, though. In his apartment, he is looking at the photographs of himself and his wife on their wedding day in 1936. He is talking rapidly now, remembering his courtship and one unexpected moment. ''She gave me the ring back,'' he says. ''I thought she'd picked somebody else.''

It turned out that she had not. They were married for 57 years. But questions about their life can still be troubling. How long has it been since she died?

''I can't remember,'' he says, and there is a catch in his voice. ''I always think of her smile, her beautiful smile, and she took that with her.''
