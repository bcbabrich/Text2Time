President Hashemi Rafsanjani confirmed today that he was ready to run for a second term in June and warned the Clinton Administration in unusually dismissive terms that it was up to Washington to improve relations with his country.

At a rare news conference to which more than 70 foreign journalists were invited, Mr. Rafsanjani accused the United States of a bias against Muslims and urged the Clinton Administration to release Iranian assets that have been frozen since the country's Islamic revolution in 1979.

"The West does not want independence and freedom based on Islamic thoughts for Islamic countries," the President said. "They are confronting an important movement and they do not like it." A Harsher Tone

The news conference was apparently scheduled to draw international attention to two weeks of celebrations commemorating the 14th anniversary of the Iranian revolution. The tone was unusually harsh for Mr. Rafsanjani, who has steered Iran toward greater economic and political liberalization over the last three years.
