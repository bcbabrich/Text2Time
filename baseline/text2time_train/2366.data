A battle within the family that controls the Cablevision Systems Corporation took another turn yesterday after the company said it had ceased negotiations with Charles F. Dolan, its chairman and controlling shareholder, who had been set to acquire the assets of Voom, its troubled high-definition television operation. Cablevision said it would close Voom within 30 days.

Minutes later, Voom put out its own statement saying that Mr. Dolan and his son Thomas had told Cablevision that they were prepared to finance the continued expansion of the Voom business and that they continued to be "interested in completing the transaction." The statement quoted Thomas Dolan as saying a transaction would be in the best interests of Cablevision's shareholders.

The statement from Voom did not say that the two Dolans had financing in place. And one person involved in the transaction said the board was not willing to wait past yesterday's deadline and continue to lose money on Voom. How much additional time Charles Dolan sought from the board was not clear.

A Cablevision spokesman declined to comment. But the Voom statement was a clear sign of a continuing battle between the two sides and of Charles Dolan's anger at the board's unwillingness to support his acquisition of the assets.
