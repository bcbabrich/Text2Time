Michael Winerip's article made me wonder how many relatives of Jews trapped in Germany or Austria in the late 1930's may have received similar pleas for help. My mother, Martha Gomberg, received one -- a cable from a distant cousin in danger in Vienna. My mother gathered our family's available funds ($600, I believe) and went from Cleveland to Cuba. Somehow she managed to meet with the president-dictator, Fulgencio Batista, give him the money and ask him to issue visas for her cousin's family: a mother, father and 12-year-old son. I think she had never before been south of Ohio.

Miraculously, Batista kept his word. Our cousins arrived in Cuba on the last boat that was allowed to discharge refugees. The son was permitted to come to the United States almost immediately. He lived with us for a year until his parents were allowed to enter.

After their narrow escape from the Nazis, our cousins prospered in this country. One happy ending among so many tragic ones.
