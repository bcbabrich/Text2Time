In an electronic assault on NATO's presence in cyberspace, computer users in Serbia managed to temporarily disable the alliance's site on the World Wide Web last weekend and cause intermittent outages over the last few days, NATO officials said Wednesday.

Paul Magis, NATO's web master, said computer hackers bombarded the site in what is known as a ''ping attack,'' which twists a protocol that Internet computers use to query one another into a weapon that overloads a server with more queries than it can handle simultaneously.

As a result, anyone trying to retrieve information from the NATO site was blocked from doing so all day Saturday, and parts of Monday and Tuesday. To guard against such attacks, NATO officials said they have added an additional server and a filter to block out all ''ping'' queries.

The site has been flooded with thousands of E-mail messages a day, some of which were designed to overload NATO's computer, and some of which contained files with viruses. But the attachments containing the viruses were not opened and did not enter the computer system, Mr. Magis said.
