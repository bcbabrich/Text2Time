Feel the need to get a handle on the basic rules of soccer before the games begin? Wondering just how so many quite different games all came to be called “football”? Help is at hand, in the form of a recently published edition of modern soccer’s very first rule book, The Rules of Association Football, 1863, from the Bodleian Library at Oxford.

Earlier this week, on The Guardian’s Newsdesk podcast, Kevin McCarra, who covers what the British call football, looked at these 13 original rules and noted that the game started out as “pretty brutal stuff that allowed handling as well as kicking the ball (come back Maradona all is forgiven).” Apparently the group of former public-school boys who met at the Freemason’s Tavern in London to define the game “even debated whether hacking should be permitted on the grounds that taking the opposition’s legs from under them was manly, but in the end decided to ban it.”

By the way, The Guardian has also started a podcast devoted to the World Cup, which is well worth checking out. They’ve done three warm-up shows so far but it goes daily during the tournament and features, among others, Barry Glendenning, who writes their often very funny daily e-mail newsletter, The Fiver.
