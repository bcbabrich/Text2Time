The Giants (7-0) started preparations today for Monday night's game against the Colts (2-5) in Indianapolis not knowing who would play quarterback for the Colts.

The Giants are hardly at a disadvantage. The Colts don't know either, although they hope it will be their high-priced rookie, Jeff George.

Jack Trudeau, who had been starting, tore two of the four ligaments in his right knee in Sunday's 27-7 loss to the Miami Dolphins. He is lost for the season.

That left the Colts with George and Joe Ferguson as their remaining quarterbacks. Today, they signed Rusty Hilger as a backup, but their quarterback problems are hardly gone. Stomach-Muscle Injury
