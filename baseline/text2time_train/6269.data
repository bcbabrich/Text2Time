WASHINGTON, Nov. 1—Senator William B. Saxbe's nomination to be Attorney General ran into constitutional difficulties today, and the Justice Department conceded that “remedial legislation” would be needed before he could take office.

The apparent barrier to the Ohio Republican is posed by Article 1, Section 6, of the Constitution, the second clause of which says, in part:

“No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been encreased, during such time.”

Mr. Saxbe entered the Senate on Jan. 3, 1969, to begin his present six‐year term. On Feb. 4 that year he voted in support of a pay increase for Cabinet officers, which ultimately became law.

Although a spokesman for Mr. Saxbe contended that these circumstances would not bar the Senator from taking office as Attorney General, other sources disagreed.
