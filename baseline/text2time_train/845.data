READ--Clare Taylor, 85, died July 18 in Exeter, NH, after battling a terminal illness. She leaves Bert, her adoring husband of 53 years; sons John and Bill, daughter Wendy; sister Sarah; brother Larry and four grandchildren. She was an avid watercolorist, opera lover, tennis player, sailor, and gardener. But she will perhaps be best remembered as the "hostess-with-the-mostess," graciously entertaining friends and family from far and wide. Always positive, exceedingly generous, ever active, a loving mother and devoted wife, she will be missed by many and forgotten by few. In lieu of flowers, donate to Kirkwood Gardens, 603-968-7194 ext. 12. Memorial service: August 17, 2pm, Church Island, Squam Lake, NH.
