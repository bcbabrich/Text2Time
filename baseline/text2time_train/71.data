Even though it has been a few years since Stephen Colbert stepped out of the blowhard conservative-pundit role that he played for nearly a decade on “The Colbert Report” and into the role of, well, himself, as host of “The Late Show” on CBS, the 55-year-old’s popularity only continues to grow. His show, already No. 1 in late night, took over the top spot among viewers ages 18 to 49 earlier this year, a demographic that had long been owned by Jimmy Fallon and “The Tonight Show.” As it turns out, what Colbert and his show offer — an “explicative deconstruction of the day’s news,” as he puts it — is exactly what many people want. “It’s so confusing today,” said Colbert, who is also an executive producer on Showtime’s animated comedy “Our Cartoon President.” “And that confusion leads to anxiety, and the anxiety makes the audience want the jokes.” Which, Colbert added, is “the same reason we want to do them.”

“The Late Show” is doing very well, and there are obvious explanations you could point to: You’ve had a few years to learn how to do the job. You’re benefiting from a Trump bump. But what’s your own hunch about why the show is resonating? By the spring of 2016, we had figured out how I want to do a monologue: We never do setup, punch, setup, punch. Instead, it’s always, I’m going to tell back to you what happened today. When the presidential campaign came around in 2016, that helped focus us on the things that we most enjoyed, which is the news of the day. But you say “doing very well,” and I know you mean numerically.1 This is a long preamble to the real answer to your question: It’s almost as if the president is trying to cast a spell to confuse people so they cannot know the true nature of reality, and what we do is pick apart the way in which the [expletive] was sold to you. I think that’s why it’s going well. Our job is to identify the [expletive], and there’s never been more.

I remember Jon Stewart2 saying, when he was on “The Late Show,” that he was glad he wasn’t digging in the turd mines anymore. Is it ever dispiriting to spend so much time engaging with bad news? The metaphor that I use is that there’s this pool of radioactive sludge, which is the daily news. My job is to be lowered like carbon rods into that radioactive sludge and absorb the radiation of the insanity that happened today. Then they take me out and put me in front of the camera, and I irradiate it back at the audience at a much lower, nonlethal rad level. That’s kind of the job. It’s a transformation of the poison into something entertaining. Do I feel poisoned by doing that? Yeah, a little bit. But I get to go do the jokes. I need the audience as much as some of them say they need the show. If the show really works and it feels organic, then the poison’s drained out of me.

The suggestion there is that comedy or satire can relieve people’s tension or anxiety about the world. But as far as I can tell, no one is feeling any less tense or anxious. Do you really think the show actually performs a stress-relieving function? Momentarily. You know, my doctor has informed me that if I could drink less during the week, that would be good. Because that would be one of the things I would want to do when I go home: have myself an old-fashioned that could stun a buffalo. It’s relaxing at first, but your blood pressure actually goes up again the next day because you drank four ounces of Maker’s Mark the night before.

If we take that as a metaphor, where do you fit in it? I’m the alcohol. I might be the alcohol. I don’t know what the next day is like for anybody. If the show goes well, maybe the audience sleeps a bit better. And maybe that’s all the show should be. I have said this before, but I know that when you’re laughing, you’re not afraid.

Is that true, though? Isn’t nervous laughter a laughter that comes from fear? Nervous laughter is not the same thing as laughing, in my opinion. I would say nervous laughter is evidence that I’m right, because that is your body autonomically trying to relieve tension. If someone can do that for you from the outside, it relieves that tension and fear, and you are momentarily not afraid. If you’re not afraid, you can think, and we have to think our way out of this one.

This is bringing a line back to me that you had on election night in 2016, in that lovely monologue you gave. You said something like “the devil cannot stand mockery.”3 Right. Exactly.

I’m cynically wondering where the evidence is for that. People were making fun of every tyrant who has ever lived. Now, wait a second. You’re implying that I am saying that satire can affect politics. I will merely paraphrase Peter Cook, who said that the greatest satire of the 20th century were the Weimar cabarets, and they stopped Hitler in his tracks. I have never ever claimed that it has any effect. I have never had any illusion that what I am doing is changing the world. We do it late at night, and maybe you sleep better because of it. As a child, comedy did that for me. I lost my father and two of my brothers when I was a child.4 I was absolutely leveled. But every night I went to sleep listening to George Carlin’s “Class Clown,” “Wonderfulness” by Bill Cosby, “Richard Nixon: A Fantasy,” by David Frye. Then later Steve Martin, “A Wild and Crazy Guy” and “Let’s Get Small.” Comedy allowed me to go to bed. It gave me a moment of release and happiness. I know that’s true. That’s not the same as saying that you stop tyrants.

Is President Trump good for comedy? How do you come up with a fresh joke about him? I make no claim that we do. Sometimes it’s the same joke. But sometimes there’s still meat left on that chicken. Trump consumes the news cycle, and our mandate, as we’ve established for ourselves, is that I want to inform the audience of my opinion about what they’ve been thinking about all day. So if the news has been Orange Thanos, then I’m not going to change that. I’m going to do my best to stand in the teeth of that particular [expletive] hurricane and make jokes about how we’re all being lied to. For my own heart’s ease, I’m not going to pretend that Trump is not lying to me. The alternative is to stick your head in the sand.

That thing about not wanting to let Trump get away with a lie — is it fair to say that you feel a moral imperative behind your work? Well, when you make jokes about politicians, there’s what they say and what they do. It’s hard to make jokes about someone who says something and then kind of does it. But with a guy who points east with his words and west with his action, that’s where all the jokes live. Now, what are the things he’s lying about? If the things he’s lying about have a moral component, then your jokes will have a moral component. In other words, you don’t choose the flavor. The flavor is chosen by politics itself.

That’s sort of a general answer about the default moral nature of political satire. I was asking more specifically about whether or not you personally feel any sense of moral obligation about your work. No. I mean, I have a morality. I suppose it’s related to my Catholicity. I was raised in a devout Catholic home and bottle-fed Robert Bolt’s “A Man for All Seasons,”5 which is about how it’s important that you not let the tide of history sweep you along if you don’t actually agree with it. And William Buckley said he “stands athwart history, yelling stop.”6 I think we, with the show, stand athwart history and say: “That’s dumb. What a load of [expletive] that is.” Is that moral? I don’t know. I know that public lies that you are impelled to believe are worse than private ones. But I’m not Erin Brockovich.7 I’m sure as hell not Howard Beale.8 A fair amount of the time, I’m making poop jokes. Matter of fact, Jon Stewart, when it looked like “The Colbert Report” had come out of the box fully assembled and was going to happen, he said to me, “When your children go up to get their diplomas at whatever college they end up going to, I want you to whisper to yourself quietly as they get the sheepskin, ‘I paid for some of this with poop jokes.’”

Going back to “The Colbert Report” — Everything I did working up to Jon Stewart, I purposely didn’t do anything topical. “Strangers With Candy,”9 we didn’t live in the real world. In some ways, surreal comedy is enjoyable because it relieves you of any moral component. Really stupid, silly, absurd comedy is a wonderful retreat. I used to do this game when I was younger where I would hold up a piece of broccoli. I would look at the piece of broccoli until I could forget which way it was going to drop when I let it go. I would literally hold a piece of broccoli and say: “Forget which way is down. Forget your gravitocentric world, and just let go of that broccoli.” And I knew it had worked if I let it go and the broccoli dropped toward the table and I laughed, like, “I didn’t see that coming!” I used to do the same thing where I would go into a bathroom at work, and I would lock the door. Then I would try to forget whether or not I had locked the door. If someone came and jiggled the door handle and I was startled, I would know I had forgotten. That was a way to unknow the world, so I could see it differently and maybe write more absurd jokes.

When you were doing “The Colbert Report,” there was a huge amount of projection happening on the part of the audience about who you really were and what you really thought.10 Since you’ve switched to “The Late Show” and stopped playing a character, what’s been the most interesting or weirdest idea you’ve noticed people projecting onto you? That I want to be a political force. That’s the weirdest thing. I said to Jon, back in the day: “You and I are like Frodo and Samwise. We’re trying to throw the damn ring in the volcano. It doesn’t occur to them that we don’t want to use it.” Our way of throwing the ring in the volcano is to make fun of political behavior. But people got mad at me. “Oh, now he’s fashioning himself as a player.” And I’m like, you could not be more wrong. If you think I want that, you know nothing about me. I just want to make jokes. I care about what happens in the news. I have an audience that seems to care, too. We mesh on the jokes. It’s not complicated.

How many times have you read “The Lord of the Rings?” I lost count at 50. I am in the middle of a 180-hour lecture series by Corey Olsen, the Tolkien professor, who goes through it page by page. Almost every night I listen to about 15 minutes of a lecture.

What is it about those books for you? There are very few fictional works with that depth and background. Those first stories — Eärendil the Mariner — those attempts to create a national epic like the Finns have the Kalevala;11 England did not have that, so that’s Tolkien’s magnum opus, and he was still working on that in 1973 when he died. This attempt that he had to create a gesamtkunstwerk. It’s a complete work. A total work of art.

But what do you get from “The Lord of the Rings” emotionally? Loss.

What about loss? Tolkien makes loss beautiful. He has a medievalist view of the world: The world is in a constant state of diminishment. The elves originally create the rings to stop the diminishment of the world, to maintain the beauty of the moment of creation that they came into. And the great revelation, which comes from Tolkien’s elves, is that men are incredibly ambitious and build high towers because they know they’re going to be gone. The elves are laid-back because they’re going to be around forever, and so they don’t have great ambition. Their great continuing sadness is that they see the diminishment of the world. That sadness is, I think, a big part of Catholicism. Because God himself dies, and God himself has agony and, of course, original sin.

Did the books help you make sense of your own loss? Sure, of course. Nobody gets out unscathed. Frodo, he’s the hero, but he has to go to Valinor to be healed of his wounds, and Gandalf says, I will not say: do not cry, for not all tears are an evil. And Galadriel, when she doesn’t take the ring — what’s beautiful about that is that she says: “I pass the test. I will diminish and go into the West and remain Galadriel.” The heroic thing to do is to accept your diminishment, to accept — in the human’s case — death. In Tolkien’s world, death is the gift of Ilúvatar, who’s the one God. Catholicism is deeply combed through all these things. To perceive the world in the light of eternity, to accept your death as a gift, to accept suffering as a path toward joy. All of those are in Christ on the cross. So I think the books are another way for me to perceive the reality that my faith is trying to reveal to me through its tradition.

I want to ask you what’s probably a naïve question about faith. But I promise that it’s sincere, and it’s about something I’m hoping you can help me with. I know that faith is a subject that often gets raised in interviews with you. It does get raised a lot, because it first got raised, and then it self-perpetuates. I guess not a lot of people in my business are comfortable talking about it. But it means a lot to me, and it was a big part of my identity growing up.

You’ve said something to the effect that “The Late Show” can help to remind people that there is rational, objective reality and that a politician can’t just say “this is what’s real” and expect to have people believe it. I don’t know whether I have ever said that.12 You’re phrasing that in an interesting way that has a different meaning than I intended, but finish your question, and I’ll see where you’re going with that.

Thank you. So this is related to the idea of how belief in nationalism is ultimately about the feeling and comfort that idea gives people and maybe not so much about objective facts, which is to say it’s about a kind of faith. But, and I think this is part of what I’ve always stumbled over with religion, why is it that we might accept a form of belief that perhaps doesn’t jibe with objective reality as being fundamentally problematic and socially detrimental while another one — religious belief — we’re supposed to understand as O.K.? Can parallels be drawn there? That’s interesting. That’s a really big question. I think you’re describing two different things. Everyone approaches their own faith in their own way. So you might be describing an exact parallel between someone’s faith and our present political moment. There might be no difference to some people. To me, there’s a difference because in the red meat that gets thrown out in many political rallies, not just this president’s, you’re indulging the audience’s appetite. That’s not the same thing as appealing to their principles. To indulge the audience’s appetite is what my old character on “The Colbert Report” used to do. That was indulging a white, Christian, straight male American hegemonic self-image, and that’s not the same thing as faith. Faith is an acceptance of reality for me, and it is an attempt to humbly perceive what your role is, and my faith, as anemic as it is, reminds me of values of fellowship, love, humility. Those are all things that I might have in common with people at anyone’s red-meat-slinging rally, but when the meat is offered at those rallies, maybe the principles aren’t as important as the meat. Faith is different. Faith is not trying to change the world. Faith is not trying to change God. Faith isn’t trying to change the order of things. Faith isn’t trying to maintain your position. Faith isn’t trying to make less of the other. Faith is asking God to change you. You are the subject of God’s love, and in accepting that, you can transform yourself and release yourself of these appetites that are almost always at someone else’s expense. That’s how they’re different to me. But you asked because you were wondering whether I could give that to you? Because I can’t.

No, no. I just thought you would help me by having a thoughtful answer to my confused question. Which you did. I’m O.K. talking about my faith, but I work very hard not to proselytize. I would never want anybody to think I was trying to convince them of my point of view. Because, hey, more Jesus for me.

The other day your monologue was about the de facto Alabama abortion ban. Yeah, I had avoided making jokes about it, because you can’t win making jokes about abortion. Half of the people are just going to be mad at you. But Alabama was an unavoidable one. The reason we did it was because that was about, I thought, a very cynical, purposeful overreach. Even the people who were writing the law said they don’t want that law.

Because it’s about getting the law kicked up to the Supreme Court? Right. But I don’t understand why the governor would sign that law. That seemed like a real misuse of legislation. Write the law you want, and then see whether the Supreme Court supports you. Don’t write the law you don’t want just so it will go to the Supreme Court. The whole thing seems so contemptible to me. But that had such a larger political perspective to it that it seemed as though not talking about it would have been an odd breaking of my own rule: We talk about what people are talking about.

Your monologue did make me wonder where you stand on the legal right to an abortion. I doubt I’ll ever need to get one.

Well, can I ask, then, if you support a woman’s legal right to an abortion? I support a woman’s legal right to exert all her rights. One of her rights, presently, is to have an abortion. I am not in favor of the judges who have been appointed who might likely overturn that. I respect the women I know and their opinion on the subject. I believe that abortion is a woman’s choice. I also know and love many people who feel differently.

Thank you for addressing that. I know it’s a complicated subject. It’s not really a difficult subject for me in terms of its political reality. It’s a difficult subject for me because of its comedy. It is a march through a desert comedically, and I do not mistake myself for a political figure. I’m a comedian, and so my reticence has nothing to do with my politics.

So to return to the idea that people incorrectly might think that you want to be a political player. Which is understandable, because a reality star is president.

Do you consider the balance of whom you’re making jokes about? Sure. That’s going to be helped now because there are Democrats to talk about. When Joe Biden got heat for sniffing women’s heads, we did an act that he was doing A.S.M.R. We make jokes about Beto O’Rourke. We make jokes about Elizabeth Warren. We make jokes about Andrew Yang. We make jokes about Pete Buttigieg. What I’m happy about is that my audience is laughing at all of them, which is good. But not everybody is as mockable as everybody else, and some mockability doesn’t have consequences. Now, maybe Andrew Yang will be president — I don’t know [expletive] about politics; I only know about human behavior — but his running on no circumcision, free money and legalized pot13 is of no consequence compared with Donald Trump. So in terms of balance, I don’t really care. I care about being honest about what people talked about today.

In what ways do you know about human behavior? I was trained as an actor, and there’s a philosophical introspective aspect of acting. Because of that training, I approach political satire not through politics but: Why is that person behaving that way? What are the insecurities inside the president? Why does he need to lie? That’s not about politics. I deconstruct human behavior and think,What’s funny about that?

Can you apply that same actorly psychological analysis to yourself? What’s funny about your own behavior? If I’m enjoying a meeting I’m having with someone, I interrupt them constantly. If I’m bored by the meeting, I look like I’m very attentive. I am late for everything. I can relate anything you say back to something from the legendarium of J.R.R. Tolkien or his letters, to a fault. I can usually summon up a little bit of poetry that has something to do with what we’ve just talked about. All of these show that my mind is something of a squirrel cage. I scramble all over the place. Having a conversation with me is like having a conversation with three different people at the same time. Oh, I also cry easily.

As far as the larger conversation we’re all having, do you think there’s a way in which, intentionally or not, your show functions as part of the political punditsphere we seem to be mired in, where it feels as if we’re all mad at one another all the time? You’re describing a divisive atmosphere, and when you say “function,” I think you mean, “Does it feed that?”

Yes. It might. The behavior I’m exhibiting fits my genre, which is not supposed to have respectability. There’s a reason it’s not a central part of polite society. But there’s supposed to be a polite society out there! It’s not my fault there isn’t one anymore. I feel completely secure encouraging laughter at the behavior of people who I think are doing a terrible job and claiming that they’re doing it all for our benefit or being mendacious. So am I part of the problem? That is not for me to say. I just think I’m doing my job.

This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity from two conversations.
