THE word ''environmentalist'' does not roll easily out of Roger Ullman's mouth. He enunciates each syllable. It is a pleasant if unfamiliar way to define himself. When he says it, even for the second or third time, he sounds a little like a young contestant in a spelling bee.

''I am still trying to get used to it,'' he acknowledges.

Mr. Ullman, 42, with a degree from the Harvard Business School and a career spent in international investment banking, including many years as a banker in the developing world, left his job as a managing director of investment banking at Merrill Lynch last year.

He began work, at a much reduced salary, for the recently created New York chapter of Environmental Entrepreneurs, also known as E2, a small nationwide environmental group made up of about 400 business executives. The group, begun about three years ago in Silicon Valley by Bob Epstein, who co-founded the database company Sybase Inc. and two other start-ups, is part of a growing movement by executives who combine a love of finance and business with environmental concerns. And, with skills and connections that many environmentalists may lack, they are producing results.

''My credo is that economic progress and environmental progress are desirable, possible and not mutually exclusive,'' he said.
