''In the past,'' Mr. McVeigh wrote, ''you would see the news and see a bank robbery, and judge him a 'criminal.' But, without getting too lengthy, the Federal Reserve and the banks are the real criminals, so where is the crime in getting even? I guess if I reflect, it's sort of a Robin Hood thing, and our government is the evil king.''

Miss McVeigh later told the F.B.I. that her brother once told her he planned a bank robbery with others who carried it out and showed her the large stack of $100 bills he said was his share. She said he had given her three of the bills and asked her to give him $300 in smaller denominations.

Four months before the bombing, Mr. McVeigh, who was moving from place to place around the country while keeping a mail drop in Kingman, Ariz., wrote his sister in a letter mailed from Caro, Mich:

''Of course you must realize, then, that I'm not living in Arizona. You know how hard it is to get into that deep of a lie with Dad? It's painful, especially how you have to look so confident when telling stories (lies).''

''Why am I running?'' he added. ''I am trying to keep my path 'cool,' so in case someone is looking to 'shut up someone who knows too much' I will not be easy to find. I have also been working, and establishing a 'network' of friends so that if someone does start looking for me, I will know ahead of time and be warned.''

''If that 'tip' ever comes, (I have 'ears' all over the country) that's when I disappear, or go completely underground. Believe me, if that necessity ever comes to pass, it will be very difficult for anyone to find me.''

In the greatest stroke of luck in the Federal investigation, Mr. McVeigh was arrested shortly after the bombing by an Oklahoma highway patrolman who noticed that his car had no license plate.

An extensive investigation failed to establish any operational links between Mr. McVeigh and other anti-Government groups. But documents from the investigation show that several witnesses supplied tantalizing details to support such a possibility.
