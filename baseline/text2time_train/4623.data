Two fire trucks on the way to the same fire on the Lower East Side of Manhattan collided yesterday afternoon, injuring 11 firefighters and two bystanders, a spokesman for the Fire Department said. All of the injured were taken to hospitals, and all, except for one firefighter, who is being held for observation at Bellevue Hospital, were released. A Bellevue spokesman would not specify the fireman's injuries last night but said his condition was stable.

The accident took place about 2:30 P.M., the Fire Department spokesman said, when two trucks responding to a fire at 387 Grand Street collided at the intersection of Grand and Essex streets. Both trucks were from the same firehouse, but only one was traveling to the fire from the firehouse, said the spokesman, who would not give his name or identify the fire company.
