Here’s a last visit with Pete Seeger , starting with a beautiful, if grainy, video vignette from the Beacon Sloop Club Corn Festival in August, 2012 , as he led a chorus of “ So Long it’s Been Good to Know You ,” a Woody Guthrie tune that was a staple of the Weavers:

As I mentioned early in the week, I had the opportunity to sing for him on Monday with other friends and family gathered in the hospital in his final hours. The song I chose was one I wrote recently about the stretch of the Hudson River Valley that Pete had called home from 1949 until his passing and that I moved to in 1991. It’s a particularly special spot where the river takes tight, deep turns as it cuts through an ancient mountain range worn into bluff hills.

I was deeply moved when I played the fresh recording of the song for Pete last September at his home and he began to sing along, unbidden: “From Breakneck Ridge to the Bear Mountain Bridge, and all that lies between…”

I’ve created a fresh video version of the song that begins with a snippet of video from that moment. Pete was always a generous listener and adviser when it came to lyrics and melodies. This is one last public “thank you” to a master of song, and life:

Here are the hyper-linked lyrics, which I posted here a year ago along with an early version of the recording:
