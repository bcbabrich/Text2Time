Sanyo Electric Inc. and its southern California sales representative, CMA Sales Inc., have agreed to pay $109,437 in penalties and court costs to settle an antitrust suit that charged the two companies with price fixing.

The suit, filed Monday in San Diego Superior Court by the San Diego district attorney's office and settled on the same day, contended that Sanyo and CMA Sales had threatened to cut off Sanyo products to southern California retailers who sold Sanyo car stereo products for less than a company-set minimum price.

Gerald Libby, attorney for Sanyo, refused to comment on any aspect of the case. Neither Sanyo or CMA Sales admitted any guilt or liability.
