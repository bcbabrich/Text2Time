Pilkington P.L.C. said yesterday that its first-half profit rose 35 percent, and it announced a rights offer intended to raise L303 million ($475 million) to finance acquisitions and investment. Pilkington, the world's largest supplier of automotive glass, said its profit in the six months that ended on Sept. 30 rose to L104 million ($163 million), from L77 million a year ago, aided by a 3 percent net increase in prices. The figure from the 1994 period includes a one-time gain of L16 million.

The company said shareholders could buy one new share for every four they own, at a price of 155 pence ($2.43) each. The company said the rights issue was necessary to continue to expand while reducing debt. (Bloomberg Business News)
