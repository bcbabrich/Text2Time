"You ought to be able to separate violent kids from the nonviolent kids," Mr. Cuomo said last week in an interview with reporters and editors of The New York Times. "You ought to establish schools where you can put the kids who carry guns and otherwise upset things." Attendance should be mandatory, he said.

Mr. Cortines declined to comment on the safety plan yesterday. A draft version of the plan was provided to The New York Times by someone who helped write it.

The plan had immediate critics. "The board's whole history in providing things like this is they don't turn out the way they are described," said Joan Harrington, associate director of Advocates for Children, a private group that represents students in suspension hearings. "They end up poorly staffed and poorly run. This is going to be just another place to warehouse youngsters."

The plan outlining the new schools, which are termed "mandated instructional programs," goes to considerable lengths to describe them as more than mere holding pens. The schools would provide "a highly structured alternative setting for youngsters who have been expelled from their home schools," offer a full curriculum and feature computer labs as well as programs offering credit for community service, the plan says.

The schools, which would be mandatory for any student caught at school with a gun or illegal knife or who "uses any weapon in an aggressive act," would focus on "self-esteem building, long- and short-range goal setting, establishing a locus of control, dealing with bureaucracies, and improving peer and authority relationships," the plan says.

The plan urges Mr. Giuliani to use funds from the Federal crime bill to establish one academy for intermediate and another for high school students in each of the four large boroughs and one in Staten Island. It estimates that an academy with 150 places would cost $1.6 million to build and $650,000 a year to run, and it requests City Hall's help in identifying suitable sites.

The nine schools would have a capacity of 1,350 students. During the 1992-93 school year, the last for which figures were immediately available, 1,632 students were suspended for weapons possession; in 121 cases the weapon was a gun.
