Over the course of two acts and 2 hours and 25 minutes, under the gummy direction of Steven Carl McCasland (who also plays Howie), these characters scramble around the stage, trading clunky wisecracks until, one by one, they bite the dust. Needless to say, none meets his or her demise too soon, or in a manner that is either thrilling or entertaining.

Taking my cue from Mr. Rich, who forbore to mention the names of the unfortunate actors in his review, I will do the same, except to note that at least the Snooks of Brittany Velotta has a certain ghastly verve, as does the crazed tapping of Caroline Rosenblum as Gay.

To have witnessed the unbelievable antics of these characters from a seat in the Eugene O’Neill Theater, a venerable Broadway house, must have been a truly surreal experience. Watching the same ludicrous proceedings as they unfold on the scuffed stage of the Connelly Theater in the East Village, on a flimsy set that would seem skimpy even for a middle school production of “The Man Who Came to Dinner,” does not feel like an epochal experience. It’s barely an endurable one.

True, it is perhaps easier now to guffaw heartily at exclamations like “I don’t know about the rest of you, but I could sure use a drink,” or “Does this madness never end?” But come to think of it, I can’t really recall if that last was a line from the play or an outburst that inadvertently escaped from my lips. In this case, Siri remained silent.
