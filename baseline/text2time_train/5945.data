Women's sports keep growing in partipication and prestige. Two measures of that progress will be evident here Monday night at the third Women's Sports Foundation annual awards dinner.

First, 77 world-class female athletes will be guests, and second, many male sports celebrities will be there to honor them.

Herb Brooks, the Rangers' coach, is one of the men who will present awards. ''I'm going to be there because I think women in athletics is a very healthy thing for our society,'' said Brooks, whose hockey season opens two days later. ''The spinoff is that our whole society will become more conscious of physical fitness, and go from a society of spectators to a society of participants.''

Rafer Johnson, the 1960 Olympic decathalon champion, will present the Professional Sportswoman of the Year award. Steve Scott, the American mile record-holder, will present the award for the Amateur Sportswoman of the Year.
