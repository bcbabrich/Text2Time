A dozen Yankees surrounded a small television in a corner of the visitor's clubhouse at Anaheim Stadium this afternoon, watching the Baltimore Orioles play the Seattle Mariners. They shouted encouragement like typical fans, criticized players and plays like typical fans and, unlike typical Yankees fans, actually seemed relaxed.

Five hours later the Yankees were even more relaxed, because Jimmy Key rebounded from being smashed in the left elbow with a line drive five days ago to twirl eight tidy innings, Charlie Hayes made a smashing season debut with two hits and three runs batted in and every starter rapped at least one hit as New York coasted to a 14-3 victory over the California Angels.

Will the real Yankees please stand up?

For the first time on this West Coast road trip, the Yankees looked intimidating. They did it by scoring seven runs in the third inning off Jason Dickson, a 23-year-old rookie who beat them on Aug. 20, and never stopping. The struggling Cecil Fielder rested and New York did not hit a homer, but baseballs soared into orbit all night anyway: The Yankees roped eight singles, seven doubles and a triple.

Key (10-10), who won for the first time in five starts, permitted only home runs by George Arias and Chili Davis to sail into orbit as he also looked intimidating in his artistic way. The Yankees were worried when Seattle's Alex Rodriguez drilled a liner off Key's elbow last Monday and he was forced to leave that game in the first, but he eased those concerns in limiting California to five hits. Key was not fazed by the liner as he speared six grounders tonight. Dale Polley loaded the bases in the ninth, but got Orlando Palmeiro to pop up to close out the victory.
