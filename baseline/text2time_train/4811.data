To the Editor:

Your coverage of the Persian Gulf war welcome-home celebrations in New York City and Washington highlights the incongruent priorities in Federal and local policies.

The Washington celebration focused on hardware (news story June 9). It cost $12 million (including an unforeseen $4 million cost overrun), and the Pentagon picked up a $7 million bill. Only about 200,000 people showed up. The veterans and their families were treated to corporate donations of hot dogs, and the crowds enjoyed an expensive hardware fest.

In New York, we celebrated the people who served in the war. For hours on June 10 more than two million New Yorkers watched people, not hardware, march up Broadway. Most of the $5 million bill was paid by private donations. New Yorkers could visit a few ships docked in the area, and sailors enjoyed the city.

Washington has monuments, but New York also has an ordinary course of daily existence that never fails to impress visitors. Even after active duty, they haven't seen it all. I watched some very alert sailors offer their subway seats to two women. The look on one woman's face reflected the contagious pride from being hosts to these guests.
