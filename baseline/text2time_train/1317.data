ATHENS — Outside of the N.B.A., the Euroleague is the best basketball in the world. For Ricky Rubio to lead a team of F.C. Barcelona’s caliber, at age 20, is a tremendous accomplishment. But he may have learned all he can by playing professionally in Spain, and if basketball is his first priority, it’s time to come to the N.B.A.

That is not to say that Rubio, who was selected fifth in the 2009

draft by the Timberwolves, has not improved in Spain. The professional polish shows in his game. He has acquired a skill set that would be hard to develop in the A.A.U.-dominated American development system. He’s a pass-first guy. He’s polished coming off the pick and roll. His awareness of help defense and defensive schemes is extremely advanced.

All of these skills were on display when F.C. Barcelona, last season’s champion, was eliminated from the Euroleague playoffs, with a 78-67 loss against Panathinaikos B.C. on Thursday. In smoky and packed Olympic Stadium, Rubio was asked to fill a variety of roles. He chased the former University of Maryland star Drew Nicholas around screens as if he were Reggie Miller. He denied the Panathinaikos linchpin Dimitris Diamantidis and often kept him from even catching the ball. On offense he initiated Barcelona’s sets, made quick outlets, and fed the post smoothly and seemingly without effort.



None of this is to say that Rubio had a good basketball game. In 29 minutes, he shot 1-of-5 from the field, with 3 points, 3 assists and 3 turnovers. He found himself on the bench for most of the last three minutes.

Worse than a poor individual performance, Rubio appears to have settled into a role that emphasizes his weaknesses. He was doing everything his coaches were asking of him; they just weren’t asking very much. The role of a point guard for Barcelona is to initiate the offense and run the pick and roll. Gone was the open court vision for which Rubio is known. Barcelona rarely looked to push the ball, and when it did, Panathinaikos simply took a non-shooting foul to slow down the pace.

Make no mistake about it, Rubio has trouble scoring. He can’t shoot and he doesn’t even look to score around the basket. But he’s a tremendously gifted passer. That was evident even with the shackles Barcelona had on him. His skip passes against Panathinaikos’ pack-the-paint defense were quick and in the shooter’s pocket. He knew when he wanted to get the ball into the post and where his teammates liked to catch it. He got the ball out and up the court easily, blessed with that gift of just knowing where his teammates are, rather than having to look for them.

In the Euroleague, playing at a snails pace and surrounded by average athleticism, Rubio’s inability to score is more important than his ability to set up his teammates. It’s why Barcelona had him sitting at the conclusion of its season-ending loss. He’s an offensive liability. Worse still, he does not even have to make plays. He can just initiate the offense in the half-court, often never to see the ball again in a possession. He can’t learn that way.

It’s easy to see how his game would be different in the N.B.A. If the ball was in his hands on the fast break, or longer in the half court, he would have to finish plays, not initiate them. At first this might mean assists to gifted teammates, but teams would adjust and it would ultimately require learning how to score. He is not getting that opportunity to develop within the Barcelona’s system.

For those looking for an American comparison, it’s best to forget Pete Maravich or Steve Nash. Rubio will never be a legendary scorer like Maravich, or a drop-dead shooter like Nash. The better comparison is Celtics guard Rajon Rondo. Like Rondo, Rubio is at his best in the open floor, when his lack of shooting does not clutter the floor. They both excel when surrounded by scorers. Both have a talent for getting rebounds and steals, and neither needs to score to be effective. Rubio is not blessed with the quickness of Rondo, but his court sense and anticipation on the defensive end have made him a top-notch defender in Europe.

The strongest part of this comparison is how much better suited Rondo was for the N.B.A. than for college basketball. Like Rondo after his freshman year at Kentucky, Rubio is seeing his stock drop because he is playing in a system that does not exploit his gifts. He will thrive in the more wide-open N.B.A. game, where there are not always three defenders sitting in the paint. Like Rondo at Kentucky, Rubio has learned all he can from a cluttered style of basketball and is being held back by it. Some players are just meant to play with the best players in the best league in the world. Rubio is one of them.
