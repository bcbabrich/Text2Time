One chamber of Wisconsin's Legislature approved a bill early today requiring minors to get parental consent before having abortions and defeated an effort to repeal a law that penalizes doctors who perform abortions.

''This is going to be a shot heard around the world,'' said State Representative Robert Welch, a Republican. ''Wisconsin is a liberal state taking a moderate stand on abortion.''

The State Assembly, the Legislature's lower house, had sifted through 30 proposed amendments before its 72-to-24 vote early today for a bill that would require girls under the age of 18 to have the consent of at least one parent or a court. Consent would not be required in cases involving victims of incest or rape. The measure now goes to the Senate.

'Pro-Life Isn't Dead'

''We're elated,'' said Barbara Lyons, executive director of the Wisconsin Right to Life organization. ''I think it deflates all the rhetoric that the pro-choice movement was sweeping the country. Pro-life isn't dead; it's alive.''
