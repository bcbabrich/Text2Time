James B. Skidmore, the former Mayor of the Village of East Hampton, L. I., died Saturday after a long illness at his home at 35 Dunemere Lane in East Hampton. He was 77 years old.

He served for many years as vice president of Pattison and Bowns, a wholesale coal company in New York City and later founded his own company, the Skidmore Coal Company of New York City and East Hampton. He retired in 1967 when he became Mayor.

Mr. Skidmore was a member of the United States Marine Corps during World War I. He was a past commander of the Brooklyn Power Squadron and a former secretary of the Maidstone Club in East Hampton.
