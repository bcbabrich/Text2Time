I welcome your comments on my Sunday column, which defends the Catholic Church in ways that won’t make the Vatican happy. It’s a follow-up to a column of a couple of weeks ago talking about the two churches that leave me somewhat dizzied and bewildered, the old-boys club at the Vatican and the heroic one at the grassroots.

Some readers objected that it’s all one church, good and bad, and that the grassroots church is possible only because of support from the top. But the nuns and priests who are out in the field doing heroic work actually get remarkably little support from the Vatican or from church collections, and the divergence is immense. To me at least, and I can’t claim to be a close observer, so much of the Vatican is about protocol and bureaucratic self-defense and ritual, while so many of the folks in the field just care about serving others. Father Michael may have been the worst-dressed priest I’ve ever seen – and the noblest.

Critics of the church object for a different reason. As they see it, there may be some selfless nuns and priests out there, but at the end of the day they represent an institution that sanctifies male supremacy and that opposes condoms to fight AIDS. To me, that doesn’t quite seem right. Many nuns and priests in Latin America and Africa don’t really represent Vatican policy on, say, condoms but subvert it. Sometimes nuns and priests hand out condoms to keep parishioners alive. The Catholic Church truly is catholic, with a small c, in the sense of being broad and varied.

In any case, please post your comments on the column. And, whatever your position, thanks for being respectful of other commenters.
