Barry Bonnell ran for Burroughs, maneuver made by Tom Burgess, the acting manager, to give the Braves more speed. Bobby Cox had been dismissed for some abusive words from the bench while the Mets were batting in the fifth. Nick Colosi, the plate umpire, tossed Cox out.

With Bonnell on first, Lockwood committed a balk, the fourth one called by the second‐base umpire, Joe West. With Bonnell on second, Biff Pocoroba sliced a double to right for the run. Lockwood got out of the inning without further scoring.

Although the Mets had 11 hits off four pitchers, they left 13 men on base. The Braves made better use of their scoring opportunities, leaving only six men stranded on the same number of hits.

“We had a bunch of chances,” was all Manager Joe Torre could say after the game.

The Braves had protested vigorously when Joel Youngblood threw out Burroughs at first for the second out in the fourth. Actually, Youngblood's throw pulled Willie Montanez off ‘first base—or so it seemed to the 5,399 fans, who booed Satch Davidson”s call. It was Cox's jawing that finally got under Colosi's skin, so he gave the Atlanta manager the restof the night off.

The balk calls led to Met runs in the first against Preston Hanna, Atlanta's starting pitcher, and in the sixth against Adrian Devine, the third Braves pitcher. Devine balked Boisclair to second, wild pitched Boiselair to third, and then balked him home with New York'Is final run. Montanez, on base with an intentional walk, moved to second on the same balk.
