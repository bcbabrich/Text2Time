Investment Cut Seen

“How anyone can look at 314 as a desirable solution is beyond me,” says Bruce Lippke, economist for the Weyerhaeuser Corporation, the Northwest's giant forest products company. “Yet it's the first chance people have had to kick back. They're fed up with no help for the schools from the legislature and this is one way to vent their anger.

“We are against it. But the initiative will probably pass because people are mad—and uninformed about the real consequences.”

Then he adds: “Our investments could be reduced as much as 20 per cent, depending on our cash flow.”

Foes of the measure also say that the tax is “regressive” because corporations who do in ‐ state business, such as grocery and retail stores, will increase their prices and, in effect, consumers will pay the tax. They also contend that the tax will not cure the school ills, as the measure will raise only half of current school requests and will not totally replace future school levies.

Also receiving attention is the impact the tax would have on the flow of out‐of‐state investment funds; Initiative 314 applies a compensating tax to earnings of out‐of‐state corporations investing in Washington. Mortgage officials estimate that 50 to 70 per cent of funds for its industry come from out of state, mainly the East, and they say the tax could shut off that money.

Gov. Daniel Evans has been quoted as having said the initiative contains a bombshell that has been little noticed—its effect on municipal‐bond interest rates. Such bonds are taxexempt under the Federal regulations, but Initiative 314 would tax such interest.

On a $100‐million bond issue, the interest rate might be about 6 per cent. But under 314, one bond expert said any corporate buyers of the bonds would be required to pay the 12 per cent tax on the interest. Thus, they would demand higher interest rate to purchase them, perhaps 6.8 per cent. Taxpayers would pick up the extra cost, which could run into millions.

Backers of 314, however, say that many such bonds are held by individuals and thus Would! not be subject to the tax.
