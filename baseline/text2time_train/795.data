KERNER--Oliver JB, a renowned Chicago psychologist, died peacefully at his home on April 16 at the age of 96. His life was guided by two abiding passions: his loving devotion to his wife, Jane, of 56 years with whom the honeymoon never ended; and his consuming dedication to the teaching and training of psychoanalytic therapy for clinical psychologists. At the city, state, and national level, no single person did more to advance the cause of professional psychologists in achieving legal parity with psychiatrists, eligibility for insurance reimbursement, access to psychoanalytic training, and professional legitimacy in the eyes of the American public. In so doing, he was instrumental in widening the availability of psychotherapeutic services for everyone. Generous, witty, and wise, he leaves behind an indelible legacy of leadership and service to the profession in which he remained active to the very end.
