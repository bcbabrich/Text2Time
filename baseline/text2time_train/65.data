I nominate Kate Moore, the protagonist of Chris Pavone’s sizzling thriller THE PARIS DIVERSION (Crown, $27), for patron saint of working wives and mothers everywhere. Kate is the on-call parent of two rambunctious young boys, Ben and Jake, the problem-solving wife of a high-risk husband, Dexter, and the boss of the Paris substation of a clandestine American spy operation. On top of all that, she’s expected to be the perfect expat mom, a cut above those other expat wives with their “aggressive parenting, fanatical nesting, competitive entertaining.” It’s almost a relief when a suicide bomber strapped with explosives turns up at the Place Vendôme and gives Kate an excuse to get out of the house and back into the game.

Pavone strikes a somber note here, observing that Paris hasn’t been the same since the carnage at Charlie Hebdo in 2015. “There’s a general foreboding in the air,” he explains. “There is no such thing as safety for anyone, anywhere. Not anymore.” For Kate, the new sign of the times is the sight of armored personnel carriers rolling down the Champs-Élysées.

The novel’s carefully layered plot takes readers from the offices of a multinational company, where a master of industry is planning a dicey corporate merger, to a filthy alley where one hired killer confronts another. But at the heart of the story is the domestic drama playing out between Kate and Dexter. Distracted by worries about losing her job, Kate fails to notice her husband’s increasingly reckless activities in the stock market. For his part, Dexter has been lying to Kate about how deeply he’s gone into the market and where his investment money came from. Both characters are so realistically drawn that their quarrels sound unscripted. But Pavone takes great pains with all his characters, from the stuffed-shirt C.E.O. who’s so full of himself that he doesn’t realize he’s been kidnapped to the unhappy suicide bomber who volunteered for a mission but didn’t understand it would involve blowing himself up.

Isaiah Coleridge, an intimidating presence in Laird Barron’s BLACK MOUNTAIN (Putnam, $26), used to be a hit man for the mob. (“Got dirty laundry? Call in Isaiah Coleridge. He gets the tough stains out.”) Just don’t inquire about the number of assassinations he notched up in his killing days. (“Asking a professional how many people he’s dusted is discourteous.”) Nowadays, Coleridge still works for the mob, but as a fully licensed private eye operating out of a pretty hamlet in the Hudson Valley.
