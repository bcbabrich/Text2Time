Embraer of Brazil, a leading maker of regional jets, intends to raise $307.5 million in a public share offering in Brazil and on the New York Stock Exchange. The company will sell up to 52.8 million new nonvoting preferred shares to finance a new factory and research complex in Sao Paulo. Three Embraer shareholders -- Simonsen Financial Holdings Ltd., the Bank of Brazil's pension fund, Previ, and the Brazilian National Development Bank -- will sell an additional 31.2 million preferred shares. Embraer is one of Brazil's most successful companies and demand for its regional jets has been growing in recent years. Jennifer L. Rich
