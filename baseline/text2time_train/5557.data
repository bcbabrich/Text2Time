Leo Perlis, for 25 years director of community services for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., died of a stroke Sunday at the Miami Heart Institute in Miami Beach. He was 74 years old and lived in Bay Harbor Islands, Fla.

From 1945 to 1955, Mr. Perlis was director of community services for the Congress of Industrial Organizations. When it merged with the American Federation of Labor, he remained as director until 1980, when he retired, becoming a consultant. He moved to Florida two years later.

In retirement, Mr. Perlis continued to speak out for workers, as well as to the leadership of the labor movement. In 1984, in an Op-Ed page article in The New York Times, he said that endorsement of Presidential candidates in advance of primary elections would not bring the ''new era'' labor sought. ''It will begin,'' he wrote, ''only when labor realizes that demonstrations and pre-primary endorsements are poor substitutes for organizing the unorganized, educating the organized, developing a participatory rather than an adversary approach to business, and greater involvement in community affairs.'' He Worked in Silk Mills

Mr. Perlis was born in Russia and came to the United States in 1923, at the age of 11. He graduated from East Side High School in Paterson, N.J., and began his career as a newspaper editor on The Call in Paterson. He became a worker in the silk mills of Paterson and a member of the silk workers' union, a predecessor of the Textile Workers. In 1936, he became active in Labor's Nonpartisan League, a union political action group headed by John L. Lewis.
