At "The Phantom of the Opera," the Telecharge salesperson flatly said that on Saturdays "nothing is available in the center orchestra for the entire run of the show" -- despite the fact that the run is unlimited. But not even "Blood Brothers," an unprofitable production on its last legs, could fill the order. No wonder tourists turn to scalpers, or give up on Broadway altogether.

Mr. Koppell's job is to find out where all those tickets go, and how they get there. Few in the theater doubt that ice plays a major role. Ice is the industry's term -- derived from an old machine politicians' acronym for Incidental Campaign Expenses -- for bribes paid by scalpers for prime tickets at the box office. Since Broadway box offices -- and their phone extensions, like Telecharge -- are run by the theaters' owners, not the individual shows that are tenants, many producers are rooting for the Attorney General to help them at last gain control of their own ticket inventory. "Shows are hosts surrounded by parasites," says a producer; he believes one theater employee collected up to $15,000 tax-free a week in ice at one of his hits.

Meanwhile, fear reigns. Shortly after Mr. Koppell's investigation first leaked out in The New York Observer, the Shubert Organization, Broadway's largest theater owner, fired the manager and box-office staff of its Philadelphia touring outpost, the Forrest, but refuses to explain why to reporters. No producer I contacted would speak about ice for attribution; one refused to talk on the phone and instructed me to meet him instead in an anonymous midtown office.

This is a crucial moment for Broadway. The pre-Tony Awards boom is on. After an abominable winter, the street's marquees are alight again with big names -- Stephen Sondheim, Arthur Miller, Tommy Tune, Disney. But how many plays will survive Labor Day? For the first extended period in memory, not a single Broadway show, the big musicals included, is a consistent sellout.

Smart theater people know that high ticket prices compounded by scalping are driving away business when Broadway needs every customer it can get. Smart politicians know that ticket scandals are political windfalls: Louis Lefkowitz, the Attorney General who uncovered $10 million in Broadway ice in 1963, was on the front page for months. Smart New Yorkers know that Broadway's health is essential to the city's economy. With passions like these at play, who doubts that Mr. Koppell has the makings of a smash hit?
