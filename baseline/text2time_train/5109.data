Cut out patches with shears, snips or a sharp utility knife. A patch should be as long as the crack and at least an inch wide. Fasten it with pipe-joint cement (PVC cement), which is used to join plastic plumbing and is sold at hardware stores.

First use PVC cleaner-primer, sold with the cement, to clean the patch and the area around the crack on the back of the siding. Put cement on the patch and the siding, and press the patch into place, covering the crack. Hold the pieces together for about 30 seconds, until the cement hardens.

To reinstall siding, reverse the removal procedure. First press the lower edge of the removed section against the upper edge of the section below, locking them together. Then lift the lower edge of the section above and nail the removed piece to the wall. Use broad-headed roofing-siding nails, either aluminum or galvanized steel, like the ones that were removed. The nails must be long enough to pass through any exterior insulation and penetrate three-quarters of an inch into wooden sheathing or wall framing.

Put the nails as close as possible to the center of the prepunched nailing slots, but not in the original holes. Install the nails 16 to 18 inches apart. Drive them straight in - not at an angle - and leave an eighth of an inch gap between the siding and the nailheads. After nailing, the siding should slide back and forth freely.

Use the zip tool to lock the upper edge of the reinstalled siding to the lower edge of the section above it. To do this, pull a portion of the upper siding downward with the tool, over the lip of the reinstalled siding. Holding the tool in place, press the pieces together with the heel of your other hand. Continue sliding the zip tool along the edge, pressing with the heel of your hand as you go, to snap the entire seam together.

It is also possible, but more difficult, to replace damaged vinyl corner posts. These posts have a vertical nailer strip on each side, and the replacement involves removing the damaged post from its nailer strips, which will remain attached to the building. Then the nailer strips are removed from a new corner post, which is attached to the old strips.

To remove the damaged post, use a sharp utility knife to score both sides of the post vertically, just beneath the edges that overlap the siding. Be sure the flanges that join the old post to its nailing strips remain as wide as possible. Use pliers to grasp the portion of the post that overlaps the siding, and bend it back and forth until the post breaks on the scored lines.
