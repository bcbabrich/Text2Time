The Arkansas law firm in which Hillary Rodham Clinton and several senior Administration officials were partners violated conflict-of-interest rules in representing a savings association at the center of the Whitewater investigation, Federal regulators said today.

In a summary report prepared by the Inspector General of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, investigators said the firm, the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock, had failed to disclose a conflict involving Webster L. Hubbell's representation of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association after it was seized by the Government.

Mr. Hubbell was a Rose partner until he left to become the Associate Attorney General in 1993. The report by the F.D.I.C. found that while Mr. Hubbell represented the regulators, he had failed to disclose that he had also been involved in a lawsuit brought against Madison by Seth Ward, his father-in-law. Mr. Ward's company, POM Inc., had borrowed significant amounts from Madison.

The report also found $156,286 in questionable billings by the Rose Firm.

A different Government audit by the Resolution Trust Corporation covering a period that overlaps with that in today's report has questioned about $446,000 in billings by the firm.
