J. Robert Moore, a geologist and oceanographer who was an expert on marine mining, died last Saturday at his home in Austin, Tex. He was 69.

The cause was complications from colon cancer, said his wife, Dorothy Taylor Moore.

In an academic career of nearly 30 years, Dr. Moore directed university research institutes in Wisconsin, Alaska and Texas before retiring last year as professor of marine science at the University of Texas in Austin.

A graduate of the University of Houston in 1951, he earned a master's degree in geology from Harvard University in 1954. Before receiving his Ph.D. in geology and oceanography from the University of Wales in 1964, he worked for Texaco in the United States as a senior scientist. While studying at Wales, he was the chief geologist of a British program to explore for manganese nodules and other minerals in the Irish Sea.

In 1966 he became a professor of geology at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, where he founded and directed the Marine Research Laboratory and the Underwater Minerals Program. While at Wisconsin, he also founded the Underwater Mining Institute, which publishes The Journal of Marine Mining. He was the institute's chairman and the journal's editor in chief until 1994.
