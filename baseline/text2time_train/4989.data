Three Million Mailings

Roger Craver, a direct-mail consultant with half a dozen clients who have questioned the Souter nomination, said he had already sent out three million mailings to alert people about a possible fight over abortion. He said he was preparing a second series of mailings aimed at the Judiciary Committee and the Senate ''to impress upon the Senate that they must ask this question'' about the judge's stand on abortion.

One letter sent by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund sought an ''emergency contribution,'' with this statement: ''You can count on my help in launching the Fund for Justice to make certain that Judge Souter will be the kind of Supreme Court Justice who recognizes and protects our right to privacy and reproductive rights.''

Another, an ''express wire'' from the National Organization for Women, declared: ''Judge Souter must be subjected to the same level of scrutiny to which Robert Bork was subjected in 1987. We expect no less this time from the Senate Judiciary Committee.''

'Collecting Data' on Souter

Groups that oppose abortion have not been as quick to produce mailings, even though organizations on both sides of the issue found that the longer the debate simmered the more money they collected when Judge Robert H. Bork's nomination was before the Senate in 1987.

The direct-mail company of Richard A. Delgaudio, which produced solicitations in the Bork battle, has not yet used Judge Souter for fund raising. ''Organizations don't know as much about Souter,'' said George Lodick, a company official. ''They're in the process of collecting data. So we haven't decided anything.''
