The adaptability of opera to the exigencies of televi sion has long since been demonstrated, and although we do not see many operas on the TV screen nowadays it is not because the art form and the medium are incom patible.

(The opera was pre sented in other parts of the country over the N.E.T. net work last night.)

“Peter Grimes,” which is now 25 years old, is prob ably the best‐know and best liked mid‐20th‐century op era. Its style is rooted in the past, but its psychological overtones and moderately modern musical idiom give it a continuing contemporary flavor. Based on a poem by George Crabbe, the libretto by Montagu Slater recounts the tragedy of a lonely, am bitious fisherman.

This performance was taped at Aldeburgh Festival Hall in England in February, 1969. The composer conduct ed, and Joan Cross was the stage director. Instead of using the multiple‐studio technique developed years ago to achieve maximum word clarity and judicious balances between singers and instruments, over‐all miking was used. And medi um and long‐shot photogra phy to emphasize environ ment was favored over close‐ups that stress char acter impact.
