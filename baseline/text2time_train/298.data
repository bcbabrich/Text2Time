GLENDALE, Ariz. — Clelin Ferrell, a redshirt freshman defensive end, described standing on the University of Phoenix Stadium sideline in his Clemson jersey as “a big moment.”

“It was like, ‘Wow!’” he said.

Ferrell was not talking about Saturday night at the stadium, where he was named the defensive most valuable player for his performance in Clemson’s 31-0 thrashing of Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl, a College Football Playoff semifinal.

Ferrell redshirted a year ago, but he said he dressed anyway and warmed up with his teammates before the Tigers lost here to Alabama, 45-40, in last season’s national championship game.

“I tried to get as close to the action as I could,” he said.

In his playoff debut on Saturday, Ferrell never seemed far from the football. The Ohio State offense had no way to protect against the mayhem he created. Ferrell was a 6-foot-5, 265-pound wrecking ball, finishing with four tackles, including one of the Tigers’ three sacks of Ohio State quarterback J. T. Barrett, in the first shutout of any college team coached by Urban Meyer.
