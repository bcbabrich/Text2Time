Later this week, a who’s who of the mergers and acquisitions world will troop down to New Orleans, where Tulane University Law School will be holding its Corporate Law Institute. The event, which formally starts Thursday, will mark the 20th anniversary of an annual gathering that regularly draws the nation’s most prominent deal lawyers.

Flipping through the brochure, one is struck by just how much things have changed in the few short months since it was first distributed. But the events of the last year still loom large. Below, 10 of the burning issues that I hope will be discussed later this week.

1. Is it time to retire the Williams Act? The Williams Act is 40 years old this year, and many of its provisions governing tender offers are outdated, set up for a time before the poison pill, when companies lacked takeover defenses. For example, given the existence of a poison pill and a target’s ability to cap a bidder’s acquisitions of shares, is it even necessary to retain the all-holders/best price rule?

2. Conversely, when will the Securities and Exchange Commission get back in the takeover regulation business? The S.E.C. has been a relatively quiescent regulator of takeovers since its heyday in the 1980s, apparently content to let Delaware be the king. The last real, substantive S.E.C. review of merger regulation was back in 1983. (Marty Lipton was on that panel also.) This has left us with a federal takeover code that is outdated — see point 1 — and sometimes makes little sense. For example, is there any reason to not put mergers and tender offers on full parity? And why is it that the Delaware courts now appear to be the primary regulators of fairness opinion disclosure? It would be nice if the S.E.C. could at least fix these issues and harmonize its regulation with the last twenty years of Delaware’s decisions.

3. Are special-purpose acquisition companies a boon — or the next calamity waiting to happen? In particular — and since this is a takeover conference — I’m interested in the issues that are likely to arise in the coming wave of SPAC takeovers. Will significant SPAC shareholders attempt to hold up acquisitions and extort additional consideration by their ability to vote no on acquisitions and force a liquidation of the vehicle? What happens when the trading price of a SPAC is actually below the liquidation value in such circumstances? And who is still buying these things anyway?

4.What is the likely future structure of private equity transactions? Are we going to see a continued, wholesale shift to single-tier reverse termination fee deals with no possibility of specific performance? This appears to be the trend right now, but what will happen once the market perks up again and strategic bidders compete for deals? In this regard, it would be nice to get some comment from the Delaware judges on what they think about the availability of specific performance in a cash deal under Delaware law in the face of party language to that effect.

5. When will the S.E.C. finally reform its cross-border rules? Eight years after their promulgation, the S.E.C. exemptions for cross-border transactions are still unworkable.

6. What should we do about sovereign wealth funds? This was the hot-button issue three issues back, before Bear Stearns; the Clear Channel litigation and its implications for bank-sponsor lending relationships; and the possible restructuring of the financial regulatory framework. But the question remains: Is more regulation of sovereign wealth funds a necessity or an economic burden? And does Treasury’s recent one-page voluntary statement of principles with Dubai and Singapore on these funds mean anything at all? The background issue here is whether the national security review process is currently effective and not overburdensome in light of, inter alia, CFIUS’s blocking of the 3Com transaction. Or perhaps it is not strict enough and should apply to noncontrolling transactions, such as the recent slew of investment bank sovereign wealth investments.

7. Are hedge funds the future of mergers? As hedge funds become increasingly activist investors, how will they affect the structuring and completion of takeovers? Are the cries of short-termism correct — or even relevant?

8. Do we need to rethink the terms of debt financing arrangements? Given the blow-up in the Clear Channel litigation, should sponsors and other borrowers firm up terms in financing commitment letters and fill the uncertainty over what the “customary” language requirement means? Is Clear Channel an abnormality or is there indeed a need for a rethink of financing language? And how about that solvency language which bit Genesco so hard?

9. Is the Bear Stearns deal valid under Delaware law? Will it spell the end of the holding in Omnicare? Her,e I include that uncapped top-up option that went by the wayside in the renegotiated deal. And where is Joe Lewis these days, anyway?

10. Who do you love more: the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the S.E.C.? In other words, discuss the Paulson proposal and its chances for success.

I’ll also be there at Tulane. I’m hoping to find answers to these and other takeover questions. If you do happen to be attending, feel free to say hi. I’ll be the guy selling do-it-yourself SPAC kits. –Steven M. Davidoff
