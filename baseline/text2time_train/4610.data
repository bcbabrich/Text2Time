"Slow Art: Painting in New York Now" is a big, easygoing show that looks pretty good on first encounter but gets worse the more you think about it. Ambitious in size, it fills nearly 20 big galleries at the P.S. 1 Museum in Long Island City, Queens, with canvases by more than 100 New York City artists, which makes it the biggest contemporary painting show here in many years. It is also exceedingly well timed, coming at the end of a season in which the so-called "return" of painting has been a hot topic and the subject of several gallery shows and panel discussions.

The title suggests that painting is a slow, contemplative tradition, and that the show will provide an antidote to those supposedly speedier art forms -- sculpture, photography and Conceptualism -- which have dominated the New York scene for the past few seasons. It has been organized by Alanna Heiss, the founding director of P.S. 1, and the painters she has chosen span several generations, numerous styles and nearly every degree of reputation, from world-famous artists like Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein to virtual unknowns, both old and young.

But while "Slow Art" reaches suggestively in several directions at once, encompassing both geometric and Expressionistic forms of abstraction, both realistic and folk-artsy figuration, it never assumes an intelligible shape. It omits some of painting's most prominent practitioners -- David Salle and Robert Ryman, for example -- while ignoring some of the medium's more striking recent developments on both the abstract and feminist fronts. In any number of ways, it fails to live up to its emphatic, definitive-sounding subtitle, "Painting in New York Now," blowing a golden opportunity to assess the medium's current condition.

Ms. Heiss lets herself off the hook early. In marked contrast to the subtitle, a blurb on the checklist describes the exhibition as a " 'working' show rather than a comprehensive survey," that is, a "subjective -- even visceral -- curatorial selection." It is as if the curator is saying that the show is incomplete and that her organizing principles and standards of judgment cannot be explained. It also suggests a sense of capriciousness that is borne out by the show itself.
