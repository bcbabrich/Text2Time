Governor Carey said yesterday that rents in rent‐controlled or stabilized apartments should be related to the tenants' ability to pay “so that those who need rent control will have it, and those who don't need it and can afford higher rents will pay them.”

The proposal could mean higher costs for thousands of tenants in New York City and other parts of the state.

He announced that he was forming a “task force” to develop a “needs‐based. rent‐control system” as part of efforts to change the present rent laws. Any such system would have to be approved by the Legislature before it could be adopted.

The Governor's statements, made during and after a meeting of corporate executives and members of the Regional Plan Association, immediately drew fire from a major tenants' group, but were applauded in varying degrees by real‐estate spokesmen.
