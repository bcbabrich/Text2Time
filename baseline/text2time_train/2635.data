Re "First Night, Single Theme for Double Term: Sept. 11" (news analysis, Aug. 31):

As an American, I felt a great sadness as I watched the first night of the Republican National Convention. It is a shame that the Republicans are using 9/11, an event that blurred political lines, to divide the two parties further than ever.

Sept. 11 is something that we all remember, understand and live with every day. We all saw those buildings fall and were all affected in some way.

To claim that day as one's own because it suits a political platform is tasteless and offensive.
