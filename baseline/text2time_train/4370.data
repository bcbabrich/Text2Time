Right after hearing on Wednesday morning that a ferry had gone down en route from Tallinn, Estonia, to Stockholm, Majlis Alm rushed down to the senior citizen's center here, fearing the worst.

Mrs. Alm, a town council member who had previously run programs for elderly residents, knew that a group of local retirees were on a ferry trip to Tallinn. When it became clear that it was their vessel that had capsized and sunk, she summoned up the will to look at the list of their names. Six of the first eight names she saw were friends. Of the 56 people on the list -- all still missing and presumed dead -- she knew 20 well.

"I was reading the list and just crying," she said. "It was hard to be of much help to others."

In a country that has been knocked off its bearings by the loss of the ferry Estonia and more than 800 of its passengers, most of them Swedes, no town has taken a harder blow than Norrkoping, a placid port city of 120,000 people 100 miles south of Stockholm.

The 56 travelers from Norrkoping, including 14 married couples, were nearly all grandmothers and grandfathers, longtime residents with relatives and friends all over town. Bengt Malmstrom was known to all as the former chairman of the local health authority. Arne Engberg had long organized a popular bicycle race.
