FROM the mid-1970's to the mid-80's, museum exhibitions of corporate art collections were nearly commonplace. But they are rare today, and it is not because business has lost interest in the subject.

Far from it. In the last decade, the number of companies acquiring art has gone from 300 to about 1,200, according to the Directory of Corporate Art Collections.

Still, it seems that more corporations are keeping their art at home for the edification of their employees and for visiting clients. Whatever the reasons -- and no doubt the growing cost of insurance is one of them -- they have not deterred the 13 companies represented in "Corporations Collect I" at the Morris Museum.

The most venerable lender is the chemicals manufacturer Ciba-Geigy, which began acquiring in 1959 and now owns about 600 works. Initiated 10 years later, the holdings of the Prudential Insurance Company now total more than 11,000 items; the Chemical Bank has gathered 2,000 pieces gathered over the same period. And, in 20 years, A.T.& T. has amassed 3,500 works. As collectors, the remaining corporations are Johnny-come-latelies, but Schering-Plough and Nabisco maintain galleries that display New Jersey artists.
