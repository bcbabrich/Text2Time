IT'S not surprising that "Riding the Bus With My Sister," the 2003 autobiographical book by Rachel Simon that inspired tonight's Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation, is set in a city that is never named. If word got out about the town's terrific bus drivers, the regulars would be standing in the aisles. And Ms. Simon's sister, Beth, the most fanatic of regulars, would be among them. In her book, Ms. Simon describes Beth (near right, with Ms. Simon) as "a person with mental retardation." She now prefers "with a developmental or cognitive disability," she said, although Beth likes "a person with special needs" -- one of them being the freedom to bus-hop around her city for most of the day. Like the book, the film, shown at 9 on CBS, is about the year Ms. Simon decided to enter her sister's world on wheels, but includes flashbacks to their childhood. During her time en route, Ms. Simon discovered the kindness of strangers (there are 12 bus drivers in her book, reduced to two composites in the movie), as well as the special abilities of the sister she had worried too much about for 38 years. "I've inadvertently become a national speaker for both the disability community and the public transit industry, and I meet bus drivers all around the country," she said. "They're a type of person that is well represented by the people in the movie -- very giving people, sensitive people, people people." It was at the house of one of Beth's bus-driving buddies that Ms. Simon and her sister first watched the film, which stars Andie MacDowell as a dewy-eyed Rachel and Rosie O'Donnell as a bouncy, beat-you-to-the-bus-door Beth. "What Rosie got," Ms. Simon said, "was exactly what she wanted to get: a character who is being portrayed not as a stereotype but as a full person -- someone who isn't going to be pushed around." Not even to the film's Los Angeles premiere. "Oh, yeah, she knows what she wants," Ms. Simon said of the real Beth. "She doesn't want to be on an airplane. And what's the fun of sitting in a movie theater with movie stars if you can sit on a bus with your favorite driver?" JODY ALESANDRO
