THE British cultural invasion, ominously advancinghere on several fronts, has firmly established a beachhead in art. Last week a big “Contemporary British Painting and Sculpture” exhibit settled in at Buffalo's Albright‐Knox Art Gallery. Next February a “Recent British Art” show will appear at Minneapolis's Walker Art Center, then travel to museums around the country. What's more, three poppish young British painters, some of whose work appears in the shows, have turned up for a stay among us. They are Gerald Laing, 28, an ex‐British Army man who paints racing cars and bathing beauties; Allen Jones, 27, a top prizewinner at last year's Paris Biennale, and Peter Phillips, 25, who created some far‐out constructions for England's recent Shakespeare Exhibition.

'We're here because the excitement is here,” mused Laing the other day at the Richard Feigen Gallery on East 81st Street, where he's just had a. one ‐ man show. “Americans have a force and vitality that enables them to do wild things. We're more cynical at home. It's all right, but it's not an atmosphere that lets things grow.”

Laing came to New York with his wife last summer, liked it so much that Mrs. Laing has just gone home to fetch the baby. Phillips came, with h is wife, on a 21‐month Harkness Foundation grant. And Jones (now showing at Feigen), a classmate of Phillips at London's Royal College of Art, arrived here last Easter; was joined by Mrs. Jones last week.

All three want to look around the country. Phillips, whose Harkness grant specifies three months of travel, says he'll head for Las Vegas “and hit as many states as wecan.” Jones would like “to get some sun.” Laing is attracted by California — “my subject matter's there. Dragsters, surfing, all that sort of thing. But right now I'm readinging ‘Main Street’ to bone up on the Middle West.
