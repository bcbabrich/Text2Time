YANCEY--Mary Anne. It is with great sadness that the Brooklyn Youth Chorus Academy bids farewell to Mary Anne Yancey, one of our staunchest advocates and greatest benefactors. Mary Anne was intelligent, kind, formidable, and fiercely dedicated to her adopted borough of Brooklyn. She had many gifts which she shared generously with her friends and colleagues. Since 2002, Mary Anne has been a Trustee of the Brooklyn Youth Chorus Academy, and served as an articulate and inspiring leader for the board, staff, and students. During her three years as Chair, she presided over an extraordinary period of advancement, both academically and artistically. Under her leadership BYCA doubled the number of children served, tripled the amount of financial aid offered to families in need, embarked on our most adventurous artistic projects, attracted a new generation of supporters, and created a dynamic and challenging blueprint to lead our organization to its 25th anniversary. Mary Anne was very proud of BYCA's feature performances with renowned artists such as the New York Philharmonic, Elton John, Barbra Streisand, Harolyn Blackwell and Kronos Quartet, and delighted in bringing her friends and family to see BYCA's young singers on prestigious stages such as Radio City Music Hall, Carnegie Hall and the Brooklyn Academy of Music. She was extremely proud of BYCA's impressive record of commissioning new works from celebrated composers such as Nico Muhly and Pulitzer Prize winners Caroline Shaw, David Lang and Paul Morevec. Mary Anne's commitment to her family and community will never be forgotten, and we will honor her legacy by continuing her efforts, carrying forth her incredible dedication to the Brooklyn Youth Chorus Academy and the borough that she loved.
