BURSTING a speculative bubble is easy for a central banker. Doing so without killing a lot of innocent bystanders is not. Alan Greenspan may have accomplished the task.

The operative phrase is "a lot," and there are many people who would disagree with it. Certainly there were many speculators who suffered greatly as a result of the Federal Reserve's tightening of credit, including some who did not know they were speculating. But the Fed managed to unwind huge speculation on interest rates with only minimal damage to the stock market and the economy.

The bubble was, to be sure, in large part a creation of Mr. Greenspan. When the American banking system was reeling from the effect of bad loans in 1990, the Fed and its chairman helped to engineer a prolonged period of falling interest rates and -- perhaps more importantly -- a very steep yield curve. With short rates much lower than long rates, banks could pay less for deposits and make a nice profit buying government bonds.

As time went on, more and more people began to play that game, and to convince themselves they were geniuses because the money rolled in. The derivatives market made it easier to make those bets, and easier to conceal from the unsophisticated just what was being done. Getting out of the way when Mr. Greenspan changed the rules in February required nimble footwork that few could manage, and 1994 produced a line of humiliated speculators including Piper Jaffray's Worth Bruntjen and Orange County's Robert Citron.
