CHICAGO, Dec. 31—Despite vigorous protests by defense at torneys, Abbie Hoffman was questioned closely today about his alleged plan to “kidnap” a high‐ranking Chicago police of ficial.

Mr. Hoffman, who has been on the witness stand at the Chicago conspiracy trial all week, at first refused to discuss the subject, citing the Fifth Amendment privilege against self‐incrimination.

When Judge Julius J. Hoff man ordered him to answer questions, the Yippie leader complied, but he denied most of the charges implicit in the ques tions asked by Richard Schultz, an Assistant United States At torney.

The dispute developed late in the afternoon when Mr. Schultz asked Mr. Hoffman whether he had been in Chicago on Aug. 29, 1968, the day after the Demo cratic National Convention here ended.
