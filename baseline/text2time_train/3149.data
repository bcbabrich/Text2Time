New details of the stripped-down budget that leaders in the State Legislature intend to pass later this week began to emerge today, and it was not a pretty picture for most state agencies and nonprofit organizations dependent on state help.

The spartan budget would, for instance, eliminate a $150 million fund for buying new parkland, cut about $58 million in block grants to communities and make it impossible for the New York State Urban Development Corporation to underwrite more than $100 million in capital projects. Governor George E. Pataki has control over how these funds are used.

The budget would also cut the parks and recreation department's budget by about $26 million, with much of that reduction coming from grants to museums. The parks budget eliminates, for instance, a $13 million grant to the American Museum of Natural History and a $1 million grant for the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

The budget would also keep in place a $113 million reduction in Medicaid financing that the governor proposed in January, though lawmakers do not intend to adopt an accompanying bill that would change reimbursements from Medicaid for nursing homes. As a result the program is likely to run short of money before the end of the year.
