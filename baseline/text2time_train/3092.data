On the simplest level, the show works as a raucous parody that sends up the hokey conventions of the sitcom genre. This fictional George (played by the unexpectedly funny Timothy Bottoms) is a bumbling father like Homer Simpson, or Hal on ''Malcolm in the Middle.'' Homer works at a nuclear power plant, and George holds the power to start a nuclear strike, but both would have trouble feeding themselves without help from their smarter wives. George is the president as doofus Dad. And who, after all, is more of a national Daddy figure than a president?

But after the informal, scandal-ridden Clinton years, what could seem more retro and hollow than putting the first family on a pedestal? ''That's My Bush!'' is a satire of hero worship itself; it is the anti-''West Wing'' and the first true post-Clinton comedy.

Its creators have gone out of their way to say the show is not political, but they're the ''South Park'' guys; we're not supposed to take what they say literally. It is true, however, that the series is not ideological. The concept, in place long before the election, was to spoof the first family whether that meant going after Bushes or Gores. The show's production and its original debut date of Feb. 28 were delayed because of the post-election tussle.

But the series is not divorced from politics. George tackles issues like abortion and gun control, treating them as superficially as the typical sitcom or 60-second campaign ad does. What, the series make you wonder, is the big difference between these approaches?

This politically astute criticism is embedded in so much hysterical humor that the series never seems weighty. References to classic sitcoms are everywhere, beginning with the mock opening credits that introduce the characters, some more linked to reality than others. Besides George and Laura there is the fictional Maggie, a smart-mouthed maid who looks like the heroine of the 60's comedy ''Hazel'' and is played by Marcia Wallace from ''The Bob Newhart Show.'' There is a next-door neighbor who keeps barging into the house for no reason; he is named Larry (John D'Aquino), like the neighbor in the second ''Newhart'' series. (''Hi, I'm Larry, this is my brother Darryl, this is my other brother Darryl.'') And there is Karl Rove (Kurt Fuller), a balding right-hand man who keeps the Oval Office from chaos and, of course, has the same name as the real president's adviser and campaign mastermind.
