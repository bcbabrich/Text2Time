A 97-acre parcel of prime riverfront land vacant since an automotive factory closed seven years ago would be transformed into a waterfront promenade with a 150-room hotel, 1,562 housing units, a handful of small shops and tree-lined public walkways leading to the heart of Sleepy Hollow under development plans outlined this week.

The project's developers, the Roseland Property Company of Short Hills, N.J., presented their plans to village officials and residents at Sleepy Hollow High School tonight. The residential component of the plan includes 200 housing units for the elderly and 21 moderately priced town houses, and the developers expect the project to have 185,000 square feet of retail space and 95,000 square feet of office space. They would not give an estimate of the project's cost.

The project, named Lighthouse Landing, is to rise just north of the Tappan Zee Bridge on the largest developable tract of land on the Hudson River in Westchester, property that has been in limbo since the auto assembly plant, owned by General Motors, closed in 1996. Last year, the village, frustrated by the delay, began legal proceedings against G.M. to buy the property, but the parties settled the dispute in September after G.M. agreed to have final development plans approved by August 2005. If that deadline passes, Sleepy Hollow can exercise its option to buy the land.

Mayor Philip E. Zegarelli called the design, which covers 80 percent of the lot, ''a good jumping-off point to begin the approval process.'' The remaining 20 percent would be open space.
