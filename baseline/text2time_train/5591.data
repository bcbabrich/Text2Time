The Supreme Court today barred Oakland, Calif., from claiming ownership of the Raiders of the National Football League, who moved to Los Angeles in 1982.

The justices, without comment, let die Oakland's lawsuit that sought to force the team to return there.

In the appeal acted on today, Oakland officials contended that governmental ''eminent domain'' power, which allows state and local governments to take private property for public use after paying ''just compensation,'' applied to the football team.

A California appeals court last November rejected what it called the city's ''novel'' legal theory.
