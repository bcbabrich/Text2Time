A judge was suspended for three months without pay yesterday by the State Supreme Court after the court found that she had lied to the police about a hostile encounter with a sheriff's officer she had dated. The judge, Rosemarie R. Williams of State Superior Court in Mercer County, and Officer Alfred Wesley Bridges had broken off their relationship when in April 2000 he took another woman to a restaurant in Ewing where Judge Williams was having dinner, prompting a heated argument, the court said. She followed Officer Bridges and the woman to a bar in Trenton, where the hostilities resumed, the court said. But, the court said, after he asked the proprietor to call the police, the judge called the police to report that he had followed her. In her actions, the court ruled, Judge Williams ''demonstrated a lack of respect for the law that as a judge she has sworn to uphold.''
