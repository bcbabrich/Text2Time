Midway Airlines Inc., which last month introduced a policy of fully refundable excursion fares, said it was doubling, to 48 hours, the period in which passengers must buy their excursion tickets after making reservations. The extension takes effect immediately. A spokesman for the Chicago-based carrier said the longer deadline was for the convenience of customers and travel agents.
