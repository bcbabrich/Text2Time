Among other scenes he did not choose to recall aloud were those of Haitian refugees adrift at sea as their rulers spent months mocking American threats, and the violence that broke out in the streets of Port-au-Prince last fall even as American soldiers looked on.

Instead, Mr. Clinton sought to make indelible a vision of a United States putting its power to good service. From the steps of the gleaming National Palace and from the side of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who had sent Mr. Clinton and his predecessor into fits of exasperation over what they saw as his uncooperativeness in exile, the President declared that the American-led mission "has been accomplished and with remarkable success."

"Today we come together as friends," Mr. Clinton told the citizens of a country whose plight has for so long confounded American leaders.

Even last September, as he sent American soldiers back to Haiti for the first time since F.D.R., Mr. Clinton always described their objectives as limited. In a Haiti that is still desperately poor and much less than stable -- despite an operation that has cost $900 million since United States soldiers landed on Sept. 17, he was careful to repeat those cautious words today.

But with Republicans in Congress outspoken in their criticism of peacekeeping missions, and with public opinion polls showing tepid support for American involvement here, the President also transformed his appearance into a kind of emblem.

He recalled the doubts that were raised last summer as his showdown with Haiti's military leaders reached its crucial point, and he made clear that he had no doubt that he had chosen the proper course.

"Seven months ago, the world wondered whether the United States could summon the will to protect democracy in this hemisphere," Mr. Clinton told the soldiers this morning. "Now the world knows once again that the United States will honor its commitment and stand up for freedom."
