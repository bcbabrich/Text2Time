''The state statute says you can substitute a name on the ballot within 51 days of the election,'' Mr. Perr said. ''However the statute then stops, and doesn't say what happens if you are closer than 51 days. So what it will come down to is a battle over the common law and practices of the state.''

Mr. Perr said the courts were unlikely to insist on a blank space on a major party's ballot in a federal election. ''There is an overwhelming federal and state trend toward giving the voters as much choice as possible around election time,'' he said.

Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said today, ''The law in New Jersey is very clear: an individual may not pull his or her name from the ballot 51 days from the election.'' He said the committee would join ''in any challenge'' to the effort to replace Mr. Torricelli.

William Barrone, the lawyer for Douglas R. Forrester, the Republican nominee, whose campaign had repeatedly called for Mr. Torricelli to resign from the Senate, said today that the only exception to the 51-day rule the courts had allowed was in the case of a candidate who died after the deadline had passed.

''The Democrats will say, 'Well, Bob Torricelli dropped out, and now the voters have a right to choose,' '' Mr. Barrone said. ''Well, the voters have that right, but it's not like Bob Torricelli was hit by a bus -- he got hit by his own ethics.''

Mr. Barrone said the mechanics of printing and distributing ballots made the change with 36 days to go unreasonable and illegal.

''In this case, not only have the deadlines been blown by more than two weeks,'' he said, ''the ballots have been printed in all 21 counties, absentee ballots in some counties have been mailed, and far more importantly -- our overseas military voters have a federal right to vote by absentee, and their ballots were sent out last week.''
