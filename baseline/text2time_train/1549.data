Admit it: You’ve always wanted Carmen Electra to wish you a happy birthday. Or maybe not. But she is going to be at the ready just in case.

Beginning on Monday, a start-up called Cameo Stars will try to hop aboard the social media gravy train by selling video greetings from celebrities and athletes on Facebook . For $3, for instance, you can buy a video of Drew Brees , the New Orleans Saints quarterback, holding a piece of birthday cake. With a click you can post that video on a friend’s page.

“Hey, I heard it’s your birthday,” Mr. Brees says in the video. “I made this cake just for you. Have a great one.”

Stars get a royalty, and record videos for various occasions. (Certain videos will be free or priced at $1.)

Cameo Stars has had more luck signing up prominent athletes than A-list actors so far — Tony Romo and Reggie Bush have signed on — but Daren Hornig, the company’s chief executive, promises that more movie and television personalities are on the way.

“It’s a new way to build their brands and connect with fans,” Mr. Hornig said, adding that the offering will be introduced on iPhones and other social networks later. His ambitions are big: Cameo Stars thinks it can sell “a few million” of Mr. Romo’s videos alone.
