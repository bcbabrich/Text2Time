TARRYTOWN, N.Y.â€” If you have a child of a certain age say, old enough to need a dictionary but not old enough to go out and buy it herself -- the big news out of Ann Arbor, Mich., a few weeks ago was no news at all. According to a University of Michigan study, children have a lot less free time than they used to. You could have produced the same data from your kitchen table, where you preside over one of the chief culprits identified in the study: endless homework.

Gone are the early, easy years, when your child gathered autumn leaves for show and tell and still had time to work a jigsaw puzzle before bedtime. Gone, too, are the days of your youth, when homework was something children did by themselves, no questions asked. Your 9-year-old needs your help.

She must coax 20 spelling words per week into scintillating sentences. She has to master three-digit multiplication and long division, pronto. She's up until nearly 11 P.M. at least once a week, fashioning a wigwam out of an old leather slipper or searching for algae in filthy water scooped from a backyard puddle.

Any of these assignments alone might be manageable, but the message seems to be volume, volume, volume. Once you pile on music lessons, organized sports and household chores, you have the stressed-out specimen observed in the Michigan study.
