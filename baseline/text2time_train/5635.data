Daiwa Securities America, already well established in the Treasury bond market, yesterday made its debut as the lead underwriter in the domestic corporate market with a $125 million offering for the General Telephone Company of California.

The 8 1/8 percent bonds, which are rated Aa-3 by Moody's and AA- by S. & P., were offered at 98.959, to yield 8.28 percent to maturity in 1996.

They were awarded on a bid of 98.779 to produce a net interest cost to the borrower of 8.307 percent, compared with the next best bid of 8.375 percent.

''We want to increase our presence in the American market,'' noted Sinichi Tanaka, an executive vice president in charge of corporate finance at Daiwa. He said that Daiwa was acting as sole underwriter for the issue and that a ''substantial'' portion of it would be sold to Japanese investors.
