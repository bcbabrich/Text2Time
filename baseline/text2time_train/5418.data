FOR Horacio Gutierrez, a concert pianist is not unlike a tightrope walker: Juggling artistic needs with career goals can be a constant balancing act.

''You have to be very honest that what you are doing is indeed to enhance your artistic growth and not to fit in with the fads,'' said the 38-year-old pianist in an interview the other day. ''You want to do something that you really believe in, not just because it's popular, or because it's a sure-fire way to get an engagement.''

Not that getting engagements has been difficult for him. Since winning the silver medal at the 1970 Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow at age 21, Mr. Gutierrez has played and recorded with many of the world's major orchestras. In 1982 he was awarded the $10,000 Avery Fisher Prize, a noncompetitive honor given to young artists in recognition of their musical achievements.

On Sunday at 2 P.M., Mr. Gutierrez will play works by Mendelssohn, Schumann, Ravel and Liszt, in a solo recital at the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College, one block from the intersection of Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues. Tickets are $8 to $17; information: (718) 434-1900. 'Old Friends' and New Challenges
