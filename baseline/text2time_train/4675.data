The Administration plan consists of two main elements, one for retraining adult workers, at a cost of $2 billion a year, and the other for training for young people costing $1 billion.

For adults, the centerpiece of the strategy is what the Administration calls skill grants -- vouchers of up to $3,000 a year for two years for workers to refine job skills or learn new ones at colleges or trade schools.

Workers would also be eligible for counseling and job-search assistance. In addition, workers who had lost their jobs, had exhausted their unemployment insurance and were in retraining programs would be eligible for Federal assistance until until they found a job.

The skills grants would be available to workers who have lost their jobs or have been notified that their jobs are being eliminated and to workers in industries who fear job losses in the future.

The Administration estimates that 400,000 of 1.2 million workers affected each year by plant closings and large layoffs would use the vouchers, with about 150,000 of them needing Federal assistance while they complete their training. An additional 165,000 workers threatened by obsolete skills and technological shifts are expected to use skill grants for continuing education and training.

The new program would replace two major Labor Department programs dealing with laid-off workers, Trade Adjustment Assistance and Economic Dislocation and Work Adjustment Assistance.

Of the $2 billion the Administration would provide a year, two-thirds would be distributed to the states. Of the remaining $670 million, half would be used to ease the effects of the recently signed North American Free Trade Agreement and half would be spent on workers hurt by layoffs and plant closings in the military industry and in industries affected by the Clean Air Act, among other businesses.
