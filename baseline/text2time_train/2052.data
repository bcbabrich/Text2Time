I have a lot to say today.

The best of the “Unforgivable” videos are truly, deeply, scarily hilarious. And, yeah, they’re not safe for work at all. Watch “Unforgivable” No. 1 (search “unforgivable” on YouTube) twice, if you dare even to look at it, because the sham misogyny will clog your humor gears the first time — you won’t get it and you’ll say you’re stumped or offended.

“Unforgivable” is a giganto hit with the children of Facebook, the ones who watch “Family Guy” and miss Dave Chappelle every day. The four videos in this particular series have racked up more than a million views each on YouTube. It’s mind-blowing, the more you think about it. Comedy in the woods — black comedy in the woods — is snakes/planes perfect, sure. One look and you’re just into it. But there are also the lurching threats of this guy, and then his retreats into falsetto giggles, and his back-and-forth with the cameraman.

Steve Bryant, who introduced me to “Unforgivable,” deserves huge thanks. This is Steve Bryant, matinee idol, Talmudic master of YouTube, Zizek of The Daily Reel. (You are insane if you don’t look at The Daily Reel every day, by the way.)

Watch this “Unforgivable” guy try to affect his thug thing, and the instability of the gangsta pose, and the waffle fries, and the “You better not have no brothers.”



There’s an Eddie Murphy line that gets in my head these days and it’s not even a bit, it’s just a phrase, like a bridge that followed one of those awesome barks on “Comedian” and “Delirious.” It’s “I kid the homosexuals.”

The end of the joke is “… because they homosexuals,” which is all right, but if I remember the album — damn you, conscience, for not using Limewire — the audience cracks up at just the first part, “I kid the homosexuals.”

Eddie is coming down from some gay jokes, but he’s also setting up some more gay jokes — of the “gays are cool” kind — and he wants to excuse his lapse into obviousness and tautology (“I joke about X because X is X”) before offering some more nuanced take on his relation to gayness and femininity, which — as we all know — would get more “nuanced” with the introduction of a transvestite and his own subsequent career as a cross-dresser.

Anyway, I kid the … I kid the … Basically, like so many of us, I kid the networks. That’s all I wanted to say, in light of yesterday’s article in the newspaper about FunnyOrDie and SuperDeluxe, two Big Comedy efforts to ignore what’s already happening online, warm over “S.N.L.”-style outtakes and kitchen scraps from pilot season and try to use them — and household names — to bulldoze the comedy shacks and shanties that have been around for years.

Cool, OK. Monopoly! Comedopoly. Adam Smith, etc. But we can still complain when it’s not funny.

And we can still kid the “Saturday Night Live” veterans, the big straight-guy bullies of comedy, like Will Ferrell and Jimmy Fallon, because … they’re straight white guys. Who wouldn’t kid them, big guys all crammed into tiny screens? And now with the Sequoia Capital piling up, you have your Jimmy-come-lately Web sites with your focus-grouped names. FunnyOrDiiiiiiiiiie.

But so far every new network venture into Web land makes me want to live my life exclusively in Ebaumsworld. Where at least the crazy son-and-pop team of Rochester have been just doing their freakshow thing for a long, long time. And drawing massive international crowds.

So that was all a big wind-up way to say that AOL’s “This Just In” sends me a lot of video. And some of it is mediocre, some of it’s fine, some of it’s OK, some of it’s hard to even press play for.

But there’s this. Which I like. It’s among the best things they have. But compared to the omg awesomeness of “Unforgivable”? It’s nowhere.
