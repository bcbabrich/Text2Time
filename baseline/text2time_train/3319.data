Plans by AirbusIndustrie for a gigantic superjumbo jetliner, the Airbus A3XX, got a further lift after the Australian carrier Qantas became the sixth airline to express interest in buying the plane, which will transport at least 550 passengers. The others include Air France and the International Lease Finance Corporation. James Strong, chief executive of Qantas, said Qantas was interested in 10 of the jets, for delivery between 2006 and 2010. John Tagliabue
