Ah yes, we all remember. We remember everything. I do, and it is not because I'm especially sentimental. (The beige silk taffeta went to the Salvation Army a long time ago.) It is as if a hammer and chisel wielded by . . . the fates, maybe . . . had pounded the scene into my brain. Let me call it up, and I see the chilly December day, the gray-haired judge, the fireplace banked in red carnations, and my darker red shoes. Capezios. I see the groom, in dark blue, and his hands, which were sporting the first manicure he ever had. I had a manicure, too, my fourth and last. Three high school junior proms, one wedding: no gala since has matched those four. Ergo, no more manicures.

The champagne was in the bathtub, two dozen bottles or so heaped on big chunks of ice, and my roommate and I had iced the petits fours ourselves. My new sister-in-law had done the flowers, and an hour or two before the ceremony my mother had gone to Bergdorf's, the store nearest her hotel, to buy me a blue garter. My sister's bouquet - she was maid of honor - trembled in her hand, and the wedding cake was a disappointment. I had wanted a fruit cake; this was a white cake. Like I said, I - we - remember everything.

My younger daughter imagines her wedding - ''Long white dress, band and a professional makeup job,'' she snaps - and is much in demand as a bridesmaid. Her college classmates are getting married now, and I suppose she will be among them one of these days. Their weddings are elaborate and expensive and followed by sit-down dinners - none of this standing in a meadow and promising ''so long as we both shall dig it'' stuff. ''You'll get no such nonsense from me,'' I promise. ''Only watercress sandwiches and a harpist.'' I mean it, too.

But I'll buy her a blue garter anyway, and be wet-eyed when I see her in her dress (''off-the-shoulder, with a little waist,'' she tells me). After the guests are gone, I'll get into my old gray bathrobe and take out the old photograph albums and breathe a sigh of relief - that my child is settled down at last. Which is stupid of me because it is decades since marriage was equivalent to settling down at last and because it is a relationship about which I am, to say the least, ambivalent.

My ambivalence is less out of my own experience than out of what I perceive of others' experience. But I cannot quite trust these perceptions because no outsider can penetrate the wall that surrounds somebody else's marriage. Even so, too often I do not like what I see.
