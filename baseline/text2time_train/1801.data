DES MOINES — The Des Moines Register poll, which showed Senator Barack Obama pulling away from Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Senator John Edwards, had some interesting numbers below the top line. (To refresh your memory: Mr. Obama had 32 percent, Mrs. Clinton 25 percent and Mr. Edwards 24 percent.)

For one thing, it showed women supporting Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton equally. If this is the case, that’s obviously bad news for Mrs. Clinton, who has based her campaign on drawing a disproportionate share of women.

Both the Clinton and Edwards campaigns say the poll is flawed. It is out of line with other recent polls and the caucuses are notoriously difficult to forecast. But it showed 32 percent of women going to both Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton. Only 20 percent favor Mr. Edwards.



At the same time, men favor Mr. Obama and Mr. Edwards equally, at 31 percent and 30 percent respectively. The glaring deficit is men for Mrs. Clinton; only 16 percent support her.

Other polls have also shown that men are less comfortable with Mrs. Clinton than with her male rivals. That is all the more reason her campaign needs to shore up any lagging support among women.

But Ann Lewis, a senior adviser to Mrs. Clinton who oversees the women’s vote, says

Mrs. Clinton’s support among women continues to be strong and that because the poll oversampled independents, its results are “out of whack.”

“This poll has more to do with a change in sampling technique than any change of opinion among Democratic women,” she said. “We’ve had six or eight in the last three days and all of those except one had the race very close.”

The Register poll did fall in line with some broad trends that other surveys have indicated for some time:

By big margins, Mr. Obama draws young people (56 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds), those with college degrees (39 percent), those making more than $70,000 (37 percent), and those living in urban areas (37 percent).

Mrs. Clinton bests her two rivals only among those with no more than a high school diploma (32 percent) and those who identify themselves as Democrats (33 percent). She ties Mr. Edwards for support among people 55 or older (30 percent) and essentially ties Mr. Obama among those who make less than $50,000 (28 percent, with Mr. Obama at 27 percent).

An MSNBC poll of Iowa caucus-goers, conducted Dec. 26-28, for example, had Mrs. Clinton ahead among women, with 28 percent for her, 21 percent for Mr. Obama and 20 percent for Mr. Edwards.
