Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the Egyptian cleric charged in an assassination conspiracy and bomb plot that targeted major New York City sites, told a Federal judge yesterday that either the Government should bring his wife and family to the United States from Egypt or he should be allowed to "marry over here too."

"It is important that my wife and family should visit me at the expense of the American Government," Mr. Abdel Rahman said.

The joking remark about remarrying caused laughter in the courtroom. The judge, Michael B. Mukasey, did not rule on the sheik's request.

Mr. Abdel Rahman, 55, had two wives but divorced one of them several years ago. Under Islamic law, he is permitted up to four wives.
