Sept. 30th was International Podcast Day.

As with many holidays, unofficial and not — National Siblings Day, National Hot Dog Day, National Ferris Wheel Day — it was engineered to promote a cause.

International Podcast Day was created by Steve Lee, the founder of a podcasting network called the Modern Life Network. But this year Mr. Lee’s holiday came amid renewed interest in podcasts that had everything to do with one particular show.

“Serial,” last year’s hit show, told the story of a crime committed in Baltimore in 1999. It quickly became the most popular podcast in the history of the form. It has been downloaded more than 90 million times, and has incited plenty of talk about the medium’s bright future.

Entire podcasting networks, with multiple series to their name, have entered the field since the end of “Serial,” including Panoply, a group of shows produced by the parent company of the website Slate, and Gimlet Media, which has produced such hit series as “StartUp” and “Reply All.”
