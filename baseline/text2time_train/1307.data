NEW ORLEANS — If you were expecting fireworks on Friday about the Delaware Supreme Court’s decision in the Airgas case at the Tulane Corporate Law Institute, you were sorely disappointed.

It as not because there was a lack of tinder. Gary Bornstein, the lawyer for Cravath, Swaine & Moore who argued the case before the Delaware Supreme Court, was on the Tulane panel on Delaware developments, as was Justice Jack B. Jacobs, a very well-respected judge on that court.

And when the discussion began about the Airgas case, you could see them holding back smiles. If you remember, in that case the Delaware Supreme Court overturned Chancellor William B. Chandler III’s lower court opinion approving a shareholder bylaw that moved up the Airgas annual meeting to January 2011 from the fall.

If Chancellor Chandler’s decision had been upheld, as Mr. Bornstein had urged the court, it would have likely spelled doom for Airgas, as a majority of Airgas’s shareholders appeared eager to arrange a sale of the company to Air Products and Chemicals. At a January meeting, the shareholders would have likely replaced three more directors on the Airgas board and elected a majority of directors who probably would have voted to accept the hostile Air Products offer.

The Supreme Court instead held that the bylaw was invalid since it conflicted with Delaware law endorsing the staggered board. In my year-end column on the case, I gave the opinion an F. At the time, I wrote, “The opinion ignored prior law on the issue, and instead appeared to be a political statement by the judges, who endorsed the board’s central role over shareholders in resisting hostile takeovers.”

In fairness, there appears to be a split among lawyers who follow these things. The corporate lawyers, those who negotiate deals, tend to agree with me that not only was there a loophole in the bylaws, but that Delaware law was clear on the subject.

Conversely, the litigators more familiar with the Delaware courts disagree with my opinion and think the decision was not a surprise and a natural extension of the Supreme Court’s protection of directors and the staggered board.

This all makes grist for a great discussion about Delaware policies on takeovers, staggered boards, statutory interpretation and the appropriateness of judicial policy-making.

Instead, the panel noted the decision and discussed its ramifications. Namely, how far a board could move up or back its meeting date. The parties thought a month or two was fine, but not much more was discussed.

In part, the lack of discussion was a result of the preference of Justice Jacobs not to discuss the factors leading to court decisions or provide a back story. Here, he is very different than Vice Chancellor Leo E. Strine Jr. of Delaware Chancery Court, who often is quite eager to discuss his opinions and disagreements with other case decisions. It is a matter of judicial style.

The panel included Jaculin Aaron from Shearman & Sterling, Bruce Silverstein from Young Conaway Stargatt & Taylor, and Frederick Alexander from Morris, Nichols, Arsht & Tunnell. These are all accomplished lawyers, but they also shied away from the subject, likely in deference to Justice Jacobs.

The rest of the panel was quite interesting. It included a discussion on the effectiveness of mandatory bylaw amendments to place litigation in a home state, likely Delaware, in which the lawyers put forth arguments why they were valid on contractual grounds. This is not surprising as these clauses tend to bring this litigation back home to Delaware. (I wrote about this issue last fall.)

There was also a discussion of Delaware’s law on appraisals, with Justice Jacobs describing the cases and the difficulty for judges in financially valuing companies as “medieval scholasticism.”

But the lack of discussion of the Airgas case was a disappointment. This was particularly true because — in between discussions of David L. Sokol, formerly of Berkshire Hathaway, and Nasdaq’s bid for NYSE/Euronext — the Air Products-Airgas battle was supposed to be the topic de jure at Tulane.
