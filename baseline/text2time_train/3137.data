On a first encounter, little about Mr. Rando cries out ''make 'em laugh.'' Tall and lean, with clean-cut good looks, he gives the impression of one better suited to orderliness than mayhem, one who might prefer to do his experimenting in a laboratory rather than on a stage. (He grew up in Houston, where his father is an aerospace engineer.) And his training was not exactly of the clown-college variety. After graduating from the University of Texas, where he concentrated in German, Italian and English literature, he won a Fulbright fellowship to study theater in Europe. He later did graduate work in theater at the University of California at Los Angeles.

Still, he shone in comic roles in undergraduate productions, and in his early stagings of plays like ''Twelfth Night'' he showed a flair for bringing the madcap elements of the classics fully to life. ''After a couple of shows at the Pearl, people would say to me, 'I'm really impressed by your style,' '' he recalled. ''Until someone said that, I didn't know I had a style.''

He is regarded by those who work with him as a genuine actors' director, a gentle source of encouragement who does not crowd the rehearsal room with his own ego. ''John laughs at every rehearsal,'' said Nancy Opel, an actress who is a favorite of both Mr. Ives and Mr. Rando and plays the corrupt proprietor of a public urinal in ''Urinetown.'' ''He laughs every time. If you think the director is tired of you, then you get restless.

''I would say if he had a fault, it's that he's probably too kind to actors. He's got a lot of patience with everybody and it takes a little longer to get to the result that he wanted because he's so willing to let people try things.''

Mr. Rando said he had learned that leadership could be a matter of pointing someone in the direction they were already headed. ''The way I like to work is that sometimes you do your best work when others are doing their best work,'' he explained. ''It's about coaching, prodding.''

And sometimes a firmer hand is required. In a tongue-in-cheek show like ''Urinetown,'' which was created by Mark Hollmann and Greg Kotis and pokes fun at everything from ''The Threepenny Opera'' to ''West Side Story,'' the challenge was to ensure the broad comedy did not become sophomoric. ''I knew that it needed to be as bare bones as I could make it,'' Mr. Rando said. To that end, the minimal scenery consists of a network of catwalks and a wall on wheels that serves a variety of functions; in one song, the wall is intentionally pitched so far downstage that the actors performing in front of it are pushed into the laps of theatergoers.

It is a bit of a leap from ''Urinetown'' to ''A Thousand Clowns,'' a play about a former television writer (Mr. Selleck) whose eccentric ways put his guardianship of his 12-year-old nephew into jeopardy. A 1996 revival by the Roundabout Theater Company was disappointing: hampered by the departures before the opening of its director and leading actors, the production felt dated. But Mr. Rando said the questions the play asked about personal responsibility had convinced him it could be as relevant today as it was in the early 1960's.
