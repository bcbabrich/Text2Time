Philip W. Bonsal, a career diplomat and the last United States Ambassador to Cuba, died Wednesday in his home here. He was 92.

He had been under treatment for pneumonia.

When Mr. Bonzal arrived in Havana in February 1959 as Ambassador, relations between the United States and the revolutionary Castro Government had already begun to deteriorate. But stepping off the plane, Mr. Bonsal shook hands with a bearded Castro emissary and congratulated him on the bravery of the revolutionaries who had overthrown the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista, which had been backed by Washington for many years.

The act was widely noted in the Cuban press, and Prime Minister Fidel Castro, later the Cuban President, expressed appreciation for his "friendly, cordial" approach.

Despite this auspicious beginning, Mr. Bonsal was unable to develop a dialogue with the revolutionary, and as nationalization of American-owned companies proceeded, his counsel of quiet negotiation was largely ignored in Washington.
