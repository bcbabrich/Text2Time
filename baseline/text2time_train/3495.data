''One minute it was nothing and the next minute it was smoke everywhere,'' he said. ''When it got real crazy in there, I had to let the guitar go. You couldn't see anything. I tripped over somebody. The young lady I was with fell and she kind of pulled me down. When you hit the floor you could breathe. I got up and followed the wall and I got to the cigarette machine and it was right near the door and I heard people saying, 'This way out,' which was really cool.''

Mrs. Acosta was near the bandstand when the announcement was made and by the time she reached the staircase it was treacherously crowded. ''You could not see your hand in front of your face,'' she said.

Almost everyone ignored the five other exit doors and headed out the way they had come in.

In the parking lot outside, firefighters were arriving as survivors madly scanned the crowd or tried to make their way back inside to find friends. Mr. Henderson looked around for his fellow musicians and found all but two. One was Mr. Chase, who had been his classmate at Benjamin Franklin High School in Manhattan and had lingered at the microphone to guide people to safety. The other was the keyboard player, Damon De Feis, 19, whom he had last seen covering up the organ he had been playing.

''We kind of knew,'' said Mr. Henderson, who is still a musician. ''But you don't want to believe. We just kept waiting and finally we went home.''

Mrs. Acosta, coughing from the smoke, sat with her date at a distance and gazed in disbelief at the frantic activity in the flaming shopping center. Mrs. Cassone's group got into her Volkswagen and went home. Sometime later, her brother Robert, a volunteer firefighter, arrived at the scene of the fire. Seeing a red Volkswagen parked in the lot, he assumed his sister was inside.

''They wouldn't let him go in,'' Mrs. Cassone recalled. ''So they made somebody drive him home to see if I was home.''

Firefighters -- in the technology of the day only a handful were equipped with breathing apparatus -- formed a chain and, blindly feeling their way, pulled out more than 100 unconscious or dazed people, but had to stop because of the intense heat. When the fire was finally doused, they saw a sodden, blackened jungle of twisted electric cables, charred bar stools and air-conditioning units that had caved through the roof. They found 24 bodies, killed by the smoke but so badly burned they had to be identified through dental X-rays.
