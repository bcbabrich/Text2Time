When John Flannery was named chief executive of General Electric last year, he said he would rethink the troubled business “with speed, urgency and no constraints.” In the next months, he sharply cut expenses and devised a plan to sell off large parts of the industrial giant.

But that wasn’t enough. On Monday, G.E. announced that it had replaced Mr. Flannery with H. Lawrence Culp Jr., who joined the company’s board in April.

The switch stunned analysts, since the industrial giant traditionally measured its leaders’ longevity by the decade. Jack Welch, the famed G.E. chief, led the company for 20 years, and Mr. Flannery’s predecessor, Jeffrey R. Immelt, was chief executive for 16 years.

It also underscored the depths of problems at G.E., once considered a model of management excellence. In addition to the leadership switch, the company said on Monday that it would “fall short” of its earnings guidance for the year and would write down the value of its struggling power generation business by about $23 billion — the latest in a series of disappointments for investors.
