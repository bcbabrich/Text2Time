Denzel Washington stars as Frank Lucas in "American Gangster." The film, directed by Ridley Scott, is based in rough outline on the flashy rise and fall of a powerful 1970s New York drug lord. "It's a seductive package," says Manohla Dargis, "crammed with all the on-screen and off-screen talent that big-studio money can buy, and filled with old soul and remixed funk that evoke the city back in the day, when heroin turned poor streets white and sometimes red."
