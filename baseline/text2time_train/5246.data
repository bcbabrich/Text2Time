Tomorrow is the busiest day so far this year for Kentucky Derby prep races, with 44 3-year-olds entered for four races in Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky and New Jersey. All but 8 of those 44 horses have been nominated for the Derby on May 7, and about half of them are being seriously considered for the race.

The biggest name in tomorrow's entries is Brian's Time, the Florida Derby winner, who heads a field of 11 in the $500,000 Jim Beam Stakes at Turfway Park. The Roberto colt's main competition at a mile and an eighth should come from Dynaformer, Stalwars and Kingpost. The others in the race, all Derby nominees, are Delightful Doctor, Cannon Dancer, Drouilly's Boy, Buck Forbes, Glory Afar, Jim's Orbit and Longview Ashley.

The Rebel Handicap at Oaklawn, the major prep for that track's Arkansas Derby April 23, drew a field of 10 Derby nominees headed by Notebook, who was third in the Florida Derby; Smackover Creek, undefeated in two starts, and Proper Reality, whom Jerry Bailey chose over Brian's Time as a Derby mount. Word Pirate, Morgan's Levee, Din's Dancer, Sea Trek, Contempt, Gallantmister and Hedevar the Bold complete the field for the mile race.

The $250,000 Tropical Park Derby at Calder, usually run in January but pushed to April this season amid Florida's chaotic racing politics, drew a weak field despite its fat purse. The leading 3-year-olds who wintered in Florida have been sent north rather than raced over Calder's unusual synthetic track surface. Digress, the trainer Woody Stephens's third-stringer, is the likely favorite against Zie World, Primal, Frosty the Snowman, Above Normal and six others at a mile and an eighth.
