In baseball, the best relief pitchers are those who “throw strikes,” as the managers like to say.

And last night, for the edification of 38,681 spectators at Shea Stadium, Ron Taylor threw strikes almost exclusively in preserving a 7‐6 victory for Jerry Koosman over the Pittsburgh Pirates and the triumph gave the New York Mets a two‐game grip on first place in the Eastern Division of the National League.

Koosman appeared about to produce his second consecutive complete‐game performance following his sore‐arm problems when Al Oliver doubled and Willie Stargell lofted a homer over the right‐field‐fence in the ninth inning.

With the Pirates only a run behind, Gil Hodges, the Mets’ manager, beckoned Taylor, his right‐hand man in the bull pen. Taylor threw 11 pitches, 10 of which were strikes, in disposing of Bill Mazeroski, Richie Hebner and a pinch‐hitter, Jose Pagan, for his ninth save of the season.

Three Up, Three Down

Mazeroski struck out on three pitches. Hebner, after two strikes, fouled off three pitches, then popped up. Pagan took ball and lined Taylor's next pitch to Ken Singleton in left field for the final out.
