French broadcast industry regulators officially gave the green light today to the inclusion of the Canal Plus pay television group in the $34 billion acquisition of the Seagram Company by the French conglomerate Vivendi.

The action came after Vivendi gave assurances that Canal Plus would maintain a high level of independence in its French operations.

The deal was formally approved by European antitrust regulators last month, but French regulators sought assurances that Canal Plus, which is now 49 percent controlled by Vivendi, would retain considerable independence in France.

Today's announcement removes the last possible hurdle to the deal, which was announced five months ago and is to be put to a vote by shareholders on Tuesday.
