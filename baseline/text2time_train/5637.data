The Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency said today that there was a ''strong possibility'' that some Americans remain alive in Indochina 14 years after the end of American participation in the Vietnam war.

But in a news conference at the Pentagon, the Director, Lieut. Gen. Leonard H. Perroots, said that ''I have no credible evidence, no strong compelling evidence'' to sustain the possibility.

The general declined to speculate on whether the Americans were being held prisoner or had remained in Indochina of their own will.

General Perroots appeared to be less positive in his assessment of the possibilities than Lieut. Gen. Eugene F. Tighe Jr. in an interview on Monday night.
