John Smart, a retired New York publisher, philanthropist and former chairman of Esquire Inc., died on Monday at Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut. A resident of Greenwich, he was 88.

The cause was complications following a stroke, his family said.

In recent years Mr. Smart devoted much of his time to the philanthropic activities of the Smart Family Foundation, based in Greenwich. The foundation had assets of close to $50 million in 1990. It chiefly supports education, focusing on projects that aid primary and secondary schoolchildren. Mr. Smart also supported Jewish philanthropy and a number of projects in Israel.

Mr. Smart and his two older brothers, David and Alfred, founded Apparel Arts, a trade publication, in 1931. That was followed two years later by Esquire magazine.

After his brothers died in the early 1950's, Mr. Smart took charge of the organization. He stabilized Esquire and converted Apparel Arts into the more successful Gentlemen's Quarterly. The parent company was Esquire, Inc., which also produced educational materials and textbooks.
