The Charlotte Hornets dismissed Coach Dick Harter yesterday and named the assistant coach, Gene Littles, as interim coach.

''At the present time, Mr. Shinn and I felt that a coaching change was necessary,'' the team president and general manager, Carl Scheer, said in a statement released in Charlotte, N.C. ''The decision wasn't made due to our wins and losses, we know that the building process is a long one and that was not a factor. But the development of our younger players and the team is our priority, and with that in jeopardy, a change was necessary.''

Harter, 58 years old, was 8-32 this season and 28-92 in a year and a half with the N.B.A. club.

''A coach is a key member of an organization. I hire skilled people thinking that they can do the job and give them the freedom to do their job,'' the Hornets' owner, George Shinn, said. ''A skill that a coach must have is communication and it came to the point where I couldn't, as the owner, communicate with Dick and I know that he had lost his communication link with the players.''(AP)
