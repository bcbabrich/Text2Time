One of New York City's major bond raters yesterday strongly criticized Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's preliminary budget proposal for the coming fiscal year, warning that it would lower the city's credit rating further if the Mayor failed to address risky assumptions in his proposal.

New York's rating is among the lowest of any major city in the country, with only Detroit, Philadelphia and Washington lower. Another downgrading would pull the city's rating down to just one step from junk-bond level. Low ratings cost the city millions of dollars a year in higher interest payments.

The rating agency, Moody's Investors Service, said the Mayor's plan relied too heavily on Federal and state financing that might not materialize and on budget actions that it derided as "one shots" -- fiscal gimmicks that fill a budget hole for one year but offer no long-term budget relief.

While the agency did not announce a downgrading of the city's bonds, it said it would keep the rating "under review" until a final budget is adopted in June -- an official signal to the city and its investors that the agency has serious concerns about the city's finances.
