''I sat down one day and said, 'This is what I'm going to do,' and people are paying attention,'' she said. ''We all get annoyed, but we really didn't know that others were equally furious. This seems to have struck a major chord. Even those of us who are most privileged are deprived of positive images of ourselves and of opportunities to learn. For black people, it's suicidal not to have these images, and for nonblacks it presents distortion. It makes them expect a world that doesn't exist.''

She said a view of a multicultural world is essential. ''In Fairfield County,'' she said, ''a lot of people have presumed that we don't need this. But we do.''

Ms. Adams said that over the years she has heard ''every negative that people can think of - blacks don't read, blacks don't buy books'' - as excuses for libraries and bookstores not to carry books about blacks or by lesser-known black authors. Black authors ''have to be extraordinary'' she said, for their work to be widely sold and distributed. She added that black literature tends to get fewer reviews, less advertising and less opportunity to reach the shelves of libraries and bookstores.

Ms. Adams, who is 43 years old, has worked as a playwright, as a writer for television and radio, and as host of an arts program on National Public Radio. Since 1985, she has run her own publishing company, Back Pax, which produces multicultural books and tapes for children. She started the book club with her own funds and those of three black entrepreneurs. After two years of research and development, the club was tested last summer at Black Family Reunion festivals held by the National Council of Negro Women in Atlanta, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Cincinnati and Washington.

''By the fifth test - in Washington - we began offering memberships. We were there for nine hours over two afternoons, and one person joined for every minute and a half that we were on the field,'' said Ms. Adams, who called the response overwhelming.
