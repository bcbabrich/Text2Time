Fin swimming, in which competitors use rubber fins to add a powerful boost to their kick, is a fast sport that has been making slow progress in the United States since it was imported from Europe a few years ago. Now one version of it seems to have reached its high-water mark.

The first United States Eastern Fin Swimming Championships, held March 21 at Westchester Community College in Valhalla, N.Y., were also billed as the first such meet anywhere in a short-course pool (25 yards) rather than in a 50-meter long-course. As a result of the experience, they may be the last. As the 15 entrants discovered, the speed advantage that fin swimming enjoys over barefoot swimming on long courses disappears when a short course is used, and for an obvious reason: The flippers that add so much power to a kick are a distinct disadvantage in making a flip turn.

In long-course events, the superiority of fins is substantial. For example, the world 50-meter freestyle record is 22.33 seconds, while the fin swimming record for the same event is a blistering 15.4. In the 100, the world swimming record is 48.74, while the fin swimming record is 38.2. (Fin records, incidentally, would presumably be even lower if the best swimmers took up the sport. As it is, fin swimmers tend to be scuba divers.) In the Eastern championships, Gary Antonick of Virgina Beach won the one-flip-turn 50-yard apnea, an underwater event, in 18.1 seconds, only slightly faster than the American swimming record of 19.22. Peppo Biscarini of Los Angeles, who had to use his flippers for three flip turns, won the 100-yard event in 43.3 seconds, actually slower than the finless record of 41.87.

The meet organizer, Frank May, who settled on the 25-yard Westchester pool only because there were no Olympic-size pools available in the metropolitan area, said later that he wasn't sure about an encore next year. In the meantime, he figures that the 1987 championships were a watershed: Every winner set a short-course record.
