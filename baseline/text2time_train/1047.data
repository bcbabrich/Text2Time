Among the farms Mr. Wildschut photographed was that of Peter Stroo’s in Slootdorp, home to 160,000 chickens. Workers are tasked with sterilizing the hatching “module,” a climate-controlled facility where chicks are raised for almost three weeks after hatching. Lighting, heating, ventilation, chick harvesting and manure removal are all integrated into the system, to save energy and reduce the environmental footprint.
