Mr. Hatch has scheduled a committee vote on Mr. Lee for Thursday, and Congressional officials say it is uncertain whether Mr. Lee can muster the 10 votes needed to send the nomination to the Senate floor. He presumably has support from the eight Democrats on the committee and maybe from one Repubican, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.

Republican Senators and other conservatives, who say the Administration's civil rights policies are too liberal, oppose Mr. Lee because of his unwillingness to disassociate himself from positions he took as the Western Regional Director of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, a liberal civil rights group, on affirmative action and school busing.

''We think that we have a decent chance of beating this nomination,'' said Clint Bolick, vice president for litigation of the Institute for Justice, a conservative group that opposes Mr. Lee. ''This is the one opportunity that the Senate has to express its outrage over the Clinton Administration's civil rights policies. Lee exemplifies an activist, pro-racial-preferences agenda. So this seems the right opportunity.''

The machinations around Mr. Lee are not unusual for a nominee to the top civil rights post, which has been a lightning rod for debate on some of the most contentious social issues the country faces, including busing, affirmative action and gay rights. Mr. Lee is the first person nominated to the post since the Republicans took over the Senate in 1994.

The choice of Mr. Lee is shaping up as a battle between the increasingly conservative Senate and the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, an organization that has supplied the last four Democratic nominees for Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights: Drew Days, Lani Guinier, Deval Patrick and, now, Mr. Lee.

In written questions, Republicans on the Judiciary Committee have sought to learn whether Mr. Lee would change his ways in his new job.

''There are several Republicans who are concerned,'' a Republican staff member said. ''While he did say he would just enforce the law if confirmed, given his answers and testimony and his failure to distinguish the positions he would take as head of Civil Rights Division from those he took at the NAACP, I think Republican senators have cause to question what his positions would be.''
