But in several cities, the yen to share New York's festivities has reached mass proportions. Near Los Angeles, in the city of Newport Beach, 1,500 people are expected to gather at the Newporter Resort, where the unveiling of the renovated Statue of Liberty will be monitored on 30 television sets, including 10 with large screens. In Dallas and in Boston's City Hall Plaza as well, giant outdoor televisions will show the event. Miamian Is Expectant

Huge numbers of people, of course, will be on hand in New York, including Mary Murphy, a 66-year-old Miamian whose hometown is planning nothing much for the holiday. She won first prize for the slogan ''Liberty is in all of us'' in the city-sponsored ''Search for Liberty'' contest, one of many contests around the country that offered a trip to New York as the grand prize.

''I really love New York,'' she said, adding that she and her sister will spend July 4 aboard the Spirit of Miami, the tall ship that will represent her city in New York Harbor. ''I still don't believe I'm going to have a front row seat at this historical event.''

For many around the country, Independence Day weekend will include athletic competition. On July 6, more than 1,000 men and women are expected to participate in the Liberty-to-Liberty Triathlon, a 107-mile swimming, bicycling and running race from Liberty State Park in New Jersey to the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. Before they climb into the Hudson River at the start of the race the athletes will sing the national anthem, and when they cross the finish line they will by met by Mayor W. Wilson Goode.

''If you can't beat New York, you can join them,'' said Dianne L. Semingson, Philadelphia's official promoter. Events Around the Nation

In a similar test of endurance, 24 marathoners from Houston have been running toward New York since June 22. If all goes as planned, the last of the runners, who have run continuously in relay teams, will reach the George Washington Bridge July 3.

In Detroit, where Independence Day is celebrated with Canada Day, which is July 1, residents of two nations will participate in a tug-of-war on July 2, yanking opposite ends of a rope that will stretch 2,350 feet across the Detroit River. And in the choppy waters of the San Francisco Bay, the architects of two yachts, both computer-designed, will stage a runoff to determine which one, the U.S.A. or the R-1, will be entered in the trials for the 1987 America's Cup race in Australia.

One thing there may be less of than usual is fireworks. Rising insurance premiums and growing public awareness about the dangers of fireworks have caused many towns to forfeit their displays, particularly in the Southwest, where dry, hot weather has increased the threat of fire. In Sierra Vista, Ariz., for example, the Rotary Club canceled its annual show when it could not raise the money for liability coverage. The cost would have been $2 million.
