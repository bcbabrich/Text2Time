Scientists have found a deficiency of a substance that is important to the normal functioning of cells in a small study of people infected with the AIDS virus.

The finding raises the question whether a deficiency of the substance, glutathione, leads to the collapse of the immune system that characterizes AIDS, scientists from the National Institutes of Health said in a report being published today in the British journal Lancet.

The study involved 14 men who were infected with the AIDS virus but had no symptoms and 19 men who were not infected. The amount of glutathione was reduced by up to one-half the usual levels in the men infected with the AIDS virus.

''We don't know how important the finding is,'' Dr. Ronald G. Crystal, one of the authors, said in an interview.
