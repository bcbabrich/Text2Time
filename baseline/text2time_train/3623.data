In the 1970's Michael Weller established himself as the unofficial biographer of the generation that came of age as flower children, chronicling their aspirations and inevitable disillusion in plays like ''Moonchildren'' and ''Loose Ends'' and in the screenplay for the movie of ''Hair.'' In ''Ghost on Fire,'' a poignant play suffused with humor, Mr. Weller writes their requiem.

When we first meet him in the mid-80's, Dan Rittman (Lee Sellars) is teaching screenwriting in New York, and an affair with a student has put his marriage to Julia (Betsy Aidem) in jeopardy. Suddenly out of the past arrives Neil Toomie (Nelson Avidon), a onetime sidekick to Dan and Julia when they made short documentary films together in their hippie days, ''when we believed everyone was important,'' as Dan explains at one point. Neil, a cameraman who stayed on in California when Dan and Julia abruptly left, is now married to a ditsy woman ''from the Bordeaux region of Texas'' and is in New York to work on a movie about ''drug abuse, or is it child abuse . . . one of the abuses.''

Neil, who keeps up a steady, glib banter increasingly tinged with bitterness, also may have found an Israeli who is willing to bankroll the big feature movie he and Dan always dreamed of making. But Neil also has a secret, which is revealed when his wife, Michelle (Dannah Chaifetz), arrives from California with some CAT scans showing he has an inoperable brain tumor.

''Ghost on Fire'' fills the stage with ably drawn characters: the vacuous but earnest soap opera actor who is so in love with Julia he has started reading philosophy (albeit at a page an hour) so he can carry on a conversation with her; a sex-obsessed doctor of dubious ethics who wants to be a poet; an upstairs neighbor who is still trying to ban the bomb; the Israeli producer with an amusing if imprecise command of English idiom and his leggy but erudite mistress.
