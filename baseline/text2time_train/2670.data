A preliminary investigation found no explosives in the car, the spokesman said. He added that the episode was "a very unfortunate, very tragic event, and we hate it when these kinds of things happen."

"We have had six suicide bombs in the last week against our units," said the spokesman. "At least one of them was a taxi, so you could understand the soldier's actions. He fired first at the engine block, but it continued to accelerate so the second time he shot into the cab, killing the driver."

In a meeting with reporters inside the heavily fortified Green Zone in Baghdad, Dr. Allawi ticked off what he said were recent successes in killing and capturing insurgents and their leaders in Iraq. He emphasized the capture of what he said were 167 fighters who had come from outside Iraq, but it was unclear whether they had come to the country recently to fight or had immigrated years ago.

He was unambiguous about his motivations in the gathering storm around Falluja.

"The terrorists and insurgents continue to use Falluja and the people of Falluja as a shield," Dr. Allawi said, giving a list of recent insurgent attacks. "That's why I cannot stand back and allow such attacks to continue."

Dr. Allawi said that he would keep pressing for a peaceful resolution but that "our patience is running thin."

Dr. Allawi declined to say much about something that has received intense discussion in the American presidential campaign in the past week -- the disappearance of hundreds of tons of powerful conventional explosives from Al Qaqaa, a weapons site south of Baghdad, around the time of the invasion of the country last year.

"I don't like to really have a premature comment," Dr. Allawi said, adding that he had ordered the "relevant authorities" to start an investigation. "Once we have the results," he said, "we will make a public statement."
