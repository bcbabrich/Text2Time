In a two-hour meeting today with Donald Fehr, the executive director of the union, Yankee players discussed the pros and cons of possible strike dates but did not discuss a firm date.

One player said the Yankees talked about the strategies associated with different strike dates. But, Fehr said, ''The board has not considered a strike date or when it would be.''

Players generally expressed some optimism after the meeting, and those who were active during the last work stoppage, in 1994-95, said the overall atmosphere was better now. Robin Ventura said he had ''guarded optimism,'' and Sterling Hitchcock said the issues dividing the players and the owners do not seem as substantial as they did eight years ago.

''I think it's just a matter of whether the people who are going to the table want to do it,'' he said. ''Last time around, they were really wanting to change the system, and they got what they wanted the last time as far as luxury taxes and revenue sharing. To me, now it's just tinkering with numbers. It doesn't seem like it is as tough a battle this time. It's just a matter of the willingness.''
