Each time an American airline sells a ticket, it assumes a responsibility for the traveler that goes beyond the proper maintenance of its equipment. Today, airport searches and luggage checks represent a commitment to every passenger's protection against hijackers. A traveler should be able to board a United States carrier with confidence that American security standards are being observed at every stop along the route.

If the authorities at a foreign airport cannot or win not adequately police their traffic, then our airlines have an obligation to protest and, if necessary, to seek permission to do the job themselves. If they are refused, they must at least inform potential passengers of the risk, and may be justified in cutting off service. If the United States Government wishes to discourage such a cutoff, it should in turn assume the responsibility for assuring that the delinquent nation provide adequate airport security—surely a lighter responsibility than having to rescue hostages after a hijacking.

That is the impressive logic of the West German Government in following up its spectacular rescue of hijacked passengers in Somalia with actions designed to make such dangerous derring‐do unnecessary. It has successfully pressured the Spanish Government to permit Lufthansa, the German airline, to manage rigorous security arrangements for all Germany‐bound flights from Palma, Majorca, the embarkation point of the hijackers.

There have been 27 air hijackings so far this year, compared to 16 for all of 1976. Experience shol,Vs that stringent screening, like that now applied at United States airports, can deter hijackers. But every country is responsible for its own security, and not all maintain our standards. Palma is only one of the airports where security has been lax. Bonn is reported to have sent its guards to 13 other airports, including Barcelona, Bombay, Istanbul, Algiers, Dakar and Tripoli, and it has threatened to ban planes from countries where controls are inadequate. West Germany's actions should be an example to other governments and airlines, including our own.
