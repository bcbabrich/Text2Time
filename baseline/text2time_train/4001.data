Prime Minister Romano Prodi's new center-left Government passed a critical test in the Chamber of Deputies today, winning a vote of confidence with the "conditional" help of 35 hard-line leftist deputies whose support it needs for a majority.

Coming after a victory in the Italian Senate last week, the 322-to-299 vote in Parliament's lower house gives the new Government full powers, six weeks after a leftist-leaning coalition won national elections for the first time in Italian history.

But the Olive Tree, the new group headed by the politically untested Mr. Prodi, fell short of a majority of seats in the 630-member Chamber of Deputies. It will have to rely on the small Communist Refounding Party, a splinter group of far-leftists, to carry out a program that mixes fiscal austerity with political change.

Mr. Prodi, who went to Germany this week on his first foreign visit as Prime Minister, has signaled his determination to reduce Italy's deficit. He is preparing to bring the lira back into Europe's exchange rate mechanism by the end of the year and eventually to qualify for the European currency union.
