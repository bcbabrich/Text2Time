GROWING UP in small-town South Jersey, I never heard the words ''deer problem'' until decades later, when I was working in upstate New York. One winter day, a normally mild-mannered colleague trudged in, fuming about his near-death highway experience. The previous night, a deer had bounded from the woods and onto the hood of his car. Deer and car were totaled.

''This country has absolutely got to do something about the deer problem!'' he shouted.

''Like what?''

''Like napalm.''

Now, this is probably not the sort of attitude one ought to convey to animal-rights advocates who have been camped out for a couple of days and nights in a cold November rain to protest a deer hunt. Nevertheless, a few of them managed tight smiles the other day when I stopped at the bivouac they had made outside the entrance of Lewis Morris Park, down Route 24 past Morristown, to ask what was so awful about the Morris County Parks Commission's sending in a squad of trained hunters to kill a few hundred bothersome Bambis? The deer are devastating the vegetation in the 1,150-acre county park -- and wandering outside to devour the neighbors' azaleas to boot.

For a committed animal-rights advocate with wet feet, a woman in her second day of a three-day hunger strike, Anne Crimaudo of Caldwell, showed remarkable patience with the question.
