AT the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, a part-time plasterer from Cheltenham, England, nicknamed Eddie the Eagle demonstrated with hilarious ineptitude how the agony of victory was never as much fun as the thrill of defeat.

Eddie the Emu would have been a more appropriate name. The ski-jumping skills of Eddie Edwards were more suitable to hopscotch than skiing. He learned to jump in oversized boots that required five pairs of socks and wore a helmet tied to his head with string.

If his glasses were as thick as Coke bottles, it was just as well, because where he was going, he probably didn't want to see. The first time he hurled himself off a mountain, Edwards said, ''I was so frightened that my bum shriveled up like a prune.''

Couch Potatoes, Unite!

He finished last on the hill but first in the public imagination precisely because he was less an athlete than he was a tourist. If was as if he were appearing in an Olympic version of ''The Purple Rose of Cairo,'' a couch potato who walked through the television screen and found himself in the Winter Games.
