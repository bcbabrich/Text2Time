All such protective innocence has been stripped from the adults. But life-long reluctant fliers like Deborah Yost now have far fewer reasons to apologize for their white-knuckle behavior. She made an elaborate sign of the cross three times in taking off on a recent flight from Oregon to Nebraska, prompting more envy than consternation for some witnesses.

As passengers look below, they ponder how the beauty of flight could be so perverted to doom; the mood in the skies seems to be shifting painfully from mournful to redemptive.

''Now more than ever, this is safer,'' a pilot firmly told a few doubting passengers on a jetway in Virginia. The group demonstrated a new airport phenomenon -- the scrapping of the old taboo against openly discussing security threats. From the cockpit, the same pilot vowed a safe flight for all. ''I know people like you are not going to let them get us down,'' he announced, ascending from Dulles Airport. ''God bless America.''

As passengers return, the Sept. 11 tragedy becomes an eerily routine part of the conversation agenda in the snaking airport lines.

''Oh, those poor people blown to bits,'' a gray-haired woman said to a stranger as they inched along three hours before a flight at Logan.

Scraps of optimism can be heard in the same lines.

''You got the prices on those valves and cam locks?'' a waiting man shouted on his cellphone. The invincible American drummer is back, resuming his sales route with welcome boorishness.

In the slow return to flying, a new kind of aggravation is evolving. Passengers obediently arriving three hours early here can wonder whether wordplay is intended in the countless American flag signs proclaiming, ''We Stand Together.''
