Israeli officials said today that they had turned over a 60-page chronology of Israel's activities in the Iran affair to United States Congressional investigators on Wednesday.

The chronology is said to detail Israel's activities from the beginning of the Iran affair in early 1985 until Dec. 31, 1985.

This was the period during which the Israeli operation was mostly being conducted by David Kimche, then director general of the Foreign Ministry, along with two Israeli arms dealers, Jacob Nimrodi and Al Schwimmer.

The chronology is primarily based on interviews with these three, as well as with other senior Israeli military and foreign affairs officials.
