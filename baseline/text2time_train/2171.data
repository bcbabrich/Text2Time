TheStreet.com is reporting that Texas, not California, Florida, New York or Arizona, is the hottest area in the nation’s housing market for builders. While orders for new homes are declining in major metropolitan areas of those states, orders for homes in the four major Texas cities of Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin are up, according to the article.

Texas is also helping the largest homebuilders post good order numbers because orders are down in other parts of the country. For example, the article says the homebuilder Centex is having problems with growth in the mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest and a couple areas of California — but orders were up 28% in the Southwest, largely due to Texas sales. The article quotes Stephen East, an analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group, saying this about Centex’s homebuilding boom in Texas: “When it comes to orders this quarter (for Centex), the Texas region delivered as well as the university did in the Rose Bowl.” –RON NIXON
