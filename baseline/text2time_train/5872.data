Adjustable rates, which became commonplace in home mortgages as interest rates soared, are fast becoming fixtures in auto loans, the backbone of the consumer loan industry.

Jerry Alderman Ford in Indianapolis, for example, was one of the first to offer the new loans, starting two years ago. ''I can count on one hand the number of times our customers have gone the fixed-rate route,'' Steven Edging, vice president and general manager, said. ''Variable- rate loans are here to stay.''

John R. Gilker, Ford's manager of marketing and credit, said Ford's move was ''an experiment to test the market reaction; this is an idea that's taking hold in certain parts of the country, and we want to be competitive with the marketplace.''

In a fixed-rate loan, borrowers know how much they will repay at what interest rate. But in an adjustable- or variable-rate loan, whether for a house or car, the interest rate, and thus the final cost, may change.
