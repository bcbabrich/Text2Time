The Deluxe Corporation said yesterday that it planned to close more than half its check-printing plants and to eliminate 1,200 jobs in the next two years. The company said it would record expenses of $30 million to $35 million in the first quarter to pay for the closings. Deluxe, which previously said it would close five plants, said yesterday that it would close 21 more, leaving 15 open. The company, based in St. Paul, estimated that the closings would affect 2,400 full-time and 600 part-time workers at the 26 plants. The company said, however, that it expected to add as many as 1,800 positions to the remaining plants by expanding the number of work shifts. The company said it expected more staff cuts in the next two years.
