This season, “I don’t know if it’s really a hair style. It’s more of a feeling,” said the hairstylist Paul Hanlon, backstage at Nina Ricci’s spring/summer 2017 show. He was describing the ease and carefree attitude of being on vacation — specifically in the case of this season’s Nina Ricci woman, on holiday in South America. To embody that attitude, Hanlon created a look that evoked a steamy tropical environment: hair, moist from the humidity, but also with a bit of a dry, wavy texture from the air and salt water — and spontaneously pulled back. “It looks like she’s just been running her hands though her hair, pulling it off her face, off her shoulders,” Hanlon said. (The makeup artist Diane Kendel seemed drawn to the feverish South American nights too, most especially with the eyes, which she shadowed in shimmering shades of bronze and aquamarine-turquoise blue.)

Hanlon said he gleaned inspiration from pictures in Bruce Weber’s book “O Rio De Janeiro.” He created the “feeling” with Tigi’s “After Party” moisturizing cream, running the cream through the entire length of dry, unwashed hair with a comb or fingers, and adding a touch of hair clay at the roots to keep strands close to the head. Straight locks, meanwhile, received a slightly unkempt wave with a wide-barrel curling iron.
