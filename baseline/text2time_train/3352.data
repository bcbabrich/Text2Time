That was then, and this is now. But now, racing incredibly is getting a second chance. Now, Fusaichi Pegasus has ended his four-month absence by winning the Jerome Handicap at Belmont Park last weekend with class and command, and racing has rediscovered the thrill that comes with a great race horse. Or, as it surmised last spring, with two great race horses: Pegasus, the 3-year-old winner of the Kentucky Derby, and Lemon Drop Kid, the 4-year-old winner of last year's Belmont Stakes and of this year's Brooklyn, Suburban, Whitney and Woodward.

They have suddenly become rivals for Horse of the Year, and they are facing two theatrical chances to settle the issue: the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park on Oct. 14 and the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs on Nov. 4. What more could racing want?

But this is where fact and fancy collide. Maybe it is too obvious, two horses racing twice to see which one is truly the Horse of the Year. Maybe it lacks the complicated charm (and controversy) fanned by business ''solutions'' to the identity crisis threatening the sport. The National Thoroughbred Racing Association proposes to streamline its operations with a sophisticated technology network that might cost somebody between $100 million and $200 million. Frank Stronach's Magna Entertainment is looking into the idea of creating a national thoroughbred league with three or four franchises of 30 horses and ''teams'' of five horses.

Suppose they had banked on Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet for such a league this summer but then found both stars injured? If Mark McGwire gets hurt, the St. Louis Cardinals still report for the playoffs. But if Fusaichi Pegasus gets hurt, does Neil Drysdale send in a pinch-runner? In racing, you can't write the perfect script. Horses are individuals, owned and trained by individuals, with differing goals and motives.

Stronach, who owns various racetracks, probably said it best when searching for reasons Fusaichi Pegasus had lost the Preakness to his Red Bullet: ''Horses aren't machines.'' Call it the X factor. It's what makes racing dramatic. Maddening, true, but utterly dramatic because it follows no script. The enticing part is voiced by John Terranova, the trainer of Gander, who was third in the Woodward: ''Fusaichi Pegasus is in a different universe as far as horses go.''
