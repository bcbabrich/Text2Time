A Federal district judge here has removed the last Federal obstacle to construction of a 2.4-mile-long highway that will provide easy access between downtown Atlanta and the Carter Presidential Center. He ruled that state highway officials had satisfied all environmental concerns.

The decision by the judge, William C. O'Kelley, handed down last week, does nothing, however, to remove local opposition to the $22 million Presidential Parkway, nor does it lift an injunction imposed by the Georgia Supreme Court.

Alva Byrom, an engineer in the State Highway Department, said that the Federal ruling ''obviously relieves us of any problems with the Federal Government.'' But highway officials will still have to get the Georgia court to lift its injunction if it is to proceed with condeming land for the road.

The State Supreme Court ruled in November that the Highway Department could not condemn land under a television broadcast tower owned by Cox Communications because motorists could be endangered by falling ice, which sometimes forms on the tower's guy wires. Mr. Byrom said, ''We intend to finalize the right of way and settle with Cox, but I have no idea when that will be.'' Appeal Almost Certain
