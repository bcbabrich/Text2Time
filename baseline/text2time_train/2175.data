Or at least the personal financial advisers to the chief executive of Oracle, who is one of the richest men in the world, have worries. The San Francisco Chronicle published memos from Larry Ellison’s financial adviser detailing concerns that the executive was spending too much on his homes.

Ellison is famous for reportedly spending $200 million recreating a Japanese-style home in Woodside, Calif. He also has other homes in San Francisco, Malibu and elsewhere.

The article asks the important question that anyone struggling with a mortgage must be asking now:

So how could someone with $17 billion cause his accountant to worry about running low on cash? Ellison, who identifies strongly with the company he founded in 1977, has been famously unwilling to sell Oracle shares over the years. Instead of selling them, he has financed his lavish lifestyle — the 23-acre Japanese-style estate in Woodside, the yachts, the airplanes, the Armani suits — by borrowing against his stock. “I know this e-mail may/will depress you,” Simon wrote in a 2002 note about diversification. “However, I believe it’s my job to address issues you’d prefer not to confront. You told me years ago that it’s OK to raise the ‘diversification issue’ with you quarterly. … Well, I’m doing so. View this as a call to arms.”

The problem with borrowing, aside from the carrying charges, against stock is that if the price of the stock falls, you may have to sell assets at fire sale prices to cover the shortfall or the bank calls the loan. — DAMON DARLIN
