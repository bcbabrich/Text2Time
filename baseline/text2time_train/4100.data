1963-1994 John C. Russell, a harshly poetic commentator on the urban homosexual world, was a versatile playwright -- one of his works was about suburban high school kids. For Russell, gay love was complex, passionate, often funny. His plays were read at the New Dramatists and at Joe Papp's Public Theater; some were staged off-off-Broadway. When he died of AIDS, he was just finding his voice. In this scene from his last play, "Dante and Virgil Go Dancing," a character called He Who Dances in Shadow speaks.

HE WHO DANCES IN SHADOW: Don't know when it happened. Well, I guess it was a Wednesday, but I have no month, no definitive time marker, no broad-based context. Except I was in one of my transitional phases. Restless and deadly curious. I remember thinking I had to go out that night or my thirst for narrative would never be satisfied. I could envision a volume of stories left unlived -- what a waste that would be. I had to go out. And of course, I was right. If I hadn't gone out that night, I would never have met the boy from Albany, and if I had never met the boy from Albany, I would be a greatly diminished person. I was flinging my body around wistfully, with camp aplomb, with my usual, let's call it "panache," at the club I went to every Wednesday night because I got on the guest list because I once slept with the D.J., who happens to be the best and corniest D.J. in New York, and as I spun around under the scarlet light and plunged my feet into the plank wood floor I kept catching the eye of a tall skinny guy with a leather cap on holding a juicy blond boy. I kept throwing my eyes on them as I spun and they kept catching them. I never know how to speak to people, so he spoke to me. The skinny one. The boy from Albany. We held eyes and we danced and he did all the information. He had a rebel voice, an outlaw voice, a man voice, with boy eyes and almost no hair. I love a good hard voice spewing obscenities. He had knowledge of the world and anger at it. He had warmth towards people he didn't entirely respect. He jumped as dancing, much like I do, and he was happy. And that's what slayed me. What I couldn't get. Not for the life of me. I stepped out of myself, out of my bouncing body and planned a whole interrogation which never happened. As the light bathed me, as we kissed long and deep, as we threw our bodies across the dance floor, as we kissed and held the blond boy, and especially as I rooted my feet into the floor a foot away from his, leaving him briefly to dance his own dance, as I glared at his separateness, this incredible urge came over me to get the truth from him.

Hey, boy. Hey, boy from Albany. Gotta tell me. Where'd ya get that joy? Cuz it doesn't seem readily obtainable, lord knows I haven't had it for quite some time if I ever did have it with the glorious milk-colored purity that you have it in. You have dirt in you, you have a howling in you, yet you still manage somehow to lift, to soar. Seems I'm always hovering near to ground, I've always got some claw of iron curled into my shoulder blade, cold metal danger and brutality pushing pain into my nervous system. Where'd ya get that joy? Is it some kind of youth thing? I only have a few years on you, an extra pile of dread, just a bit more panic in my blood. Our eyes keep linking, so I can't be that separate from you. So why am I not you? Why don't I have that joy? You see the dangers but they don't penetrate your skin. Not one callous on your heart, not one! Why? How? With me, even dancing, the blackness cannot be lifted. Even in this red room, Bananarama inanely singing, your beautiful face, and still I hear the fire screams. So where'd ya get that joy?
