To others, he represents the only hope for peace and independence for his fragile fledgling country. Despite the flawed administration of the Palestinian Authority and the divisions among Palestinians, no alternative has emerged.

There was no mistaking where the crowd of 2,000 or so stood tonight. They cheered wildly and chanted as Mr. Arafat held the torch aloft. Nisreen Turki, 7, waved a Palestinian flag and clutched her father's hand as she strained for a glimpse of the legendary leader.

Almost as quickly as he had arrived, Mr. Arafat was gone. After less than three minutes and without a word to the faithful, he was whisked from the stage and hustled to a waiting car.

But Mr. Arafat seemed reluctant to leave the adoration behind. He stopped and thrust his fingers in the air in the shape of a V to the delight of the crowd before disappearing into a black Mercedes with bulletproof glass.

A few minutes later, Mr. Arafat's New Year's message was broadcast on Palestinian radio and television. It was a mixture of defiance and moderation, a call for peace and for firmness in a time of violence. ''The Palestinian people who choose peace as a strategic choice stand today on solid ground,'' he said. ''They will not be weakened and will not be humiliated and their rights will not be wasted as long as we have blood pulsing through our veins.''

Mr. Arafat's mother-in-law, Rimonda Taweel, was standing with three friends not far from the stage after Mr. Arafat's departure today. They had been arguing about the prospects for peace, but they agreed that there was no chance without Mr. Arafat.

''If Arafat fails, you will never find anybody with the authority to sign the peace treaty,'' said Madhat Awartami, a businessman in a leather jacket.
