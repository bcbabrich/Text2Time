Once upon a time people thought Joe Namath was a long-haired rebel.

Today, the 54-year-old, happily married father of two girls had advice for the Jets' most controversial player, Keyshawn Johnson: apologize to Wayne Chrebet.

Asked to respond to Namath's suggestion, Johnson said no.

Some of Namath's controversies during the 1960's seem quaint now -- sporting a Fu Manchu mustache, donning pantyhose for a commercial. There was, however, a more painful period for Namath when he briefly retired after refusing to sell his interest in a restaurant, Bachelors III, that the National Football League security office believed was a hangout of alleged mob figures.

The controversy swirling around Johnson's book appears to be lingering longer than its sales. In ''Just Give Me the Damn Ball!'' the receiver described his rookie season in passages interspersed with capital letters and bold face and italic sentences, and he called Chrebet the team mascot and suggested he would have a hard time making other teams. There were also passages of grudging praise for Chrebet, the workmanlike receiver from Hofstra University.

''If, in fact, he did say that Chrebet couldn't play for any other team in the N.F.L., Keyshawn better look in the mirror or listen to somebody,'' Namath said. ''He's got to understand he's wrong.''
