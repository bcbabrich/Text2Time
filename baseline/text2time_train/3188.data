Fernando Ferrer and Mark Green continued to trade barbs yesterday over plans to rebuild Lower Manhattan and whether Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani should be allowed to stay on after his term ends, as each candidate tried to suggest -- in the time-honored political tradition -- that the other one started it.

Mr. Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, also distanced himself from comments that a key supporter, the Rev. Al Sharpton, made on Saturday. Mr. Sharpton suggested that Mr. Giuliani had been excessively praised for his handling of the World Trade Center crisis and said that ''we would have come together if Bozo was the mayor.'' Mr. Ferrer said that he ''would have chosen far different language.''

Eleven days before the runoff election between Mr. Ferrer and Mr. Green for the Democratic mayoral nomination, the campaign, which was mostly suspended in the aftermath of the attack on World Trade Center, began to look like its old self again, with each candidate visiting several churches and holding impromptu news conferences.

And for all their sparring, the two Democrats sounded remarkably similar at times: Mr. Ferrer said that the twin towers of the city were hope and opportunity, while Mr. Green said that they were heroism and altruism.
