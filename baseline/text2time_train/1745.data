Though you’ll never see Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and Elvis Presley reunite on this plane of existence, a Broadway show that brings them together may be the next best thing. On Tuesday, the producers of the musical “Million Dollar Quartet” said that they planned to bring their show, based on a 1956 recording session that brought that famous foursome together at Sun Records in Memphis, to Broadway in the spring.

In a news release, publicists for the musical, which is presently playing at the Apollo Theater in Chicago, said that the Broadway production would be directed by Eric Schaeffer. Its score is comprised of vintage rock songs made famous by those singers, including “Blue Suede Shoes,” “Folsom Prison Blues” and “Whole Lotta’ Shakin’ Goin’ On,” and its book is by Colin Escott and Floyd Mutrux. The Chicago production features Brian McCaskill (as Sam Phillips), Rob Lyons (as Carl Perkins), Lance Guest (as Johnny Cash), Levi Kreis (as Jerry Lee Lewis) and Eddie Clendening (as Elvis Presley). No casting or theater was announced for the Broadway production, which is produced by Relevant Theatricals, John Cossette Productions, Northern Lights Inc., Broadway Across America, and James L. Nederlander.
