To the Editor:

In her review of ''The Loony-Bin Trip,'' Rosemary Dinnage asks, ''Should not . . . psychiatric staff take antipsychotic medication for a time as part of their training in order to know what it feels like?'' No. The reason is that ''what it feels like'' differs depending upon the state of mind of the subject at the time. Given to a patient already depressed, these antipsychosis medications intensify the experience of anguish and distress. Given to someone in a normal state of mind, the drug creates a distressing sense of enervation. Given to the acute psychotic, however, it provides a very welcome relief.

Most manics, no matter how bad their judgment is, resist taking medication that threatens to take away their mania. They enjoy the mania in the same way that individuals who are high on cocaine enjoy their high and do not willingly give it up. Both will come for treatment only when they have crashed into depression.

As characterized by Ms. Dinnage, Kate Millett's argument is not correct: mania is not creative. Hypomania, that is, a state of exhilaration in which judgment is not seriously impaired, can be extremely creative. Because of the impairment of judgment that accompanies it, mania is disruptive and destructive, though it is not recognized as such until the individual recovers from it.
