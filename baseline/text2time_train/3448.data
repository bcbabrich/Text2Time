A Union County jury yesterday convicted a minister in Jersey City of charges that he sexually assaulted a girl in his parish over a six-year period beginning when she was 10 years old.

The assaults began in the summer of 1991, after the minister, William J. Gray, 41, met the victim at St. Mary's Evangelical Christian Church on Martin Luther King Drive, said Doreen Yanik, an assistant Union County prosecutor. The assaults began as touching and escalated as the victim got older, Ms. Yanik said.

Mr. Gray faces up to 20 years in prison on the most serious of the nine counts against him, aggravated sexual assault. But Ms. Yanik said she would ask for a life sentence because of his convictions for assault and drug dealing in 1980 and 1986.

His lawyer, Robert A. Seelenfreund, said he would appeal. He said the victim had made three similar accusations against other people, all of them unsubstantiated.
