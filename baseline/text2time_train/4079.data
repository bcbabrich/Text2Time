Explaining the Nonexistent

If Mr. Nakamura's figures are accurate, much of the economic debate of the last couple of decades has been misguided, with economists and others trying to explain a decrease in productivity growth and a slowdown of economic growth that either did not exist or was much milder than the official statistics indicated.

And if the estimates are right, that doesn't alter the fact that the economy has produced quite real anxiety -- that if things are so good how come so many people feel so swamped with bills they can't afford to pay?

The very technological leadership and improvement that Mr. Nakamura hails as so important in boosting real productivity and holding down inflation have hurt some industries, and their workers, while creating whole new ones. For many Americans, it has been a period of economic pain, as more have gone to work for longer hours just to maintain their living standards. But statistics on the broad economy are supposed to capture averages, and it may be that those in pain were not typical.

It's likely that the Boskin panel will come up with numbers indicating that inflation was not as severely overstated -- and economic growth not as robust -- as Mr. Nakamura says it was. But it seems clear that the economic stagnation portrayed in years of statistics has reflected flaws in the numbers, at least to some extent, rather than in the economy.

Why do inflation numbers matter so much? In large part, it is because the Government, like anyone else, can only directly measure nominal numbers. You know how much money you made last year, and how much you are making this year. But to know what an increase really means, you have to adjust for inflation. If the rate of inflation is overstated, your real gain will be understated.

A percentage point or two doesn't sound like much, but over time the effect can be dramatic. It is all the more dramatic if, as Mr. Nakamura contends but some doubt, the overstatements have been getting worse.

Consider the reported decline in real wages. It has led to a debate with some pointing to free trade as a destroyer of high-paid American jobs and others pointing to excessive Government regulation. But Mr. Nakamura contends that real hourly wages rose by an average of 1.45 percent a year during the 21-year period. That is not as rapid a gain as the 1.6 percent of the previous decade, but there would have been less hand-wringing had the Government reported increases.
