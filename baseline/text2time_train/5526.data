Israeli troops and their Lebanese Christian allies were reported today to have stormed a Shiite Moslem village in southern Lebanon and forced its entire population of about 2,000 to leave.

The police here said Israeli soldiers and militiamen of the Israel-allied South Lebanon Army ringed the village, Kunin, in the Israeli-designated ''security zone,'' and ordered all the inhabitants to gather in the village square.

There, according to witnesses quoted by the police, 32 young men were rounded up and the rest of the villagers were ordered to move out.

A number of houses were blown up and set on fire, according to an account today in An Nahar, the Beirut daily.
