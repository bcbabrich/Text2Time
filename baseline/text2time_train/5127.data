Eclecticism was the order of the evening on Thursday when the Dance Theater of Harlem presented the fourth and last new program of its spring season at City Center Theater (131 West 55th Street), where the company performs through Sunday. It was also a night of exuberance on both sides of the stage. But the program's new work, ''The Cape,'' was a disappointment.

Gail Kachadurian, the former New York City Ballet dancer who choreographed the piece, certainly has the courage of her convictions, for her interest in dark epic ballets is not a popular one. Her heart is clearly in the right place. And her apparent theme - repression and its consequences - has a painful extra timeliness today.

But the ballet is extremely slight and predictable. Its story is of a father who, about to be executed by soldiers, passes along a precious cape to his son. Hiding under the cape on what looked like a giant slab of head cheese to one side of the stage, the boy and his girlfriend exchange clothes and trick the father's three murderers, killing two of them and escaping.

Neither the storytelling nor the cape have enough resonance to give the ballet the extra weight of a fairy tale or allegory. Miss Kachadurian has limited herself to a very small vocabulary of steps and gestures. The characters are such stock figures that there is little for the dancers to work with.
