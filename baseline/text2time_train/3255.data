THE REPUBLICANS

BOB JONES RESPONDS -- Bob Jones University, the fundamentalist Christian institution that has become a lightening rod since Gov. George W. Bush of Texas visited it during the South Carolina campaign, has responded on its Web site to attacks against it. The university described Senator John McCain of Arizona, Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley, as ''the political 'three tenors,' '' who together ''sing the same off-pitch tune of the liberal left.'' The university previously declined to respond to requests for comment. ''Isn't it really a compliment to Bob Jones University that the likes of John McCain, Al Gore and Bill Bradley seethe and fulminate against us?'' the statement said. The university said its policy against interracial dating was based on its understanding of the story of the Tower of Babel. ''The university wishes to give God the benefit of the doubt and avoid pursuing any direction that would give assistance to the renewed efforts of man to create a one-world community, consisting of one religion, one economy, one government, and one race,'' the statement said. The university denied that it hates Catholics, saying instead it believes it had a biblical mandate to preach salvation by faith alone to Catholics, Jews, Buddhists, Mormons, Muslims, atheists and ''unbelieving and religiously liberal Protestants.'' The statement said it regarded Catholicism on theological grounds as ''false.'' Gustav Niebuhr (NYT)

BETWEEN GOVERNORS -- Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma has some neighborly advice for Mr. Bush. Mr. Keating, a devout Roman Catholic and early supporter of Mr. Bush, has suggested that the Bush campaign schedule a speech at a major Catholic university to counter any hint of anti-Catholic bias that might have emerged after Mr. Bush's appearance at Bob Jones University in the South Carolina primary campaign. Noting that Mr. Bush was at a Catholic center in Cleveland yesterday, Ari Fleischer, a campaign spokesman, said, ''We do appearances at faith-based organizations all the time, so we rule nothing out.''

THE DEMOCRATS

GORE IN LOS ANGELES -- Campaigning in Los Angeles today, Vice President Al Gore referred only briefly to his rival, former Senator Bill Bradley, criticizing his health care plan. He had an interview with Univision, which he was asked to conduct in Spanish. He declined, saying, though, that he once ''was completely fluent.'' At a fund-raiser where he raised $100,000, he paid homage to the ''wonderful mosaic'' in the audience of Indians, Pakistanis, Jews, Koreans and Latinos. Katharine Q. Seelye (NYT)

THE POLLS

OHIO LEANS TO BUSH -- In Ohio, the first independent statewide poll of likely Republican voters taken since the primaries in South Carolina and Michigan showed Mr. Bush ahead of Mr. McCain, 53 percent to 36 percent. The poll of 386 likely Republican voters, questioned on Wednesday through Sunday, was released on Tuesday by the Institute for Policy Research at the University of Cincinnati. A similar poll of likely Democratic voters showed Mr. Gore ahead of former Mr. Bradley, 66 percent to 22 percent. The margin of error is plus or minus five percentage points. In Maryland, another state with a March 7 primary, Mr. Bush led Mr. McCain 47 percent to 40 percent in a Potomac Survey Research poll of likely voters for The Baltimore Sun. The poll, released yesterday, showed Mr. Gore ahead 58 percent to 23 percent. The margin of error was plus or minus five percentage points. David E. Rosenbaum (NYT)
