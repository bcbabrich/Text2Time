The convenience of on-line shopping has appeal from the biggest to the smallest purchases. Two of the fastest-growing categories are on-line purchases of automobiles and groceries. Though some of the initial department store efforts to sell fashion on line have been flops, some merchants are finding that they can tap into the same market that buys clothes from catalogues.

''If you know how a pair of Eddie Bauer jeans fits, you don't need to go to the store to buy it,'' said Ms. Brown of America Online.

It is that same quest for convenience that propelled the mail-order business over the last two decades and that is driving many people on line. Internet stores are open around the clock and are equally accessible to people around the world.

''The malls are getting more and more crowded,'' said Robert Fisher, president of Gap Inc., which started selling jeans and gifts on its Web site two weeks ago. ''Customers will come on line and find an easy place to shop.'' The Gap's site re-creates some of the experience of store shopping with a computer animation section that allows users to see how various combinations of shirts, pants and shoes will look together.

The peak shopping hours are late morning to early afternoon, as buyers take advantage of the faster Internet access offered on many office computers. But the Internet caters to night owls, as well. Forty percent of the purchases on America Online occur after 9 P.M.

Another appeal of on-line shopping is the prospect of finding a bargain. With lower operating costs, some companies are offering significant discounts. Amazon.com Inc., the on-line bookseller, offers some titles at 40 percent off the list price. A series of searches conducted by the accounting firm Ernst & Young found that for 90 percent of a basket of gifts -- ranging from cordless drills to cameras to bunches of roses -- the Internet offers better deals than traditional stores.

Yet not everyone can find all those bargains. For many, on-line shopping is filled with all the exasperation that accompanies many of the other highly promoted and imperfectly realized features of the Internet. The most frequent complaint from on-line shoppers is that finding and buying things is slow and complex. Some of that is caused by the delays inherent in Internet connections, particularly the slow speed of the modems that people use to connect from home. But many sites, shoppers say, are so poorly organized that shopping can be about as efficient as using a phone book that is not in alphabetical order.
