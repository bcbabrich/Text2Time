After an unfortunate incident today, nobody had to remind Tiger Woods that autograph seekers can be a pain.

Woods sprained his left knee leaving the 18th green after a practice round when he collided with an overzealous autograph seeker. Woods received treatment, but he was walking with a limp, and he would not guarantee he would be ready for the first round of the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am Thursday.

Pressed on whether he would play Thursday, Woods said he would not make a final decision until he saw how he felt Thursday morning.

''Hopefully, I can go tomorrow,'' said Woods, who won the tournament in dramatic fashion last year, coming from seven strokes behind with seven holes to play. ''If I can't rotate and can't let it go, then obviously I can't go. I was walking off the green. A lot of fans just kind of got on top of me. One guy ran right in front, and I stepped on his ankle. My weight going forward, his weight coming toward me, just hyperextended my knee.''
