After seven months of stalemate at the bargaining table, striking elevator constructors in this city have voted to go back to work under a contract only slightly different from the three‐year pacts a dozen other construction crafts accepted many months ago.

The long tie‐up forced 50,000 other building unionists into idleness and caused heavy losses to contractors and prospective tenants in high‐rise office and apartment buildings. One reason the stoppage lasted so long was the outrageous provision in the New York State Unemployment Insurance Law that puts employers in the position of having to help subsidize strikes against themselves.

New York and Rhode Island are alone among the fifty states to permit strikers to draw unemployment insurance benefits; the funds out of which the benefits come are built up exclusively through employer taxes. An estimated $2 million in benefits was paid to strikers during the various stages of the marathon construction stoppage.

This latest evidence of the perversion of unemployment insurance into a spur for union intransigence in collective bargaining ought finally awaken the State Legislature to the need for amending the law to end a strike subsidy that contributes neither to justice nor to industrial peace.
