PATRICIA CLAGHORN originally wanted to call it the Mother of All Job Fairs. She changed her mind.

But Ms. Claghorn, the director of staffing for Trump Hotels, insists that the Reach For Excellence job fair, scheduled for March 31 at the 4,000-seat Etess Arena at the Taj Mahal, will live up to its original title. ''We expect to get at least 3,000 applications out of it, hopefully more,'' she said. ''This is going to be an all-out competitive effort.''

March is employee-hunting season in Atlantic City, with every casino company in town scheduling back-of-the-house tours for high school and college students, recruiting sessions at colleges from Florida to Rhode Island, and ''job shadowing'' sessions, in which applicants follow workers around, eat in employee cafeterias and observe what casino work is really like.

By May, the Atlantic City casino industry, which employs 48,500 full- and part-time workers a year, will need to hire as many as 10,000 new workers for summer seasonal positions and to fill vacancies due to the industry's 40 percent turnover rate.

As the job recruiter for Trump Hotels -- the city's largest employer, with 15,700 workers -- Ms. Claghorn has 4 staff members who do nothing but interview applicants and 10 who do nothing but train new employees. She is vying with other casino companies for a steadily decreasing pool of entry-level workers. Although her office receives 75 unsolicited resumes a day, Ms. Claghorn predicted that 1998 would be the most difficult year so far, with 1,700 vacancies to be filled by the Trump casinos before the summer begins.
