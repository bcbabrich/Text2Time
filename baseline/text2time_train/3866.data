To the outside world, however, the girl in the modest-maiden dresses and modified bowl hairdo had been transformed into a poised and elegant fashion plate whose every style change influenced the way women around the well-dressed world stepped out.

There were frequent reports and just as many denials from Buckingham Palace that the marriage was in trouble and that Charles and Diana were thinking of splitting up. Then, in December 1992, Prime Minister John Major told a packed House of Commons that they had agreed to separate.

The monarchy was faced with its greatest crisis since the abdication in 1936 of Edward VIII, who was forced to give up the crown because of his love for an American divorcee, Wallis Warfield Simpson.

In 1994, Charles took part in a BBC documentary in which he admitted his adultery and dismissed suggestions, allegedly from Diana, that he was not fit to be King. She retaliated in 1995 with an equally bold television interview confessing her own extra-marital relationships, her anger at the royal family, her feeling that she was resented by her husband for attracting more favorable attention than he and her conviction that Charles would not make a good King. There were widespread reports that she wanted to see the crown go directly to her son William, familiarly known as Wills.

The British public has always been more smitten with Diana than with Charles, a figure perceived as remote, cool and unpleasantly eccentric. Her television interview was seen as much more convincing than his, increasing her popularity and putting the British more than ever off the man destined to become their monarch. Just this month a poll said that for the first time, a majority of the public did not believe that Britain needed a monarchy anymore, a feeling only intensified by Diana's estrangement from Buckingham Palace and her seemingly heart-broken televised lament that ''there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.''

Diana gained public sympathy with her admission of ''a feeling of being no good at everything and useless and hopeless and failed in every direction'' and her suggestions that it was Prince Charles and his coterie of male friends who held her up to such ridicule. She unblushingly talked of her humiliating affair with Mr. Hewitt, saying she ''adored'' him and was ''very let down'' by his ending the relationship.

With the divorce, she had to give up being addressed as Her Royal Highness, the honorific that separates the royal family's inner circle from other nobles and aristocrats. But she was able to keep the title Princess of Wales, and she obtained a lump sum payment of $22.5 million and $600,000 a year to maintain her offices. She also got to keep her five-bedroom, four-reception-room apartment at Kensington Palace. Maybe most important, she gained equal access with Prince Charles to her two children.
