Colorado traded outfielder Todd Hollandsworth and the left-hander Dennys Reyes to Texas for outfielder Gabe Kapler and the prospect Jason Romano, an infielder and outfielder.

In a trade between noncontenders, Pittsburgh sent outfielder Chad Hermansen to the Cubs for outfielder Darren Lewis.

On Tuesday, Phillips put the odds of making a trade as even, but he worked feverishly to tilt things in his favor. The Mets were still involved in discussions with the Giants for starter Liván Hernández, who would have been a more significant acquisition than Thomson. But the Giants never made a firm offer. The Giants inquired about reacquiring Shawn Estes, but the Mets would have had to pay for some of the remainder of his $6.2 million salary this season.

The Mets spoke with the Expos about Cliff Floyd, although they were unwilling to trade the prospects Aaron Heilman and Jose Reyes for him. Floyd went to Boston. The Mets spoke to the Tigers about outfielder Robert Fick, in another prospect-laden deal.

But Phillips was unable to add an outfielder and ''we needed to get pitching,'' he said. Phillips focused on Thomson, another pitcher with a live arm whose career has been set back by injuries and by the hitter-friendly Coors Field. Thomson, 28, has been on the disabled list four times in his career, once for a blister on his right middle finger and three times for shoulder injuries. He missed all of the 2000 season after having surgery to repair a torn labrum and was twice sidelined upon his return last season.

Thomson is 7-8 with a 4.88 earned run average in 21 starts this season. Pedro Astacio, who learned to pitch at Coors Field, has been one of the Mets' best starters this season, and Phillips said he hoped Thomson would thrive after leaving Colorado. But Thomson has actually pitched better at home (4.50 E.R.A.) than on the road (5.94 E.R.A.) this season.

Thomson will make his Mets debut in D'Amico's spot on Sunday. D'Amico will go to the bullpen, where he has one career appearance in 95 major league games.
