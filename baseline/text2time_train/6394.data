TUNIS, June 1 — Tunisia gave a tumultuous welcome to day to President Habib Bout guiba on his return after six months absence in France for health reasons.

Tens of thousands of people, some brought from remote parts of the country, lined the 10‐mile route from Carthage airport through the center of Tunis, where a 70‐foot‐high picture of Mr. Bourguiba had been put up.

In a statement to the press, Mr. Bourguiba expressed the conviction that his popularity had not diminished in the 14 years since he took power “in spite of what the people have gone through” during his ab sence. This was an apparent reference to chaos caused by recent attempts to collectivize the country's agrarian econ omy, a policy that has been abandoned.

The 66‐year‐old President left Tunisia for France on Nov. 17 for extended medical treat ment following a severe attack of hepatitis.
