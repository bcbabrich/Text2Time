PPL agreed late Tuesday to buy the British electrical grid business of Germany’s E.ON for about $5.6 billion in cash, significantly expanding its operations in that country.

Through the deal for the business, Central Networks, PPL will run Britain’s largest network of electricity delivery companies, with what it said was a regulatory asset value of $7.8 billion. As part of the transaction, PPL will also assume $800 million of the unit’s debt.

PPL said it expected the deal — scheduled to close in April — to help its bottom line, adding to its earnings per share by 10 cents to 15 cents this year, and up to 32 cents to 38 cents in two years.

“Opportunities as compelling as this do not come along very often,” James H. Miller, PPL’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. “Since customers will also benefit from our operational capability, this truly is a win-win transaction.”

The purchase isn’t the first time the two companies have done business. Last year, E.ON sold its Midwestern operations, comprising two Kentucky utilities, to PPL for $7.6 billion.

PPL was advised by Credit Suisse, Bank of America and the law firms Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, Allen & Overy and Ashurst.
