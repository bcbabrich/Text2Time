Mr. Warren-Boulton acknowledged the narrow point but noted that most of the contracts called for the Internet access companies to guarantee that 75 percent or more of their customers use Microsoft's browser.

Mr. Lacovara countered by asking whether such exclusive, cross-promotional deals were standard in many industries. ''Absent monopoly power,'' Mr. Warren-Boulton replied in a pointed return to his theme that the antitrust rules are different for monopolies, ''exclusive-dealing arrangements can be assumed to be benign.''

In the morning session, Mr. Lacovara offered evidence that several large computer manufacturers, including Hewlett-Packard, now ship their personal computers with their own hybrid Web browser installed. Was that not an indication, Mr. Lacovara asked, that Microsoft was not restricting manufacturers nearly as much as Mr. Warren-Boulton and the Government have contended?

Not really, Mr. Warren-Boulton responded. The Hewlett-Packard browser, like others, is really just a ''shell'' -- a custom-made user interface behind which lies the code for Microsoft's browser, Internet Explorer, he said.

''This works for Microsoft,'' Mr. Warren-Boulton said, ''because it increases the installed base for Internet Explorer'' and prompts developers to write complementary software.

After a couple of years of enforcing contracts that limited the freedom of computer makers to offer the Internet software from rivals, Microsoft loosened the contracts earlier this year, mostly with the introduction of Windows 98, an upgrade of its operating system introduced in June.

Similarly, Microsoft relaxed some contract restrictions on Internet service suppliers early this year. By then, Mr. Warren-Boulton said, ''the game was over'' in terms of tipping key channels of software distribution in Microsoft's favor. The easing of contract restrictions also came after the Justice Department's high-profile investigation of Microsoft was well under way and the company faced Senate hearings and a Government challenge in a separate case.
