The art of advertising, which people call obvious and shameless, has actually become impenetrable.

Since YouTube, advertising is now way, way, way more impenetrable than, say, Noh theater or “Finnegans Wake.”

Explain, seriously, why a company pays $2.6 million for a 30-second spot during the Superbowl — right when people are going for more beer or chips or, even if they’re studying the ad for artfulness, not converting to the brand — only to leak it all over the Internet before its big kickoff on Sunday?

Is this cost-effective? Stuart Elliott enlightens us here. And, O.K., maybe the Web exposure is worth more than holding the ad back for a Hollywood-style premiere.

But maybe when you’ve seen 87 versions of an ad on YouTube (check out, for example, Kevin Federline for Nationwide) and then it appears in the living room on the bigger screen, all dialed to that hideous “sports” coloration, you just don’t care. It’s all played out. The ad — which is one of those with a big, broad reveal, after all — is like a spent joke.

For its part, Nationwide is busy telling and retelling its joke on its OWN SITE.

I just want to hear from one person who signs up for Nationwide insurance, believing it to be on his or her side, having seen Federline fantasize about hip-hop stardom.
