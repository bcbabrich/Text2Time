After growing for more than 300 years, kiidk'yaas was felled one cold night in January. A 48-year-old drifter who objected to ''freaks'' and ''university-trained professionals'' took responsibility in a letter and has been arrested.

When the elders called the Haida together, they cried. ''They felt really responsible for what happened,'' Mr. Guujaaw said. ''They were supposed to be looking after the tree and they failed.''

The elders were also burdened by a fear that perhaps the old prophecy would be fulfilled and that this generation of Haida would be the last to admire the golden spruce.

In Vancouver, Mr. Macdonald's staff was busy checking the collection notes of the Botanical Garden to verify that their golden spruce specimen was indeed the living embodiment of the one that had been cut down. They found that in 1977, Mr. Macdonald's predecessor, Roy Taylor, had gone with a group of foresters to the Queen Charlottes and clipped a few branches of the golden spruce in order to graft them. The spruce stood on land that has been leased to MacMillan Bloedel, Canada's largest forestry company.

The clippings were brought to a specialized nursery, where, using an old method of propagation, they were joined to a branch of a living Sitka spruce, albeit one without the special mutation to make it golden. The branch was then bent so that part could be placed in soil, where after about nine months it sent down roots.

Two new seedlings were tended in a nursery for about five years and then transplanted to a forested section of the Botanical Gardens. Two years ago the trees, then about five feet tall, were placed near a quiet stretch of the Botanical Garden path.

When he read about what the golden spruce meant to the Haida, Mr. Macdonald called the island and offered to transplant the two spruces he had. Still thinking as a scientist, he was taken aback when the Haida said they they were uneasy because they thought that the branches used for the graft had been taken surreptitiously. And they weren't sure if the graft meant that the seedlings were truly the same tree.
