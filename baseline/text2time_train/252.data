Rescue teams are continuing to assess the scale of the destruction after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake and the resulting tsunami struck the large Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday, leaving more than 1,200 dead, thousand of buildings destroyed and over 61,000 people displaced.

Views of the Damage

Palu, a city of about 380,000, saw extensive damage from the earthquake and tsunami. This is a bridge that spanned the mouth of the Palu River before the disaster:

Here’s the same bridge after the tsunami:

The damage caused by the disaster was broader, though, than what can be seen in a photograph. Images from the satellite company Planet, taken three days after the earthquake, show the wider effects of the disaster.

The images show sediment spilling out of Palu River and into the bay. You can also see the collapsed yellow bridge from the photos above lying over the mouth of the river in the “after” image below.

On the eastern side of the bay, you can see where the waves scoured the beachfront, reducing buildings to rubble in many places.

The images also show neighborhoods south of Palu’s airport devastated by the effect of liquefaction, which causes soil to lose its ability to support structures.

A more detailed image, from the satellite imagery company Airbus, shows a closer view of the damage. North is to the left in this image, because it was taken from a different angle than the ones above.

Potential Wave Heights

Waves from the tsunami reached as high as 20 feet. A computer model by Andreas Schäfer, a geophysicist from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, showed the waves growing larger as they entered the bay. That model, however, may not show precise wave heights because it was developed using a different, though, similar fault.
