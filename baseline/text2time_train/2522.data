In fact, at a recent holiday party soon after the renovation, Ms. Gund ushered in guests to see not the reborn kitchen, but a video playing a continuous loop. The work, ''Dicing Nature,'' opens with a scene of the empty kitchen with a vase of flowers in one corner. Then Mr. Shapiro's nephew, Bryan Calvert, a chef who owns Cafe Atlas on Central Park South, appears and slices up a grapefruit. In the next scene, a waterfall gushes from a ceiling vent, gradually filling the room with water. A couple of fish swim by. ''It's about the displacement of nature, the interaction between the use of food and nature, and our perception of nature,'' Mr. Dochantschi said, taking a stab at clarifying the plot.

At the party, for the Museum of Modern Art's membership committee, guests were riveted, especially by a vase of purple and white orchids on a bookshelf captured by a discreetly placed camera and inserted into the video. ''You can't tell what's real and what's been filmed before,'' said Neal Meltzer, an art consultant, while watching a scene showing the Cornue stove and the flowers dissolving into clouds in a blue sky. ''It's a little like a Magritte.'' As the party wound down, guests began turning the camera on themselves so that they too appeared in the video as the kitchen flooded.

Considering that people are spending more and more time in the kitchen, it was probably inevitable that art would find its way there as well, said Glenn D. Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art. The idea that it could be ''not just a place to cook and chat over a meal but actually a place for thinking about art was brilliant,'' he said.

It took three months to make the video -- almost as long as the renovation -- using software by Peter Flaherty, a video artist who worked on ''Alladeen,'' a mixed-media presentation at the Brooklyn Academy of Music last month. The jazziest aspect of the Gund-Shapiro video is the projection of a live image -- at the party, it was the orchids -- into the recorded clip. As it turned out, buying fish at the fish market in Chinatown and keeping them alive was almost as difficult.

The 20-minute video was included in the budget for the project. (Mr. Dochantschi and his clients declined to discuss how much was spent, except to say that it was about the same as for an off-the-shelf kitchen from a high-end European company.) Ms. Gund said that at first she was skeptical about the video, ''but when Markus explained it better, as being about the difference between what you think you're eating and what you really eat, I thought it was such a fun idea.'' The flat-screen monitor, positioned next to the table, also serves as a computer, a DVD player and a television set.

The Gund-Shapiro kitchen is Mr. Dochantschi's first. The only other project he has completed in the United States is the renovation of a town house in Greenwich Village for Hyatt Bass, a daughter of Sid and Anne Bass, and her husband, Josh Klausner. He approached the 400-square-foot kitchen with the intensity of a young architect with ideas to burn and much to prove. Today's kitchen is highly complex and layered, he said, like a Joseph Cornell box.

''It has to work on contradictory levels,'' he said, ''as a professional space for entertaining, a normal home kitchen and an extension of the living room.''
