Deborah Franklin's article raises some interesting questions. She cites numerous instances in which there is evidence that heredity dictates the traits of individuals - including quite minor traits - but she reports that on such fundamental issues as a person's ''niceness'' or the tendency to ''criminality'' heredity does not seem very important. This would seem to call into question many of her subtler findings. WILLIAM E. STONEMAN Belmont, Mass.
