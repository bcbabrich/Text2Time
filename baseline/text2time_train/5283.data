To the Editor:

If George Bush thinks, as your June 10 news story about the Massachusetts drug plan of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis says, that the death penalty will deter big-league drug dealers, we must conclude he is as out of touch with reality as his boss.

The death penalty already exists in the world of drugs, and it is executed more swiftly and more certainly than any death penalty sought in the courtroom and exacted years later, if ever. Drug users know that death is an occupational hazard. They recognize the immediate risk of overdoses and contaminated drugs, of the future risk of AIDS. Drug pushers know that part of the overhead is violent death, often their own. How many drug dealers - large and small - are murdered every year? Thousands? More drug-related murders occur every week in this country than legal executions in a year, maybe in a decade.

The fear of the death penalty has not deterred those who kill a candy-store owner for a couple of dollars. How can anyone think the death penalty will deter drug dealers from pursuing hundreds of thousands, millions of dollars? But why should we be surprised at such a suggestion from an Administration that thinks it can do something about drug trafficking by packing off Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, one of the biggest of all drug dealers, to a quiet vacation in Spain? JOSEPH M. WILLIAMS Chicago, June 17, 1988
