Eugene Loring, the dancer and choreographer who created ''Billy the Kid,'' an American ballet classic, died Monday in Kingston, N.Y., after a long illness. He was 72 years old.

Mr. Loring danced with leading American ballet companies, appeared on the Broadway stage, taught and continued to choreograph throughout his life. But it was for ''Billy the Kid,'' one of the earliest and best works of the folklore genre in modern American ballet, that Mr. Loring was best known.

The one-act ballet was set to music by Aaron Copland. Its libretto by Lincoln Kirstein was based on the legendary outlaw, William Bonney, alias Billy the Kid. The ballet was performed for the first time in 1938 by Ballet Caravan, with Mr. Loring in the title role. Three years later it entered the repertory of American Ballet Theater and was revived last spring by that company.

A sympathetic look at the making of a criminal, ''Billy the Kid'' unfolds in stark, stylized processionals and confrontations that have the flavor of western novels, movies and comic strips. Professional Dancing in '34
