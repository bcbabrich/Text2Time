PHILADELPHIA — Henry Blanco has caught Mike Pelfrey’s last five starts, and the combination has mostly worked well, but Manager Jerry Manuel said he would like to mix it up a little bit and have Rod Barajas catch Pelfrey soon. Manuel said this before Pelfrey gave up six runs in four innings, so it had nothing to do with Pelfrey’s performance against the Phillies.

Manuel said the change would have come Saturday if it had been a night game. But it was a day game following a night game that Barajas caught, so Manuel wanted to give him a rest, even though Barajas hit two home runs and a double and knocked in three runs Friday night.

He also has six home runs in his last seven games at Citizens Bank Park since leaving the Phillies after the 2007 season.

Blanco had one of the Mets’ three hits off Roy Halladay on Saturday, a double in the third inning. He was sacrificed to third but was stranded there after Angel Pagan drilled a line drive up the middle that was caught by Chase Utley at second.

Some other interesting tidbits that came out of Saturday’s game:

¶Jason Bay singled in the second inning to extend his hitting streak to eight games.

¶Roy Halladay has five complete games in his last eight starts dating to last season with the Blue Jays.

¶With 45,264 people in attendance, Citizens Bank Park was sold out for its 50th consecutive regular-season game.
