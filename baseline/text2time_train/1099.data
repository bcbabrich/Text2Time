DES MOINES — Mitt Romney is fighting to be the top choice of Republicans here in Iowa, but he’s already the top target for Democrats.

On Sunday night, just as polling showed Mr. Romney leading the GOP field along with Ron Paul, Democratic Party operatives descended on Iowa to set up an anti-Romney war room at a hotel in downtown Des Moines. There, they introduced a worker laid off in the early 1990s when his Indiana employer was bought by Mr. Romney’s private equity firm, Bain Capital.

“I really feel he didn’t care about the worker,” said the employee, Randy Johnson, who was flown in for the news conference by the Democratic National Committee. “It was all about profit before people.”

His appearance was a preview of a Democratic general election strategy – attacking Mr. Romney’s time as a wealthy buyout specialist — that will no doubt be used repeatedly if he becomes the Republican nominee.

But more than anything, perhaps, the news conference was an elaborate show of force against Mr. Romney by Democrats eager to put him on notice that they will not wait until after the primaries to undercut his message of job creation and financial know-how. (The room where Mr. Johnson spoke featured a staff of five D.N.C. aides, a bank of flat-screen televisions, and giant jugs of coffee.)

Mr. Johnson, now a union activist who worked at American Pad & Paper in the 1990s, described how under Bain Capital’s stewardship, the company laid off dozens of workers at the Indiana plant. Bain Capital made tens of millions of dollars from its investment in the paper manufacturer, which eventually filed for bankruptcy.

“I think he is out of touch with the average person,” Mr. Johnson said.

Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney’s campaign, dismissed the Democratic critique, saying “President Obama and his cronies know that if they have to face Mitt Romney in the general election they are going to lose, which is why they continue their ‘kill Romney’ strategy.”

In the past, Mr. Romney has said that while Bain’s investments had created thousands of jobs, they occasionally required tough medicine, including layoffs, to fix troubled companies.

Bain’s investment in American Pad & Paper became a potent issue in his 1994 campaign against Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who put laid-off workers from the company in television commercials that sought to portray Mr. Romney as a robber baron. Mr. Romney lost that race by a wide margin.

Mr. Johnson suggested he would retell the story of his layoff across Iowa and anywhere else where Mr. Romney campaigned for president.

“I have asked the D.N.C. to help me figure out where to go,” he said.
