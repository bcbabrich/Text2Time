Ratesh Chopra, whose fledgling tea company is rooted in Brooklyn, describes it as a “passion project.” Dissatisfied with how tea is often an afterthought where coffee is served, he decided to start his own company. By trial and error, he now has a growing inventory sold online and, increasingly, in local shops. He has eight varieties available online, including the black Brooklyn Breakfast, the well-balanced Moroccan Mint and some for making iced tea, with more to come. The teas are full leaf and come in silky sachets. I’m already hooked on the eye-opening Ginger & Turmeric, at once soothing and bold. Prices start at $12 for 15 tea bags: bushwicktea.com.
