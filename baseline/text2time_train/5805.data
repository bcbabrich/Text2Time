But very quickly the Paines outgrew 50. Four years ago Josh was born; two years later Daniel came along.

Mr. Paine often worked the night shift at Eastman Kodak, and he found that trying to sleep during the day in the small house was an art. In winter, with everyone cooped up, the hallway outside Mr. Paine's door sounded like the New Jersey Turnpike. ''The house had a real bad traffic pattern,'' said Mrs. Paine. ''The kids were up and down the hall constantly.''

Last May, Mrs. Paine put a note in Mrs. Hoffman's mailbox suggesting a possible switch. Because no real-estate fees were involved, they could sell below the market price. The Hoffmans sold the bigger house for $67,000, though it was appraised at $80,000; the Paines sold the smaller house for $53,000, though the appraisal was $65,000.

The larger house at 48 is just what the Paines needed. ''We can't get over having three bathrooms,'' Mrs. Paine said. For a while Josh, the 4-year-old, could find only two of them.

Mr. and Mrs. Paine have done a lot already, including pulling up carpeting in the family room, putting in new storm doors and painting the boys' rooms. They plan much more. Their new home is so much bigger; they don't even have furniture for the dining room yet.

''But for the Hoffmans, it was not quite as exciting as for us,'' said Mrs. Paine, 26. ''To settle for a smaller house, it's discouraging.''

Mrs. Hoffman, 41, could not afford 48 any more. In December 1983 she was divorced. The judge gave her 18 months either to buy out her ex-husband or sell the big house and split the profit.
