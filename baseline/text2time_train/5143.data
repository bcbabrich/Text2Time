Bistro d'Adrienne

Sometimes there is no accounting for public taste. When the Bistro d'Adrienne was part of the French-run Hotel Maxim's de Paris, the food was very good and the room had class - yet the place was empty. Now, under the Peninsula Hotel Group, the food is still very good but the room has no class - and the place is full.

The hotel still has two restaurants on the second floor. The maitre d'hotel who greeted us explained the approach of each: ''On that side,'' he said, pointing to the larger room, ''it's classic . . . you know, heavy French food. On this side is a bistro: sandwiches, salads and that kind of stuff.'' We chose the bistro.

The menu is appealing and, considering the locale, not unreasonably priced. We waited 20 minutes at the bar even though two tables were empty and awaiting silverware. When finally seated, we remained waterless, breadless and menuless for another 10 minutes. Our waiter could have been an understudy on ''Fawlty Towers.'' When we ordered, his standard reply was ''Huh?'' We resorted to pointing at the menu - one veloute of red peppers ($6), one oxtail terrine ($7.50) - and he scribbled. Then he served us two consommes. ''I asked for oxtail terrine,'' I said. ''Yes, one oxtail,'' he replied. ''And that isn't tomato veloute,'' I added. ''Yes, tomato veloute,'' he declared confidently.

Another waiter came to the rescue. When the correct dishes arrived, they were attractive and well seasoned. So too were entrees of poached fresh cod fillet rolled around a ripe tomato salad, all in a sparkling broth with turned vegetables and aioli ($16.50); and a light, herby navarin of lamb ($18.50).
