** ?? The Griffin, 313 East 46th Street, 371–4542.

In this year of folding restaurants, it is almost an act of perversity to open a serious new place in the high rent district. The Griffin, however, is off and running—and running well. It is nicely decorated with modem paintings, attractive though not museum pieces. Its staff function smoothly, as if they had been working together for a long time. The owner is on the premises, always a good sign. And the essentially French menu is quite well done, within its limits.

The chilled salmon mousse has a fine texture and comes in a dill sauce. The quiche has an especially flaky crust (no butter was spared here). And the soups change daily, from one classic variety to another. One, for example, is potage Parmentier, a purée of leeks and potatoes.

For main courses, the chicken. Gismonda was notably elegant. It consists of boneless chicken breasts on a bed of spinach in a rich sauce. Shrimp Capri is also impressively flavorful. The shrimp are cut so as to form a butterfly shape, and their tomato sauce is well spiced.
