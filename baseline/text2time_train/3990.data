Nor, I think, can the success of "Twister" be explained by the hard-sell techniques -- some call it synergy -- of modern media conglomerates. While Time Warner, whose Warner Brothers co-produced the movie, also publishes two magazines, Time and Entertainment Weekly, that heralded "Twister" with tie-in covers, the film has continued to draw colossal crowds week after week, even holding its own against the formidable competition of Tom Cruise's biceps. People just can't get enough of a weatherman who gets so turned on by chasing tornadoes that he's willing to ditch his fiancee if she insists on standing between him and his Doppler radar.

Americans and weathermen -- this truly was, until "Twister," the love that dare not speak its name. But the romance has been bubbling to the surface more and more feverishly in recent years, and not just on that cable outlet for hard-core meteorological porn, the Weather Channel. Weathermen, once merely an adjunct to the morning network news shows, are now their ubiquitous court jesters -- with each network competing to cast the role with the most Falstaffian possible combination of mirth and girth. And as the network weathermen get us out of bed, so another, local crew, sometimes slimmer and sometimes female, tucks us in each night: the weather report is often held back to the very end of the 11 o'clock news, as if it were an irresistible bedtime story.

No matter how high-tech the equipment surrounding these weathermen, local or network, their predictions are no more foolproof than they were back in the stone age before Doppler, Stormwatch and wind-chill factor. But that's precisely how we like it. In "Twister," when the camera actually enters a tornado, we hear a heavenly choir; a line of dialogue has already announced we are in the presence of the apocalyptic "thunder of God." The more inaccurate the weather report in the face of increased scientific expertise, the more we can be reassured that there are still some things science can't control, no matter how advanced our knowledge. America is the most religious country in the world as measured by church attendance, and accurate weather reports could set off the worst crisis of faith since Tammy Faye Bakker was stripped of her eyelashes.

If "Twister 2" is going to surpass "Twister," however, they should dump that square-jawed weatherman and give the audience what it really wants in a meteorological matinee idol: Al Roker.

Defense of Marriage Act Redux: Last week in this space I incorrectly stated that the wife Bob Dole divorced after 24 years of marriage was his nurse, when in fact she was an occupational therapist he met as he was leaving the hospital. Nor is she to be confused with the second Mrs. Dole, who is also no nurse, despite her considerable service to the American Red Cross.
