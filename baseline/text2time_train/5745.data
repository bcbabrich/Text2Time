They rented Lake Placid Airport, which has been shut all week, and converted it into a village three times as big as Lake Placid itself. They created their own bus system and a well-organized parking grid, placing the trailers of club officers at the front of the camp.

Several Lake Placid officials said the trailer club might be the nicest, best-behaved group of 9,000 ever to vacation here. These are people brimming over with old-fashioned values. When club members mentioned the Wally Byam Usherettes, they usually added, ''those lovely ladies,'' and when they spoke of the band, they called it, ''our very own Wally Byam band.''

''I have never met a nicer bunch,'' said Matthew Clark, the Supervisor of the Town of North Elba.

They have no religious slant or political philosophy. ''The only cause might be if some injustice was being done to recreational vehicles,'' said Lou van Dyck, a retired public relations officer for the State of New York and the club spokesman.

''We hate when people call us Byamites,'' said Frank Sargent, a club member for 27 years. ''We're not a cult or anything.''

They hate when people say they are snobby. ''Tent campers seem to think Airstreamers, like the Cabots and Lodges, only speak to God,'' Mr. van Dyck said, ''so we work hard speaking to everyone.''

A 100-Member Police Force

Jim Creel, a retired teacher who heads the unarmed, 100-member, all-volunteer, Wally Byam police force, said he never heard of a participant at a major rally being arrested. A big problem, he said, is old people getting sick at rallies. Eight men who signed up to be members of the force had to cancel. ''It was mostly heart problems or falls,'' Mr. Creel said.

Club members are, in plain words, people who like to drive to new places in trailers, park a while, renew old friendships and meet new people who like doing the exact same thing.
