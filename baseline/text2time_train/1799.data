NEW ORLEANS — After a day of watching bowl games, it’s nice to get settled in the press box here at the Superdome. Players are milling around on the field during pregame warm ups. The Georgia fans just roared in approval as some of their players ran onto the field.

Georgia Coach Mark Richt called for the fans to wear all black, the same color of the uniforms Georgia will be wearing, and it appears that most have responded. The Hawaii fans are dressed in white and are settled into their seats. The assembled media members are anxious to see the Ha’a, the version of the haka dance that the Warriors do prior to every game. They were flagged for it in Ruston, La., earlier in the year when they performed it before a game against Louisiana Tech.

The big question in the press box before the game is if the Warriors can hang around. W.A.C. Commissioner Karl Benson said that he hoped it would be a game in the fourth quarter. The Warriors have been a great story. Do you think that they can hang around tonight?
