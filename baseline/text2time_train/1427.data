FRIDAY’S PUZZLE — The comedian Emo Philips once did a bit about using chocolate Easter bunnies as a diagnostic tool in psychotherapy. I don’t remember exactly how it went, but to paraphrase, he was told that the first part he bit off would clue the therapist in to where his problem lies: if he bit off the ears first, for example, it meant that he was relatively normal; if he bit off the feet first, it meant he felt he wasn’t getting anywhere in life. His reply: “What if I bite out the eyes and scream ‘Stop staring at me!‘?”

The middle entry at 32 Across reminded me of that joke. “Earful for getting an eyeful” is a very clever clue for DON’T STARE.

There’s more to be mined here, wordplay-wise. “Pieces of eight?” made me laugh when I finally realized that Ed Sessa was thinking about musical pieces (OCTETS), not pirates’ booty, and I thought that TOWN was a great answer to the misdirecting “Hamlet’s cousin.”

I messed up slightly at the 46 Across/40 Down because I confidently filled in BENEFIT instead of BENEFIC, which left me flummoxed as to what course might use a fridge (the answer is HOME EC). At first, I wasn’t quite sure who uses BUGLES for mating calls, but I am told that the bugler, in this case, is the mighty bull moose

Thanks to Mr. Sessa for throwing a Monty Python reference into the grid at 24 Down, but since I am in a T.G.I.F. mood, I’d like to dance out with some music from the “Ones who might get you into hot water?” (a brilliant clue):
