WASHINGTON, Oct. 31—The United States Supreme Court left standing today a ruling that the New Jersey state police cannot be barred from stopping longhaired drivers on the state's highways and searching their cars for what plaintiffs said was “the hope of finding marijuana or other illicit drues.”

Dividing 7 to 2, the justices declined to accept for review a decision in which a lower court, while accusing the Jersey troopers of “callous indifference” to the rights of travelers, said it was powerless to correct the situation because of a 1976 Supreme Court ruling.

Associate Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall voted to hear arguments in the case, saying in a short dissenting opinion that the case for explaining the earlier ruling in the light of the New Jersey situation was “compelling.”

The High Court does not agree to review a lower‐court decision unless four of the nine justices vote to do so. It reexamines only about 5 percent of all’ the cases in which the losing parties ask for another hearing.
