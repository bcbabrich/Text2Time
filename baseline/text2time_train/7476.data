WASHINGTON, July 31 (AP) — The Citizens Foreign Aid Committee, which regards most overseas spending as an unnecessary “giveaway,” criticized President Johnson's $3.5 billion foreign aid program today.

Its spokesmen. including Brig. Gen. Bonner FeIles, retired, said that if the war in South Vietnam was to be pressed to a successful conclusion, $1 billion in military assistance might be required.

They also argued that there was an unliquidated balance in foreign aid funds left over from prior years, and that Congress need not appropriate any new funds for the current fiscal year.

General Fellers, national chairman of the committee; Walter Harnischfeger, Milwaukee manufacturer, who is its honorary chairman; Elgin Groseclose, Washington financial and investment consultant, and Dr. Lewis E. Lloyd of Midland, Mich., an economist, testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee.
