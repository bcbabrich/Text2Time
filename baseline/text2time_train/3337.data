The ''Shorts Stop'' segments, which begin this Sunday, aim to show that music videos are related to the rock documentary, at least in spirit. So these programs feature the work of independent filmmakers -- including Mr. Moore, despite his antivideo stance -- who have crossed over in both directions.

The series host, Mark Anthony Thompson, talks loftily about ''the cross-pollination of music and cinema'' -- at least as lofty as a man can be slouching on a couch and wearing sunglasses (indoors) and orange flip-flops. But the series proves mainly that interesting imagery distracts from good music and can't elevate lousy music, and that annoying pictures can actually prove deafening. You simply tune out.

The best work in the series comes, not surprisingly, from Spike Jonze, who sprang exuberantly from the video world into film, with the inventive ''Being John Malkovich'' (and more recently into the world of politics, with his biographical documentary of Al Gore for the Democratic convention). His ''Oh So Quiet'' music video for the Icelandic pop star Bjork, set in a Goodyear tire store, is an extravagantly produced homage to Hollywood musicals of the 1930's. Bjork gleefully high-kicks and prances in an orange dress, looking happy to be in this bright, amusing little spectacle, where the music and pictures actually seem to have something to do with one another (even if they don't).

Another film director, Hal Hartley, has created an amusing mock concert for the English folk singer Beth Orton's ''Stolen Car.'' While singing, Ms. Orton slyly assumes ''meaningful'' poses in various corners of a room, flops on a couch and pretends not to notice the expressionless assistants sticking microphones in front of her mouth. She pricks her finger with the thorn of a rose and a drop of her blood lazily drifts through a glass of water. Mr. Hartley has artfully staged the video in grays and reds, but I'd still rather listen to Ms. Orton's lovely voice with my eyes closed.

As for the pugnacious Mr. Moore, director (of ''Roger and Me'') and television crusader (on ''The Awful Truth'' and ''TV Nation''), he paired up with a band that could have been named just for him, Rage Against the Machine. Mr. Moore has styled his video as just another of his impromptu assaults -- this one on the New York Stock Exchange. As Rage wails outside the exchange, the police arrive. Mr. Moore confronts. The action is intercut with a parody of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' No daisy fields, that's for sure.
