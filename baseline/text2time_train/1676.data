I’ve officially enrolled at Rutgers University, though as I mentioned in my last post I could get news to change my decision as late as July.

In response to some of the comments on my last post I wanted to reiterate one point: while I had my disappointments with my decision being largely dictated by finances, I am happy with my choice and do not at all, as one comment implied, feel superior to other Rutgers students.

I’ve visited and met many smart and motivated students and would be happy to join them. I also wanted to clarify that while Princeton and other Ivies do pledge to cover full need, so does Vassar. Even so, because of my specific financial situation (parents income is eligible, but they are asset-heavy due to being close to retirement) my need-based aid was lacking there, and would probably be similar at the Ivies. I’ll have to see, if the time comes.

For juniors applying to college now, I’d suggest clearly discussing financial situations. I wasn’t completely aware of what my family could afford until late in the process. I’d suggest checking an EFC (Expected Family Contribution) Calculator. Colleges that pledge to cover need base this on your EFC; if it’s high, and you still need money, you might want to apply to schools that offer large merit scholarships (like Rutgers).

Also, remember that not all schools pledge to cover all need. Schools like N.Y.U. grant as much aid as they see fit, but it probably won’t cover everything. Also, grades play into merit aid, so if they’re lacking, apply to schools that give aid based on need. Where you’ll get the most money depends on your personal circumstances. If you know you won’t have enough money, try for private scholarships to make it work.

One thing I was really happy about in my college process was the wide range of schools I applied to. I applied to many schools, so I was able to really look into all their programs and see what I liked. Moreover, all the schools I applied to in the first place were places I could see myself going and enjoying, so when the decision ended up being mainly financially based, I wasn’t extremely disappointed.

I’d like to wish all those applying to college next year good luck in the process, and to everyone finishing the process as I am — we did it, we are officially the college class of 2013.
