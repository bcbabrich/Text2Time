The Nets came back to Indiana with the luxury of a one-game lead and two games remaining to seize their first-round playoff series. That luxury is now stripped to bare necessity.

Playing to save their season and stealing the confident edge away from their visitors, Indiana buried the Nets with a 97-74 victory at raucous Conseco Fieldhouse to force Game 5 at 7 p.m. Thursday at Continental Arena.

''Our guys basically took the night off,'' Nets Coach Byron Scott said. ''I thought we played like we were a team with a cushion. They came out very aggressive, like a team should when their backs are against the wall, and we never responded.''

The Nets will have to respond if they want to win their first playoff series since 1984.

The game unraveled shortly after Jason Kidd made his first 3-pointer. He missed his next seven shots. After averaging 23 points to lead the Nets in scoring in the first three games, Kidd scored 10 points and missed 11 of 15 shots.
