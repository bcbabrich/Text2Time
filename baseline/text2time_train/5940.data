The United States Steel Corporation said it had sold an 81 percent interest in its 64-story headquarters building here for $200 million and expects to sell the remaining interest by December. The purchaser was the California Public Employees Retirees System.

David M. Roderick, U.S. Steel's chairman, said the building would remain the United States Steel Building and the company would continue to maintain its world headquarters here.

The sale was seen as a move by the No.1 steelmaker to generate cash to pay for its $6.2 billion acquisition of the Marathon Oil Company. U.S. Steel had announced in July that it planned to raise $500 million to $750 million this year and a similar amount next year through the sale of assets.
