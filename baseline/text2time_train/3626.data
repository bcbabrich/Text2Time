To the Editor:

When Brent Staples (Editorial Observer, March 29) describes students in a San Francisco school as ''almost 90 percent minority,'' he reveals the absurdity of both our terms for and ways of thinking about cultural diversity in the United States.

In conventional use, ''minority'' refers to the smaller of two groups. In the past it may have been accurate to describe nonwhite, non-northern and non-Western Europeans as a numerical minority. Today, the sheer plurality of national origins and skin colors in the United States ought to show us how inadequate our dualistic conception is. Maybe it's time for a new paradigm.
