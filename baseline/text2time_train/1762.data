Michel Euler/Associated Press Michel Euler/Associated Press Marina Zenovich, the director of the HBO documentary “Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired,” said Thursday that she was “perplexed by the timing” of remarks by David Wells, a former deputy district attorney who said in her film that he had coached the judge presiding over Mr. Polanski’s 1978 trial, but who now says he made it all up.

In a statement, Ms. Zenovich said that since June of 2008, her film “has been quite visible on U.S. television via HBO, in theaters and on DVD, so it is odd that David Wells has not brought this issue to my attention before.”

She added:

“For the record, on the day I filmed Mr. Wells at the Malibu Courthouse, February 11, 2005, he gave me a one-hour interview. He signed a release like all my other interviewees, giving me permission to use his interview in the documentary worldwide. At no time did I tell him that the film would not air in the United States. “Mr. Wells was always friendly and open with me. At no point in the four years since our interview has he ever raised any issues about its content. In fact, in a July 2008 story in The New York Times, Mr. Wells corroborated the account of events that he gave in my film. “I am astonished that he has now changed his story. It is a sad day for documentary filmmakers when something like this happens.”
