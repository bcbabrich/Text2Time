Mr. Goldhagen describes the members of Police Battalion 101, a kind of reserve unit assigned to do police work in the conquered territories, as ordinary German husbands and fathers. They were told by their commanders that they did not have to kill Jews. Still, they entered into a "Dantesque production" of killing, immersing themselves in blood, and inviting their wives and children to watch. It was, Mr. Goldhagen writes, as if humanity had entered "a new moral order."

But their actions, he says, were the result of a German society saturated with anti-Semitism. Even Karl Barth, the Swiss theologian who taught in Germany in the early 30's and became an opponent of Nazism, had "a deep-seated anti-Semitism," Mr. Goldhagen writes. Barth denounced Jews in a 1933 sermon as "an obstinate and evil people," Mr. Goldhagen adds.

"Most anti-Semites just want to get Jews out of the country, but to Germans, Jews were metaphysical enemies," Mr. Goldhagen said in his office. Some Germans protested the killing of Poles, Mr. Goldhagen notes, and of handicapped people, but not of Jews. Even members of the anti-Hitler Resistance were anti-Semitic. Finally, when Heinrich Himmler, chief of the SS, hoping to negotiate with Americans at the end of World War II, forbade the further killing of Jews, some Germans kept on.

In many ways, Mr. Goldhagen's book is a search for answers to unanswerable questions. He is the son of Erich Goldhagen, a survivor of the Romanian-Jewish ghetto in Czernowitz, now in Ukraine. The elder Goldhagen recently retired as a professor from Harvard, where for 25 years he taught a course on the Holocaust. Daniel Goldhagen dedicates his book to his father, his "constant discussion partner."

"My father said almost nothing about his own time," Daniel Goldhagen said. "It was simply very painful. He lost most of his extended family."

Recently, Erich Goldhagen said from Cambridge: "I'm a survivor. I don't like to talk about my experiences for obvious reasons." Yet, he said, "Our house was saturated in the subject." In the Goldhagen household, Daniel Goldhagen said, the Holocaust was not a tale to lament. "The framework was intellectual."

The second oldest of four children, Daniel Goldhagen grew up in Newton, Mass., where he played high school basketball. "I still read the sports page first thing," he said.
