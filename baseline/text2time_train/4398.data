While most Central and Eastern European countries clamor for the swiftest possible admission to the European Union, Norwegians have for the second time rejected an invitation to join. This week's referendum was only an advisory vote, but the Norwegian Parliament, which has the official say, will not defy the electorate's advice.

Norway's voters are not crazy. Their country is indeed a special case -- already a NATO member, rich, well run and with an economic structure that might have made it a net loser from membership in strictly economic terms. Its main export, oil, does not depend on privileged access to European markets. Its well-managed fisheries will now not have to admit Spanish, Portuguese or other E.U. trawlers or accept the suspect custodianship of Brussels fishocrats.

So long as these resources remain plentiful, going it alone makes some economic sense, especially for the rural people who cast most of the no votes. Once those resources start running down, Norway can count on yet another invitation to join.

On the other hand, those working in manufacturing and service businesses could suffer from reduced access to European consumers and investment. That helps explain the strong yes vote in Oslo and Bergen, Norway's main cities. Moreover, all Norwegians may soon come to regret their country's isolation from European political councils at a time when important new security and financial institutions are being shaped.
