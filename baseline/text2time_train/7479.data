PARIS, July 31—Nine youths were arrested last night, charged with neo‐Nazi activities. The roundup was ordered by the Court for the security of the State.

The youths, whose names were not announced, are believed to be members of small groups that profess adherence to the World Union of National Socialists, of which both George Lincoln Rockwell of the United States and Colin Jordan of Britain have claimed leadership.

Right ‐ wing potentially terrorist groups have been under close police surveillance in France since the Algerian dispute nearly rent the nation.
