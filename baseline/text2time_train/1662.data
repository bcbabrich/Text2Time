I’ve received all my decisions, and I’m thrilled to have been admitted to all the schools to which I applied. As perverse as it may sound, this is quite a dilemma itself. From a financial standpoint, for example, my coming from a reasonably well-off family means my offers have been little to nil thus far. Princeton University found me ineligible for need-based aid and I suspect the others will be limited to several thousand dollars at maximum.

This all makes the Morehead-Cain Scholars Program at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill a more compelling option. While I don’t doubt my ability to pay for college with these offers, the debt they incur is substantial and places a significant handicap on graduates. As a full-ride scholarship, the Morehead removes that burden and opens up quite a few possibilities during and after my undergraduate years.

Above all else, though, I don’t want to make my decision based on finances. I have essentially a choice among three environments over the next four years: an Ivy League school; a school like Reed or the University of Chicago; and the Morehead at Chapel Hill. Attending a member of the Ivy League would connect me to a vast number of intelligent, engaged people, not to mention the resources of some extraordinary universities. However, as discussed in one of the articles that shaped my college process, “The Disadvantages of an Elite Education,” I dislike the self-reinforcing superiority that lurks beneath the facade of these schools. The author, William Deresiewicz, writes in The American Scholar,

“As two dozen years at Yale and Columbia have shown me, elite colleges relentlessly encourage their students to flatter themselves for being there, and for what being there can do for them.”

I had a wonderful time visiting Yale in particular last spring and didn’t perceive this overtly, but I’m concerned.

Reed and the University of Chicago may be more overtly intellectual, but an education there has some shortcomings. While these schools are tremendous in their own right, the institutions don’t offer the same flexibility and possibilities for creative, self-directed learning as the Morehead. Universities and college-preparatory programs excel at producing process-oriented students, but very few challenge them to take responsibility for their own learning and initiatives. To me, being an undergraduate entails the assumption of risk, developing imaginative thinking, and taking ownership of one’s work — skills that prepare me to create rather than follow or comply.

I have until April 13th to reply, however, meaning two more difficult weeks to decide.
