''The Autoimmune Connection: Essential Information for Women on Diagnosis, Treatment and Getting on With Your Life,'' by Rita Baron-Faust and Dr. Jill P. Buyon. Contemporary Books, $22.95.

Autoimmune diseases are in an anomalous category that includes more than 80 serious chronic illnesses.

The authors say that more than 50 million Americans, 75 percent of them women, are afflicted with these disorders that seem, on the surface, to have no connection with one another: rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, primary biliary cirrhosis, psoriasis, underactive and overactive thyroid, and lupus, to name a few.

Women are more vulnerable to many of the ailments for a variety of reasons, the authors suggest.

Recent research, they add, says that fetal cells from past pregnancies can survive in the bloodstreams for more than 20 years and may promote an immune response like the rejection of a transplanted organ, perhaps causing diseases like scleroderma, a skin-hardening disorder, and multiple sclerosis.
