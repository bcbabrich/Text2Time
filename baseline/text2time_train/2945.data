To the Editor:

Re ''New Arab Bombing in Israel Deepens a Sense of Dismay'' (front page, May 28):

Peace in the Middle East will remain elusive until Yasir Arafat and the Palestinian Authority stop criticizing suicide bombings only because they are ''harmful to our cause and struggle, and to the image of Palestinian people before international public opinion.'' Instead, they should publicly denounce the intentional targeting of innocent civilians as morally indefensible.
