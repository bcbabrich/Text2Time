Mr. Gore, who had a fatal heart attack in 1986 while hiking, set the policy that no more than 200 people should work under one roof. One day in 1965 when he was walking through his flourishing plant, he realized he no longer knew everyone. From that came the growth strategy to ''get big by staying small.''

''The physical 'feel' of the company's buildings has always been very important to the whole Gore family,'' said Mr. Hill, who started with the Gores 36 years ago in the basement of the Gore home. ''We want our employees to feel good about where they work. We spend more on our cafeterias than we do on our lobbies.''

Gore's president, the 59-year-old Robert W. Gore, the son of the founder, was the creator of the Gore-Tex technology. He often walks the sites, taking an interest in details down to the plantings.

Mr. Hill said the under-200 strategy costs more in terms of land and overhead, since each building must have its own cafeteria, conference room and loading docks. It also requires that each location have a receptionist, a custodial staff and personnel director.

He said the policy probably cost Gore at least 20 percent more for its buildings than would a conventional real estate program. But the gains in efficiency, flexibility and teamwork more than offset the extra expense, Mr. Hill said.

''I think our track record has proven it works,'' he said. ''We really do think of ourselves as a small company.''

As a privately held company, with most of the stock held in a trust set up by the Gores, the company has the flexibility to make decisions based on a longer-term outlook, Mr. Gore said.
