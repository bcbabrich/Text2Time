Eliot Spitzer and leaders of the Legislature reached a compromise that broke a deadlock on a contentious issue that had divided lawmakers for years: setting up procedures to confine sex offenders after they finish their prison sentences, joining more than a dozen other states that have similar laws.

As with the workers compensation overhaul, a compromise had eluded George E. Pataki, Mr. Spitzerâ€™s predecessor.
