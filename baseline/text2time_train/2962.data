From Greenwich to East Hampton, on private helicopter pools ferrying investment bankers into town from Long Island's South Fork and in the steam room of Park Avenue's Racquet Club, the cognoscenti can readily recognize one familiar facet of the tale of Martha Stewart and her friend, the now-former biotechnology chief executive Samuel D. Waksal: they were entwined in a Manhattan grapevine where the exchange of corporate information is a burgeoning social custom, not necessarily a crime.

In Manhattan and its environs, friendships like theirs often coincide with business relationships. And where power, access and social advantage intersect, information that most Americans would think of as exceedingly privileged is passed at cocktail parties and over linen-clad dinner tables as casually as canap√©s.

In the latest case, however, investigators are asking whether a few social figures went over the line. On June 12, Dr. Waksal, then chief executive of ImClone Systems, was arrested on charges of insider trading. Ms. Stewart's actions are being examined in several investigations. She and Dr. Waksal say they did nothing illegal or wrong.

Insider trading is the buying or selling of securities for personal gain, with the knowing use of confidential information. While the whispers of the moneyed crowd are not usually the kind of information that will send its purveyors away in federally issued orange jumpsuits, the chattering classes do trade data on the subtle level of plain old sociability.
