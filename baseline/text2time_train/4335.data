He's been out of control for years, an international monster, created by adoring publics in Argentina and Italy, with too much money and too little discipline and no respect for anybody.

He punched a ball in the goal in the 1986 World Cup and made jokes about it coming from "the hand of God." He played when he felt like it for the Napoli club in Italy. I saw his coach slam a door in frustration one afternoon when he heard that Diego Armando didn't feel like coming to practice that day.

Maradona is paying a ton of lira to support a child named Diego Armando Jr. in Italy. He can't go back to Italy because he owes back taxes, yet even this week, people in Naples were working out the finances and the legalities to bring him back again. And don't bet against it.

Recently, Maradona has exhibited the mentality of what could be described as a druggie. He knows the score about everything. In 1990, he accused the World Cup "mafia" of wanting Argentina to lose to Germany in the finals.

A year ago, while he was in exile, Maradona heard that thugs had invaded the practice field in Naples, the one he used to avoid, and pummeled a few players from his old club. He had a classic theory: the owner must have cut a hole in the fence and asked the thugs to beat his players, who were performing badly.

Everything's a plot with Diego Armando. A man must be secure. Recently he fired an air pellet gun at journalists swarming around his home. His advisers slipped him away and he lost 26 pounds, which should have been a tipoff.

"No study has convincingly demonstrated enhanced athletic performance following large doses of ephedrine . . . or the lookalikes," writes Dr. Gary I. Wadler, a co-author of "Drugs and the Athlete," which has become a major reference in these chemical times. However, Wadler noted yesterday that ephedrine would have an effect "if weight is a value to the sport."
