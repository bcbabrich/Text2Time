Because of an editing error, an obituary yesterday about Irving P. Krick, a commercial weather forecaster, misattributed a comment about Dr. Krick's response to criticism of his work in some editions. It was Frederic Fox, president of Strategic Weather Services, who said: "He tried to do things that no one else claims you can do. His idea was you go out there and do it and prove it with the people that count -- the people that use it." The remark was not made by Loren Crow, a former colleague of Dr. Krick.
