The events of Sept. 11 scarred the skyline and jarred the language. From the first moments, the disaster required new terms to describe new facts and feelings. In the last year, a whole glossary has arisen to describe just about every aspect of the terrorist attacks. There's an ABC just for the international aspect (Al Qaeda, American Taliban, Axis of Evil . . .). A longer, more touching vocabulary has arisen specifically from the destruction of the twin towers, one reflecting strong human needs for utility and respect.

The event. At first, people spoke of the World Trade Center disaster or of the hijacked planes in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania or of the terrorist attacks on America. All the terms were either cumbersome or, by being selective, risked ignoring bravery and suffering elsewhere. The language needed shorthand. Within a few weeks, it had evolved: 9/11. The term, variously pronounced ''nine-eleven'' or ''nine-one-one,'' had been used in some places from the beginning. The New York Times 9/11 Neediest Fund, for instance, began on Sept. 12. The number of times the term appeared in The Times rose steadily, reaching a peak in December. By then, as if by informal national consensus, 9/11 had become universal shorthand for the whole event.

The people. The bland term ''first responders'' quickly morphed into ''heroes'' as the shocking loss of 343 firefighters and 23 New York City Police and 37 Port Authority officers sank in on the public. The world came to visualize firefighters climbing upstairs hefting heavy hoses or trudging downstairs carrying people in wheelchairs, and the respect radiated so widely that people soon associated ''heroes'' with emergency workers everywhere.

A different kind of respect showed in the words used to describe those unaccounted for in the World Trade Center. At first, they were ''the missing,'' a term that was then merely accurate. Who knew whether a loved one might turn up, for instance, in a New Jersey hospital across the Hudson. Later, what had been accurate became considerate. To avoid the blunt finality of ''dead,'' people referred to those ''lost'' on 9/11, out of respect for families still hoping against hope.
