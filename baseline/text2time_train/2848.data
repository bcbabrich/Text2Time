To the Editor:

In your Oct. 31 front-page article about the economy, the rapidly expanding gross domestic product in the third quarter is trumpeted. I'm puzzled. If in a quarter when the economy expands at a 7.2 percent annualized rate there is still a net loss of 85,000 jobs, how fast does the economy have to grow to actually create jobs?
