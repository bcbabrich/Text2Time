As wartime speeches go, it was a strange and schizophrenic one, laying its emphasis on two not-necessarily-compatible goals — victory, and a swift withdrawal. In one breath Obama was echoing his previous description of Afghanistan as a “war of necessity,” referencing our “vital national interests” and describing the conflict’s stakes as both “the security of our Allies, and the common security of the world.” The next he was offering the Taliban a date to circle on their calendars, and hold out for throughout the American offensive to come — July of 2011, that is, when the Obama administration is now committed to beginning the withdrawal of our forces from Afghanistan. This commitment, of course, was hedged with a substantial caveat: “We will execute this transition responsibly, taking into account conditions on the ground.” But still, the date is there: After more than eight years of fighting the United States, our enemies know that we’ve set ourselves a deadline to win or get out that’s only a short eighteen months away.

Judged solely as policy, simultaneously escalating and setting ourselves a near-term deadline might be the right approach to a war that may not be winnable, but that deserves a more significant commitment before we give it up as lost. But the White House could have set itself a private deadline without telling the world exactly what it is. And I’m skeptical that making the deadline so public, and so specific, won’t tend to undercut our military efforts. In the portion of the speech that aimed to pre-empt criticism from right and left alike, Obama argued that “the absence of a timeframe for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government.” But surely there are plenty of reasons for this administration to feel (and instill) a sense of urgency — from the weight of public opinion, to the restiveness of the Democratic base, to the strain on our military and our alliances — without adding the burden of a public deadline as well!

Broadly speaking, it struck me as one of Obama’s least effective speeches. I can’t imagine any anti-war liberal being convinced to favor escalation by his arguments. I can’t imagine any pro-escalation conservative feeling confident that Obama is really committed to the effort he’s embarking on. And above all, I can’t imagine any up-in-the-air, uncertain American being reassured that we have a military strategy capable of delivering a successful outcome — because Obama barely seemed to talk about military strategy at all.

Indeed, in this regard I think it’s worth comparing tonight’s speech, unfavorably, to George W. Bush’s address announcing the Iraqi surge. Whereas that speech was tightly focused on the shift in military and diplomatic strategy, Obama’s remarks tried to cover the history of the American involvement in Afghanistan, the state of our domestic politics, and even the nature of America’s mission in the world, while pre-butting various possible attacks on his decision-making. Obama was more comprehensive; Bush was much better. And now we have to hope that the President’s strategy is more successful than his speech.
