WASHINGTON, Feb. 1—The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to rescind its decision allowing 17 states, including New York, two additional years to come into compliance with air pollution limits.

In an order issued late yesterday, the court said that William D. Ruckelshaus, administrator of the agency, had acted “in the best of faith” in granting the extensions. Nevertheless, the court said that he had violated the “strict requirements of the Clean Air Act of 1970” and had thereby interfered with “the Congressional purpose of attaining clean air” by May 31, 1975, subject to certain “limited and well‐defined statutory extensions.”

The court directed Mr. Ruckelshaus to inform the 17 states that they must submit to him by April 15, 1973, corrected plans to comply fully with the requirements of the Clean Air Act for meeting primary standards by the 1975 target date, rather than two years later.

Such plans, the court said, must include proposals for transportation controls, as required by the law. Mr. Ruckelshaus had extended not only the time for meeting the air quality standards but also the time for submitting plans for transportation controls to reduce pollutants.
