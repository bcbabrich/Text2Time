New Jersey Transit plans to hire 30 more police officers in the next year for a total of 141 officers. Jeffrey A. Warsh, executive director of the agency, said higher salaries would make it easier to hire officers. A recent contract raised salaries to a range of $39,000 to $60,000 annually from a range of $29,000 to $47,000. New Jersey Transit is also adding three teams of bomb-sniffing dogs, and will have police officers meet trains as commuters stream onto platforms. Daily ridership to New York's Pennsylvania Station totaled nearly 34,000 before Sept. 11, peaked at 48,500 in mid-October, then leveled off at about 44,000 recently.
