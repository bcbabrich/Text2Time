A 42 ‐ year ‐ old drifter was shot and killed in Brooklyn by a foot patrolman at midnight Friday, when he allegedly tried to attack the policeman with an eight‐inch clasp knife.

According to the police of the Empire Boulevard station, Patrolman Craig Duryea was patrolling at Parkside Avenue and Bedford Avenue when a woman notified him that a man, apparently intoxicated, was throwing stones at pass ers‐by.

Patrolman Duryea found James Parrish, a 6‐foot one‐ inch drifter who weighed over 200 pounds, in front of 385 Parkside Avenue. When the officer asked him what he was doing, according to the police, Mr. Parrish cursed the patrol man and drew a knife from his belt. Patrolman Duryea drew his gun and told Mr. Parrish to drop the knife.

As the suspect lunged at him, Patrolman Duryea fired a warning shot over his head. When this failed to stop him, the policeman fired one shot after another at the attacker, emptying his service revolver.
