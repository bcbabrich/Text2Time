It was, by everyone's reckoning, a most unusual and most promising draft for the Giants. Coach Bill Parcells, with no more than three hours of sleep, seemed full of energy today as he assessed what his team had achieved the day before in the National Football League draft.

The Giants ended up with eight players on defense (four linemen, two linebackers, a cornerback and a safety) and six on offense (three wide receivers, two linemen and a running back). The quantity was good. The quality was deemed even better.

During the draft, the Giants traded away Mark Haynes and the rights to Gary Zimmerman. As part payment, they got four immediate draft choices, three in the second round. That gave them six choices in the first three rounds, and they took defensive players on all six. Extra Choices Beneficial

''You've got to feel good now,'' said Parcells. ''I think the strength of the draft was where we got extra choices. We took three defensive linemen there, and there weren't many.''
