For many gardeners, late July and early August are the time for nursery hunting. Heat, and prolonged drought in much of the Northeast, bring a lull in the garden. Fall looms ahead, with the cool nights and soft rains that make it the best time to plant new perennials. Plants will have a few months to establish vigorous root systems to get them through winter, ready to flourish next spring.

Nursery hunting, a rewarding sport, is a game that falls into three rough categories. There are the purely local nurseries, often very good. Treasures are more likely to be found in those nurseries with national reputations, which put out lists or catalogues but do not sell by mail order. Excellent examples of such nurseries are Hillside in Norfolk, Conn., Weston in Hopkinton, Mass., and Wells-Medina outside Seattle.

I have special affection, however, for those nurseries that deal mainly in mail orders but are open to the public, maintain display gardens and sell plants in containers. And I am naturally most interested in those from which I have ordered perennials.

Heronswood Nursery in Kingston, Wash., the Andre Viette Farm and Nursery in Fishersville, Va., and White Flower Farm in Litchfield, Conn., are a few of the many I have visited at this time of year. The visits always lift my spirits and renew my enthusiasm for gardening in this, the most disheartening period of the horticultural year. My car always looks like a greenhouse when I get home.
