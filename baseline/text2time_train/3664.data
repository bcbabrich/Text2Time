There is now little doubt that AIDS is becoming an epidemic of color, striking the African-American community to a disproportionate and devastating degree. Yet neither political leaders nor black institutions anticipated this demographic shift early enough to protect a vulnerable population that historically has been neglected in health care and prevention.

Recent data from 25 states compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that African-Americans account for 57 percent of new infections with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, even though they make up only 13 percent of the United States population. While death rates from AIDS have dropped for all groups, the declines have been much greater among whites than blacks. Young blacks fare even worse. In data collected between January 1994 and June 1997, blacks accounted for 63 percent of infected individuals between the ages of 13 and 24.

At the same time the disease is becoming more prevalent among women of all races, who account for more than a quarter of new infections. Young women, who make up 44 percent of those infected between the ages of 13 and 24, are especially hard hit. The changing face of the disease, from one with a vocal and educated constituency of gay men to one afflicting poor minorities, women and teen-agers, raises new challenges for prevention efforts.

As the demographics change, the Government's AIDS policies must change as well. Expansion of needle exchange programs, safer-sex education in schools and drug treatment efforts would help slow the virus's spread into new groups through needles and sexual contact. But posturing in Congress has blocked these common-sense measures, leaving desperate communities even more vulnerable to the epidemic. Efforts by the Centers for Disease Control to direct some AIDS prevention funds to agencies serving minorities should be expanded substantially.
