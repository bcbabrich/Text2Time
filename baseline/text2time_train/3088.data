OF course, part of the trans-Atlantic distinction lies in the deep cultural divide in attitudes toward success. In the United States, success stands as a beacon to the ambitious of what can be attained -- an outlook that appears to justify the kind of one-time windfall bonuses that bloat some American executive pay deals. In Europe, just as often, success breeds resentment.

That is one reason, despite moves toward more openness about corporate accounts, that individual salaries, bonuses and other perquisites are simply not disclosed in much of continental Europe. When GÃ¶ran Lindahl, then chief executive of ABB, the Zurich-based engineering giant, was asked in an interview how much he earned, he declined to answer. Mr. Lindahl said he would provide a figure only when the company moved to American accounting rules -- that is, when required to do so.

In Germany, too, only the total amount of basic salary paid to an entire board of directors is routinely disclosed to shareholders. Individual amounts are not given.

The executives' reticence is related to two aspects of the German mentality, said Ms. Bergdolt, the shareholder activist in Munich. ''We are not so open as Americans are about our salaries,'' she said in a telephone interview. ''At home, even the children don't know what the father earns. And we have a stronger envy complex. In the U.S.A., if you earn a lot, you show it. In Germany, people don't show how much they earn because we are quicker to envy.''

That could also be said of Britain, where the salaries of senior executives at the country's top 100 companies rose by an average of 20.4 percent last year, to around $1 million, according to New Bridge Street, a consulting firm in London. While that total is only about one-twelfth of the annual packages for the most successful American executives, the percentage increase far outstripped the national average pay gain of about 4 percent.

Another consulting firm, Towers Perrin, said Britain's chief executives were paid 24 times the average manufacturing salary -- the highest multiple in Europe -- compared with 15 in Germany and 13 in Sweden. The average American chief executive made 475 times as much as the average blue-collar worker in 1999, according to the A.F.L.-C.I.O.

Britain has twice sought to tighten rules on executive pay. A commission led by Lord Cadbury in 1992 urged the creation of compensation committees made up of independent nonexecutive directors. Another, under Sir Richard Greenbury, the former chairman of the retailer Marks & Spencer, proposed the principle that bonuses be linked to performance over several years. The results have been ambiguous.
