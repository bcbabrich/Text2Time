Etta James, a hefty 63-year-old who has been singing professionally since she was a teenager, was helped onto the stage at the B. B. King Blues Club by an attendant on Thursday night, and she performed seated. She had the haughty, jaded expression of an empress overseeing workaday matters, as if she took her attentive band and the adoring audience for granted. And though her most recent album, ''Blue Gardenia'' (Private Music/BMG), is a set of jazz standards, she didn't sing any of them. Instead, her set stuck to songs she may have performed thousands of times, mostly her hits from the 1950's and 1960's.

Yet on Thursday night, the beginning of a three-night stand on the first anniversary of the club (at 243 West 42nd Street in Manhattan), Ms. James's routine reached into some essence of American music: the soul alchemy of sorrow, laughter, carnality, fury, loss and hope.

Ms. James's voice remembers every stage of her life. She encompasses coy teenager and amorous woman, heartbroken lover and spiteful victim, party girl and desperate addict. Her 1995 autobiography, ''Rage to Survive,'' detailed her struggles with men, drugs and the music business, but her singing tells more.

She wields her voice with the timing of a falcon, breezing aloft and then darting directly and implacably toward its target. She flirts, sobs, chuckles, taunts, growls; she moans with satisfaction and with pain. In one song she sings quick, glancing lines, skimming them across a steady vamp; in the next she lingers over words, connecting them in long, caressing phrases. As she does, even her familiar songs illuminate the emotional turmoil that they sum up so concisely.
