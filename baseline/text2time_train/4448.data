BILL WYMAN, 56, the former Rolling Stones bass player, is 34 years older than his most recent wife, MANDY SMITH, now 22, whom he met when she was 13 and from whom he was divorced last year.

So it should not startle that his son from another marriage, STEPHEN WYMAN, who is 30, is planning to marry an older woman. The surprise is that she is PATSY SMITH, 46, Mandy Smith's mother -- and Bill Wyman's former mother-in-law.

The tangled situation -- Bill Wyman would become his former wife's stepgrandfather -- was reported yesterday by The Press Association, the British news service, which quoted an article in The Sun, a newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch.

The association said The Sun had reported that Stephen Wyman had bought an antique diamond and emerald engagement ring for Mrs. Smith, who is divorced from her first husband, and that the couple were shopping for a home.
