FPS Computing, formerly known as Floating Point Systems Inc., has reached agreements with Stellar Computer Inc. of Newton, Mass., to develop technology and manufacture equipment. Under the agreements, FPS, based in Beaverton, Ore., will market, sell and service Stellar's graphics supercomputers under its name.

The announcement coincided with the introduction of the FPS Model 500, a new supercomputer. The company has specialized in add-on array processors, which allow minicomputers and mainframes to perform some supercomputing tasks, and large highly specialized supercomputers. For Stellar, a relatively new company, the arrangement expands its distribution and service support.
