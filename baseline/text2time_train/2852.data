To the Editor:

The easiest way to deal with the flow of illegal immigrants (editorial, Nov. 26) is to make them legal. Let Mexicans enter the United States to work at those jobs that we Americans are too proud to do. The government would save money, businesses would make money and work would get done.

Mexicans are good people. They are excellent workers and hard-working ones at that. Mexicans will get the job done and do it well.

Workers of every sort built this land of ours. It will be workers who will build it anew. If Americans aren't up to the task, perhaps the Mexican worker is.
