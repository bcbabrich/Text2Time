To the Editor:

Reports on the glut of American physicians, as in your July 15-16 series on medicine and hospitals, fail to consider a relevant alternative.

Many developing countries have an appalling deficit of medical personnel.

While, in the United States as of 1980 we had one physician for each 550 people, in stark contrast, Haiti had one physician for each 5,990 people; Bangladesh, one for each 13,860; Nepal, one for each 30,780; Chad, one for each 49,070, and Ethiopia one for each 69,600.

Graduating U.S. physicians should be urged, if not required, to spend a period working in Latin America, Africa or Asia so that the basic human right of universal health care might be realized. HARRY M. ZUTZ, M.D.
