A baseball career can create a fantasylike effect on a man's life, but reality has intruded on Keith Hernandez's. One more disabling injury, he said, and his career is over.

''The injuries affect me a lot,'' the Cleveland Indians' new first baseman said last week. ''I've had two interrupted years where I couldn't get anything going. I don't know if I have another season in me that will be injury-free the rest of my career, whether it's one year or five years. If I get hurt again this year, I quit. It'll be my last year. I'm not going to go through another year like that. I'd be turning down a lot of money, but I'm not going through another year like the last two I've had. It's miserable.''

With the Mets last year, Hernandez suffered a broken kneecap when it was struck by a thrown ball. The year before he had hamstring problems. The combination limited him to 170 games after he had played 149 games or more in each of 10 successive seasons (except the strike year of 1981).

''It's very frustrating,'' he said. ''There's always a question in your mind, well, if I would have a full year, could I still do it. That's why I want to play; I want to find out. But if I have another year where I'm hurt, that's it.''
