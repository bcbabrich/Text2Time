Times must be tough in the one-income Bumstead household, which includes a couple of adolescent mall-hoppers, Cookie and Alexander, and a litter-dropping mutt named Daisy. Anyway, after six decades of vacuuming the living room, playing bridge and sending Dagwood downstairs to investigate noises in the night, Blondie is getting a job. That's earth-shaking, in the view of Dean Young, who took over the strip after his father, who created it, died in 1973. "This is the biggest thing to happen to Blondie since the birth of Cookie Bumstead back in '42," Mr. Young said last week. Actually, her job hunt appears consistent with Blondie's early search for the good life. She first appeared in 1930 as Blondie Boopadoop, flapper about town with an eye out for a rich bachelor. She snared Dagwood, feckless heir to the Bumstead Locomotive fortune. But Dagwood was disinherited after their marriage in 1933, and the Bumsteads have lived paycheck-to-paycheck ever since. The Young family, on the other hand, has doubtless prospered. The comic strip appears in more than 2,000 newspapers in 55 languages.
