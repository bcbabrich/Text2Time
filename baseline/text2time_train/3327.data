That truism is reflected in the way the convention program is structured. Virtually all the major speeches this week, from those of Laura Bush and Gen. Colin L. Powell tonight and continuing with Senator John McCain and Elizabeth Dole on Tuesday, the vice-presidential nominee, Dick Cheney, on Wednesday, and Gov. George W. Bush on Thursday, are to take place between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. That just happens to be the hour each night that one or more of the over-the-air networks will be covering the Philadelphia proceedings live.

''Everything is geared for the 10 to 11 o'clock hour,'' said Tom Hannon, the political director of CNN. ''They're obsessed about getting their message across in the 10 to 11 hour, and that is their driving concern. People say that the conventions are for cable, but as far as the parties are concerned, the conventions are for the most eyeballs they can get.''

Tonight, the Republicans got those eyeballs, at least on ABC, but not exactly the program they had concocted. Like clockwork, the preseason football game -- begun an hour early to accommodate the convention coverage -- ended a few minutes before 10 p.m., paving the way for Peter Jennings to introduce several minutes of highlights before seguing about a third of the way into a speech by Laura Bush. CBS broke into its ''48 Hours'' program early with an update and returned at 10:30 to cover the final half-hour.

Viewers of ABC got a taste of what cable and PBS broadcast all night: an unusual showcase for multiculturalism. It was certainly the ''different'' sort of Republican evening the planners promised: videos of Gospel choirs and vignettes of inner-city school students, who were used at times to underline the Bush campaign's promises of a more inclusive kind of Republicanism and to reinvigorate education reform.

Governor and Mrs. Bush -- the former appearing by satellite from a classroom in Westerville, Ohio -- both spoke with backdrops consisting of children seated at desks. For Mrs. Bush's remarks, ABC even spliced in footage from a graduation ceremony in Crawford, Tex., that the Bushes had attended.
