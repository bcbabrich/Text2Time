To the Editor:

With his word processor foaming at the terminal, John Chancellor inveighs against the use of the article ''an'' before the words ''historian'' and ''historical'' (Op-Ed, Nov. 20). He attributes the ''error'' to Cockney influence, which is rather hard on Gibbon, Coleridge, E. A. Freeman and the rest of us historians and critics who follow their example.

The true cause is, in fact, simple and direct: it is the natural wish to avoid the stop and start (technically hiatus) that occurs when one says ''a'' before aspirated ''h.'' We manage it in ''a history,'' because the main word is stressed on the first syllable and requires the effort anyway. But when the vowel is weak and unstressed, as in ''historian,'' the ''h'' is reduced to the merest breath and calls for ''an'' to precede it.

This change is automatic and general. We say ''a habit of crime'' and ''an habitual criminal.'' Unless reared in the deep South, Mr. Chancellor himself probably says ''th

ee historical fact'' and not ''thuh,'' so as to avoid making a halt and a push between syllables. For the same reason, all of educated England says ''wich'' for the relative pronoun that slips unstressed into the middle of a sentence. The same word, when interrogative, comes stressed at the beginning and is noticeably ''hwich.''
