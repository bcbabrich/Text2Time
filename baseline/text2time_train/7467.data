BOSTON, June 30 (AP) —Rocky Colavito drove in two runs with a home run and double and three Kansas City pitchers combined to hurl a two‐hitter as the Athletics defeated the Boston Red Sox, 2—1, today.

Two right‐handers, Moe Drabowsky and Wes Stock, held the Red Sox to one hit until the ninth, when Carl Yastrzemski spoiled the A's shutout bid with a home run off StocK. John Wyatt then went in and preserved Drabowsky's third victory by getting the last two Red Sox hitters.
