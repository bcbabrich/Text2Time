In 1930 Dorothea Lange was a genteel portrait photographer in San Francisco, producing slightly soft-focus, moodily lighted images in a style recalling that of her teachers, the well-known pictorialists Arnold Genthe and Clarence White. Over the next five years, though, Lange traveled a remarkable distance in her work, turning from polite portraits to the searing, unforgettable images of migrant workers and rural poverty that cemented her fame.

This shift is the unstated subject of the fascinating if somewhat jumbled show of Lange's photographs now at the Houk-Friedman Gallery. This show includes some of Lange's most famous images, including "Migrant Mother," the classic 1936 photograph of a woman, her face lined with worry, whose children press themselves to her body.

Also included are photographs from the 1950's, including two from a project on trials, taken in an Oakland courtroom. But nearly half of the 41 pictures here were made in the three years before 1935, when Lange was invited to join other photographers in documenting the work of the Resettlement Administration, the New Deal farm agency better known by its later name, the Farm Security Administration.

Not surprisingly, the catalyst for Lange's transformation from portraitist to documentarian was the Depression. In 1932, with poor and unemployed people crowding San Francisco, she took her camera into the streets. One of the first images she made working in this new way, "White Angel Bread Line," has become an icon of the period. In it, a man turns away from a crowd lining up for food, his stained, shapeless hat pulled down around his ears and his mouth set in a grim line.
