A rookie policeman fired two shots at a knife‐wielding man in a Bronx liquor store last night after the man cut him in the neck, the police said.

It was at 9:20, the police re ported, that a 20‐year‐old man identified as Willis Pearson en tered the Stebbins Liquor Store at 1108 Stebbins Avenue, brandishing a knife. At that time Patrolman Danield Cola suonno, 23, was in a rear wash room at the store.

He came out front and or dered the man to drop the knife, the police said. Instead, they reported, the man lunged at the patrolman cutting him on the right side of the neck. The patrolman reportedly again ordered the man to drop the weapon and, when he refused, fired once and then a second time as the man kept advanc ing toward him, the police said.

The suspect was taken to Lincoln Hospital in serious con dition while the patrolman had his wound treated at Jacobi Hospital.
