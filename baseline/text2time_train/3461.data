The American Government is shouldering a modest number of the immigrants in comparison with some of its NATO allies, and has been facing pressure from Macedonia and Germany -- which has already resettled 10,000 of the 24,000 Kosovar Albanians it pledged to take in.

Mr. Shala said he prays that the rest of his family will make its way from Kosovo to Macedonia, perhaps at the border crossing in Lojan and Blace, where United Nations relief workers said more than 10,000 Kosovar Albanians have arrived since Monday. Last week, in a phone call to Macedonia, Mr. Shala spoke with the brothers and cousin he has already offered to take in. ''They said to me, 'We don't have food to eat, a place to sleep,' '' Mr. Shala recalled. ''They said, 'Please, do something for us.' ''

''I have to do something for my people,'' he said.

Shehide Berisha, an actress, said she has been checking an Internet site, www.refugjat.org, where a nonprofit organization is posting the names and locations of more than 63,000 ethnic Albanians, looking for news of her parents and her brother.

The family has been scattered across Europe by the conflict, with her father in Pristina while her mother, who is diabetic, was sent on to Albania. ''My Mom is a Catholic, so she is going to a Catholic church where they give her insulin,'' Ms. Berisha said. A sister and her three children have made it to Germany.

Ms. Berisha heard that her brother had managed to Pristina, to stay with an uncle. ''Later, I heard that 70 people were killed in the neighborhood where my uncle lives,'' she said. She did not know if her relatives were among them.

Jerry Gjonbalaj, a 32-year-old restaurant manager in Tuckahoe, N.Y., said that Serb paramilitary forces had given his extended family of 23 people half an hour to leave their home in Pec, Kosovo. Now, they were stateless and scattered -- in Albania, Macedonia and Bosnia. ''We're all just kind of lost,'' he said.

''I think about my Mom and the other part of my family there, and what they're going through,'' Mr. Gjonbalaj said. ''It makes it hard to show love to my wife and kids here.'' Because he did not know where his family is, he could not apply for them to come here.
