Then came the Italian-style wines. Barbera had been around for generations. It was a workaday grape producing workaday wine. Then suddenly sangiovese, the Chianti grape, was chic. Everyone planted it. The Robert Mondavi Winery came out with a line of Italian-style wines, with new labels and oddly shaped bottles.

Merlot is still the trendy grape for most consumers, but its star could be waning. Zinfandel may steal its spotlight. Once, zinfandel was a coarse blending grape. Then it was an inexpensive varietal. Then, for a decade, much of it was diverted into white zinfandel, a sweetish wine that also seems to have run its course.

For a long time, zinfandel was called America's mystery grape. For years, it was thought to have come from Italy. Last year, it was traced to Croatia. This year, maybe we'll be told how it got there.

This will also be a year for pinot noir. The delicate grape of Burgundy, at the other end of the refinement scale from zinfandel, has been growing in popularity in a befittingly genteel way. And wineries like Napa Ridge in California and the King Estate in Oregon have figured out how to make good pinot noir at reasonable prices.

This could also be the year for oddballs. Guenoc, a winery in Lake County, north of Napa County, Calif., is making a wine from petit verdot, an old variety that turns up in minute quantities in good Bordeaux.

Shooting Star, a second label for Steele Wines, also in Lake County, offers something called Blue Franc, which is made from the lemberger grape, grown in Washington State.

And there is a new label from Chile, Veramonte, which features a wine made from something called primus merlot. This, we are told, is actually another Bordeaux antique called carmenere. Apparently, the vine was shipped to Chile in the 1800's, along with some merlot, and for years the two were considered to be the same vine. They are not, says Veramonte.
