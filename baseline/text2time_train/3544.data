Taina inhabits a hip, contemporary urban world that comes with eclectic music -- salsa, R&B, hip-hop -- and she has three best friends, two black and one white. Her nemesis at school is Maritza Diaz, born to a Puerto Rican father and an African-American mother and ''a character kids love to hate,'' Ms. Perez-Brown said. The producer modeled it after the girl who stole her boyfriend when the was 14.

In selling ''Taina,'' Ms. Perez-Brown said, she tailored the story to cater to the network's taste -- realistic characters, with a child's point of view, who delve into issues that appeal to a general audience of children. She said she pitched the show armed with well-developed characters, 13 story lines (enough for a season), research from focus groups of Latino and black teenagers (their favorite show: ''Seinfeld'') and a business proposition.

''I said, here's an opportunity for you to make a bunch of money,'' she said. ''In a way, it's giving them a model for how to sell the series, how to promote it. How to use the music to make records and music videos, how to take advantage of subsidiary uses for this property. You can't assume they see the vision you have for the show.''

While excited about the project, executives of Nickelodeon, which has invested about $600,000 on development, also want it to maintain a broad appeal. Ms. Perez-Brown and the executives said a large part of the give-and-take in the development process was how to balance accurate portrayals with the need to keep both Hispanic and non-Hispanic viewers interested. What is the right mix of references to the Latino family? How much Spanish to include? Would everyone get the jokes?

''How do we keep the authenticity while keeping everybody else involved?'' Mr. Hecht said. ''There is a sweet spot.''

That balancing effort was in evidence at a script reading by cast members for the pilot episode last month. A common teenager-parent issue -- when are children old enough to make their own decisions? -- was given a Hispanic spin (applicable to other ethnic groups as well) when the extended family butts in after Taina has announced that she wants to join the touring band.
