PHOENIX, Ariz., May 29—The California Presidential primary has inflicted temporary paralysis on the Republican machinery of Senator Barry Goldwater's home state.

“We're not making any firm plans until after Tuesday,” one Republican official said. “That's going to be the big day.”

His rooters at home, like many political analysts, believe that a victory in California would guarantee the Republican nomination for Senator Goldwater.

But they are not so optimistic about the Senator's chances against President Johnson.

“You've got to be a realist,” Harry Rosenzweig, one of the Senator's closest friends, said.
