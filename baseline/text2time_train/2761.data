Father Borstelmann said he had agreed with a recommendation by experts from the archdiocese that the number of grades be cut because the school was down to about 100 students and was hemorrhaging money. But many parents were angry. They complained to the cardinal, who overruled the priest. Father Borstelmann had no choice but to go along with the decision. But he refused to fire Sister Mazza.

''That's unjust,'' he said. ''I would not do it.'' He said the cardinal relented on the issue of Sister Mazza, but Father Borstelmann said he was sure the cardinal declined to extend his term at St. Joseph's because of the two issues.

''That's my guts,'' he said. ''I can't prove it.'' He said he never received an explanation about why the cardinal wanted Sister Mazza out. ''Obviously there was something that rubbed him the wrong way,'' he said. ''There's some sort of retaliation for not firing her last year.''

He also said it was possible the cardinal was trying to put distance between him and Sister Mazza. The priest said he had had to contend with a rumor spread by his opponents that he and the nun are sexually involved.

''It's a lie,'' he said. ''People who don't like us, don't like the way I lead, are looking for ways to sabotage and undermine and destroy.''

Sister Mazza, who is 58 and lives in an apartment over the parish's early-childhood center, said she came to St. Joseph's 11 years ago after Cardinal Egan, then bishop of Bridgeport, Conn., ordered her fired from St. Thomas parish in Norwalk. She said she was told at the time by her pastor, who has since died, that Bishop Egan felt she was too assertive in her pastoral work.

''What Cardinal Egan would tell you is I am the pastor here and not Jim, which is an outright lie,'' she said in a telephone interview Friday. ''This parish was dead until Jim came here.''
