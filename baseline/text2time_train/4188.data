Michael D. Eisner, the Walt Disney chairman and one of the most ferociously ambitious people in Hollywood, has hungered for a television network for nearly a decade. And while there are many business reasons for buying Capital Cities/ABC, the personal ones are just as important.

Mr. Eisner, who is 53, was drawn to ABC because it is the No. 1 television network in prime time and news, its daytime viewers have the most appealing demographics, its cable holdings (including the ESPN sports network) are especially lucrative and its family-oriented programs fit Disney's credo. ABC, in fact, calls itself the family network.

Beyond that, though, Mr. Eisner's ego needed a deal like this one. The $19 billion plan to acquire Capital Cities/ABC, announced today, comes at a time when Mr. Eisner has not fully recovered from a year of setbacks, including heart bypass surgery last summer, the unexpected death of Frank G. Wells, his No. 2, in a helicopter accident 15 months ago and the acrimonious departure of a longtime associate, Jeffrey Katzenberg, who was chairman of the studio, in September. Other top executives, as well as some important animators, have also left.

Mr. Eisner said today that the deal "is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create an outstanding entertainment and media company." Appearing today on ABC's "Good Morning America," with Thomas S. Murphy, chairman of Capital Cities/ABC, Mr. Eisner said the deal came together at a business conference last month in Sun Valley, Idaho.
