THE group which quite naturally receives the greatest amount of assistance from the Algerian Government is their fellow Arab organization, Al Fatah, which has a recruit ment, and propaganda office on Algiers's main street. One poster on the wall shows an American flag with, instead of 50 stars, one large, six‐pointed star, and the caption: “The favorite state.” Another poster shows the Star of David with ramifications that make it look like a swastika and the caption: “Nazionism.” There was considerable commotion in the office as young men arrived to offer their services as guerrilla fighters.

“We have a reservoir of manpower here,” said the spokesman, a large, florid man named Madhi Saidam. “We have more than we can use.” But at the time, Pales tinian manpower was being diverted from its original aim and was fighting the Jordan ian Army, a prospect which Algerian volunteers may have found less appealing.

If the Palestinians and the move ments from the Portuguese colonies can be said to be in their adolescence, the movements from the three Eng lish‐speaking colonies of Rhodesia, South Africa, and South‐West Africa are still in their infancy. Johnnie Makatini of South Africa's National African Congress summed it up for all three when he said that “so far, we haven't fired a shot in an or ganized way. We are faced with the largest colonial population of any country, and we are surrounded by colonial powers. We have no friendly borders. We have no trained fighters because the Government always kept indigenous people out of the army, away from the guns. Repression is severe. In other countries the death penalty is being abolished, in South Africa its use is being increased. In Pretoria a man is hanged every three days. We are not educated. Vorster says it is enough for us to know how to read road signs. We must not be shown the green pastures where we will never graze.”

THE liberation movement which might he given the award of “least likely to succeed” is the Movement for the Self‐Determination and Inde pendence of the Canarian Archipel ago. The Canary Islands are a pros perous tourist paradise off the west coast of Africa, where it is balmy all year round. There is no racial prob lem because there is no black popula tion, although there are still some 7‐foot‐tall descendants of the Cro Magnon man. On perhaps the pret tiest of the 12 islands, Gomera, people speak by whistling. One of the princi pal exports is flowers. Revolution there seems as incongruous as revolu tion in Camelot or Brigadoon. And yet in Algiers there is a young lawyer named Antonio Cubillo who is dedi cated to the overthrow of Spanish rule in the Canary Islands. “We may not be black,” he told me, “but we have an African history and an African personality.”

To those who object that “you're too small to be independent,” Cubillo points out that nine other African countries are less populated than the Canary Islands, and that the Mauri tius Islands, although smaller in size, are independent. “We could have the highest standard of living in Africa,” Cubillo says. “We have universities and cadres. We have one doctor for eight inhabitants. We have the fifth biggest oil refinery in the world, 150 to 200 ships call each day to be fueled. We are the biggest exporters of bananas in the world, half a million tons each year.”

But according to Cubillo, the wealth is being siphoned off by the Spanish, whose conquest of the is lands goes back to the 15th century, and by the more recent plundering of foreign entrepreneurs. “Those damned Swedes,” he said, “they own the hotels, the travel agencies, the buses and the night clubs. And all the stores are run by Hindus. They are the first ones we are going to get rid of.”

NO matter how bleak the pros pects of some of these groups, they can tell themselves that history is on their side in this century of decoloni zation. The domino theory also ap plies to Africa. Each newly independ ent state makes the hold on the remaining colonies more precarious. All the movements share a certain number of assumptions. They all came to recognize the necessity of armed struggle only after a fruitless period of peaceful resistance. Cleaver says: “With us it was the death of Martin Luther King. That exhausted the myth .that you could get what you want without fighting, that when the plantation foreman cracks the whip you turn the other cheek.” In South Africa, says Johnnie Makatini, “it was the same year Albert Luthuli won the Nobel Peace Prize that we opted for violence. On the day he came back from Stockholm, Dec. 15, 1961, there were explosions all over the country.” In Portuguese Guinea, says Joseph Turpin, it was after the police killed 50 striking longshore men in Pijiguiti in 1959 that “we decided armed struggle was the only way.”
