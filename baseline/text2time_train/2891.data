Mr. Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator, said of Mr. Sharon's comment, ''A prime minister in his country who would say something about killing people or liquidating people -- it's a gangster mentality.''

Mr. Arafat and other Palestinians believe that Israel repeatedly tried to kill him in Lebanon with bombing raids that, like other efforts to assassinate him over the years, barely missed their target.

As the conflict has dragged on, the Bush administration has increasingly backed Mr. Sharon. Today, with obvious reluctance, it gently rebuked him for publicly regretting that Israel missed a chance to kill the Palestinian leader. Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said he did not have ''any particular comment.'' But he added that both sides should ''avoid remarks that inflame the situation.''

''Remarks like these can be unhelpful,'' he said.

The Bush administration has repeatedly said that Mr. Arafat has done too little to stop Palestinian violence. Last week, President Bush suggested that Mr. Arafat was ''enhancing terror,'' citing Israel's capture on Jan. 4 of a ship smuggling munitions under Palestinian command. Mr. Arafat has said he had nothing to do with the ship.

Though he wished Mr. Arafat dead, Mr. Sharon insisted in the interview that he had not given up on the Palestinian leader as a potential partner for peace. ''If Arafat takes all the steps we are demanding that he take, as far as I am concerned, he will again be a partner to negotiations,'' Mr. Sharon said. Israel insists that Mr. Arafat crush all Palestinian militant groups and take other steps to prevent violence before any substantive negotiations resume.

Mr. Sharon reiterated his support for the establishment of a Palestinian state, albeit a limited one. ''Ultimately, an independent Palestinian state will be established, which will be demilitarized and will have only a police force, to keep public order,'' he told Maariv. ''In order to have true peace, I am willing to relinquish portions of Israel.''

Mr. Sharon has previously indicated that he would give up about 42 percent of the West Bank, which Israel took by force in the 1967 war. Less than two years ago, Mr. Arafat rejected as insufficient an offer from Ehud Barak, then the Israeli prime minister, of more than twice that much territory.
