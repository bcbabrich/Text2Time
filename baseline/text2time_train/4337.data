The most charismatic character in "A Place in the World," an elegaic remembrance of the hardscrabble existence in a remote Argentine valley, is a cynical Spanish geologist named Hans Meyer Plaza who calls himself a "hired gun." Hans, played with a fiery gravity by Jose Sacristan, has been employed by an unnamed multinational corporation to determine the feasibility of a hydroelectric project in the desolate Bermejo Valley, 90 miles from Buenos Aires.

Hans, who has also been checking the area for oil, professes indifference to the fact that his work might precipitate the eradication of a pastoral society that has existed for centuries. In his Darwinian view, human beings are "primates who cannot be changed."

The audience for his speech includes Mario and Ana (Federico Luppi and Cecilia Roth), political idealists who have organized the valley's shepherds into a cooperative, and their colleague Nelda (Leonor Benedetto), a politically committed nun who refuses to wear clerical garb. Exiled to Spain during Argentina's military dictatorship, Mario and Ana have returned to their homeland to work for a more just society.

One of the triumphs of the film, which opens today at Lincoln Plaza Cinema, is its portrayal of Mario, Ana and Nelda as complex, quirky adults with genuinely noble instincts. They are good people, but not too good to be true.
