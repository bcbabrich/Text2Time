An article on Feb. 19 about the selection of the 2005 New York Times College Scholars omitted the name of the program's principal sponsor. It is The New York Times Company Foundation. The article also referred incompletely to the fund sources for the 21 scholarships. In addition to the program's endowment, which will pay for 3 scholarships this year, 8 scholarships are paid by the foundation and 10 by annual contributions from readers.
