Christopher Berkey for The New York Times

Should you happen to be watching Cinemax next week and discover that it isn’t broadcasting images of naked bodies, do not be alarmed. You may be watching one of its many, many showings of “Tropic Thunder,” or — in a rare instance of a cable channel treating a music video like a movie event — you may be tuning into its world premiere of a new video by the rock band Dead Weather. In a news release, the band, whose members include Jack White (of the White Stripes and the Raconteurs), Alison Mosshart (the Kills), Dean Fertita (Queens of the Stone Age) and Jack Lawrence (the Greenhornes and the Raconteurs), said that it would show the video, for its song “Treat Me Like Your Mother,” on Cinemax, whose programming also includes the series “Lingerie,” “The Erotic Traveler” and “Co-Ed Confidential.” The video, directed by Jonathan Glazer (“Sexy Beast”) will have its premiere on July 11 at 9:55 p.m., and will continue to be shown on Cinemax’s various channels for the next five weeks. A preview of the video can be found here at the Dead Weather’s official Web site.
