To the Editor:

Edward Morgan (Op-Ed, Dec. 25) argues that religion needs to be put back into government and public life and that many of our social ills are the result of not having done so. But ours is the most religious of the industrialized countries. Yet we rank poorly by many measures of social well-being -- for example, poverty, homelessness, child welfare, and so on.

Religion may well console some individuals at the bottom of the heap and may help some lift themselves out of despair. But the other side of the coin is the piety and callousness that leaves salvation to the churches and individual effort while dismantling the government programs that have protected those at the bottom.

The poor would benefit more from the repair and restoration of a civilized social welfare policy, including a progressive tax schedule, than from government promotion of religion.
