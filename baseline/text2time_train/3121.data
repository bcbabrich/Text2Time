The Federal Trade Commission has cleared the way for Cable and Wireless of Britain to acquire Digital Island, an American Internet company, for more than $300 million, officials said. The companies had been waiting to receive approval from the F.T.C. under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act; the waiting period allows commission officials and the Justice Department to consider antitrust issues. Cable and Wireless, a global telecommunications company that had about $11.5 billion in revenue last year, said May 14 that it would buy Digital Island, of San Francisco, for $340 million plus the assumption of about $50 million of debt. The companies said the merger would not require a review by the Office of Fair Trading in Britain or by the European Commission. But the companies have agreed to submit it to the United States Committee of Foreign Investment, which considers national security issues when foreign companies buy American ones.
