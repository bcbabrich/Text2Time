Stephen P. Schwartz, 53, will have a sensitive job as the person in charge of two midrange office systems -System/36 and System/38 - that have been lagging in rugged competition with minicomputers from other companies. Mr. Schwartz will head the I.B.M. Application Business Systems, which will be responsible for System/3X products.

I.B.M. needs to revive the midrange systems to compete with the Digital Equipment Corporation and other minicomputer makers. This year, the company is expected to announce ''Silverlake,'' a hardware and software project that will finally make System/36 and System/38 compatible.

Analysts describe Mr. Schwartz as fair, aggressive and technically sophisticated. He joined the company in 1957 and has worked in sales, development and general management positions. In 1984, he embarked on some telecommunications assignments, including the job of president and chief executive of Satellite Business Systems. He became president of the system products division in 1985.

Mr. Schwartz holds a degree in industrial engineering from Northwestern University.
