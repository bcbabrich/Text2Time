The Western Union Corporation, hoping to avoid involuntary bankruptcy, completed a deal today to sell its telex and electronic mail businesses to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company for $180 million.

Western Union will use the money to buy back some of its "junk bonds," helping to ease its interest-payment burden. Its remaining operations are a money-transfer service, electronic bill-paying service and electronic letter services like Mailgram.

Western Union will buy back $335 million worth of junk bonds at 50 cents on the dollar, the company said. The buyback involves $329 million worth of 19 1/4 percent notes and $6 million of 16 percent notes from investors who accept the offer by Thursday. Western Union's debt will be $311 million after the buyback.
