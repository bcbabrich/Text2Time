The trial is expected to last two days.

Mr. Bove was a little-known farmer and union official until last August, when he and the nine other men took a tractor, pick axes and power saws to the local McDonald's. Mr. Bove said at the time that he was incensed by what he saw as the unfairness of the United States to tax French delicacies like Roquefort cheese and pate de foie gras in retaliation for Europe's decision not to import hormone-treated American beef.

''That tax decision was outrageous,'' said Arianne Gurreau, a schoolteacher who was camping with her boyfriend. ''I think the judge needs to see that there are all these people who think what he did was correct. We are fighting for values here, for the right to care about what we eat.''

Many came with their own fights inspired by Mr. Bove. ''What prompted us to come is the problem of water,'' said Giselle Joffre, a retired government worker. ''In our town it is terribly expensive because we are working with a big company. It is the same with all these multinationals doing what they want.''

This was clearly not what many Millau residents had braced for. Most had seen pictures of protesters, including Mr. Bove, at the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle and feared that this demonstration would be just as disruptive.

''People were so scared,'' said Christianne Chazal-Martin, the owner of a gift shop near the courthouse who decided to stay open. ''First one got talking and then another, and they went on and on about how bad it was going to be.''

Mr. Bove's attack on the McDonald's here last August was only one of a number of assaults on the fast food chain, which is often a target of anti-American protesters. But Mr. Bove became instantly famous when he was thrown in jail for it, and then refused to pay bail for three weeks in protest. Eventually, he did pay the bail with money supplied by a group of supporters, many of them American.

Mr. Bove faces charges that could result in a fine of as much as $70,000 and up to five years in jail. But it is considered unlikely that he or any of his co-defendants will serve any jail time for the vandalism, which resulted in $110,000 worth of damage.
