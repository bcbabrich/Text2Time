KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo — Several senior officials in President Joseph Kabila’s government were hit with sanctions this week by the European Union and the United States for “planning, directing or committing” serious human rights violations in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The officials, who will face sanctions that include travel bans and asset freezes, are close allies of Mr. Kabila, whose second and last presidential term expired in December. However, he remains in office until the end of this year under a pact reached with the main opposition coalition.

The sanctions are aimed at pushing the government to hold an election to replace Mr. Kabila by the end of the year.

One of the officials sanctioned Thursday by the United States was Gen. Francois Olenga, Mr. Kabila’s chief military adviser.
