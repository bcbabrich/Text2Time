Dan Henning, back in college football for the first time in 20 years and glad of it, takes Boston College to Ann Arbor, Mich., to play Michigan on Saturday and he feels comfortable about that, too.

"I'm excited about this," the 52-year-old Henning said today. "It's what I've done all my life. First games, whether they've been last year, two years ago or 10 years ago, they are always exciting. But that will wash fast after the first couple of plays. You slip quickly into the routine, what you've prepared for."

The Eagles, decided underdogs, will field 15 veterans from last year's team that stunned Notre Dame at South Bend and finished with 9-2 record.

There is a gap, however, at quarterback, where a raw sophomore, Mark Hartsell of Brockton, Mass., will replace Glenn Foley, now a Jet. As a backup last season Hartsell threw only two passes and completed one.
