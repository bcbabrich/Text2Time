"Also, baseball players got only 53 percent of baseball's revenues in 1993, when N.F.L. players got 70 percent of N.F.L. revenues," the football union said. "There are 343 players making more than $1 million a year in the N.F.L. versus only 270 in baseball. The average salary in Major League Baseball is $1.2 million, but there are only 25 players on a M.L.B. roster. The average salary for the top 25 players per N.F.L. team is $1.05 million.

The football union also reminded its membership that "the average N.B.A. player salary is $1.6 million, but there are only 12 players on an N.B.A. team roster. The average salary for the top 12 players per N.F.L. team is $1.5 million. The average salary for all players in the N.F.L. (about 60 a team) is $737,0000; up 51 percent in 1993, when baseball salaries went up only 5 percent and basketball salaries went up only 11 percent."

The statements were not meant to critique a fellow union's stance, or endorse either baseball's current system as opposed to the one behind proposed by owners, Carl Francis, the director of communications for the football union, said.

"That's totally not our job," he said.

Still, all of the above information has been latched onto by no less than Richard Ravitch, the chief negotiator for baseball owners. Just as baseball players have latched onto the cause of discontented football players.

Francis knows his union's attempt to clear up misconceptions has seeped into baseball's fight.

"Look, it's Richard Ravitch's right to interpret this any way he wants to," Francis said. "But what we were concerned about, what we were trying to show our players, is that this system is beneficial to them."
