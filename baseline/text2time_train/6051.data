PARIS, Friday, June 3—The 27‐nation north‐south talks ended tonight with major oil‐producing countries and other developing lands refusing to agree to the. demands of the United States and the rest of the industrial world for continuing consultations on energy questions.

While the eight so‐called rich countriesof the north thus failed to achieve their principal objectives, the 19 developing or poor countries of the south won some economic concessions in the form of pledges of assistance. But they regarded the pledges as inadequate.

The disappointment of both sides was expressed in the communiqué issued at the end of 18 months of talks whose aim had been to agree on a program of international economic reforms to help the poorer ‐countries of the world and improve the industrial countries'. relations with them.

The developing countries said “the results fall short of the objectives envisaged,” although they recognized that “certain progress has been made.” The industrial countries expressed regret at the lack of agreement on energy but welcomed “the spirit of cooperation in which, on the whole, the conference took place.”
