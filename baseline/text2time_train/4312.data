The lawyer for a group of Hasidic leaders in Brooklyn said yesterday that he would propose a settlement in the Federal lawsuit against New York City and former Mayor David N. Dinkins stemming from the racial violence in Crown Heights in the summer of 1991.

The lawyer, Franklyn H. Snitow, would not say what the terms the plaintiffs would accept but said any settlement would include a cash payment by the city and a consent decree from officials to react more forcefully when disturbances flare up.

Mr. Snitow said he was preparing to present the settlement proposal at the request of an aide to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who joined with Jewish leaders from Crown Heights during last year's mayoral campaign in denouncing Mr. Dinkins's handling of the disturbances.

But Mr. Giuliani said it was premature to discuss any settlement. "There is no proposed settlement," he said at a news conference. "The city isn't moving toward any." To Review Any Offer
