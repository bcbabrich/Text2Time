''THE first time I realized he had an AIDS-related illness is when I went to visit him in the hospital,'' said the president of a manufacturing company in lower Westchester, referring to one of his clerical employees. ''Two weeks later, he was able to come back to work. However, due to a company restructuring that took place before he went to the hospital, he works on the night shift, alone, so I really don't know how our other employees would have felt about working side-by-side with him in the office.

''They don't seem hostile, but my guess is that some of them would have treated him like a pariah,'' the executive continued. ''People are so terrified of AIDS that they act irrationally. As an employer, facing human concerns and a magnitude of medical and legal problems brought on by the AIDS epidemic, I'm extremely worried. My fear is that we're just beginning to see the tip of the iceberg in the work place.''

His fears and the fears of many other employers came under scrutiny at a recent conference on AIDS that was presented by United Hospital and held in White Plains. ''If you don't have cases of AIDS yet,'' one participant warned, ''just wait - you'll have some by tomorrow.''

The representatives of 100 Westchester companies heard one panelist, Dr. Leon J. Warshaw, fault companies that ignored the serious implications of AIDS in the workplace. Dr. Warshaw, executive director of the New York Business Group on Health, an industry-labor coalition that was a co-sponsor of the conference, referred to AIDS as a catastrophic illness and advised companies to gird for an AIDS epidemic. He recommended that they develop corporate policies to deal with such issues as adequate medical coverage and the legal rights of employees who have AIDS.
