What we’re reading (and watching) on Wednesday morning.

Gimme a head with hair: In today’s New York Times, Ben Brantley assesses the long, long, long-in-the-works Broadway transfer of “Hair,” whose seeds were sown in a 2007 concert performance and a 2008 production at the Delacorte Theater, writing that the latest cast is “tearing down the house in the production that opened on Tuesday night at the Al Hirschfeld Theater. And any theatergoer with a pulse will find it hard to resist their invitation to join the demolition crew. This emotionally rich revival of ‘The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical’ from 1967 delivers what Broadway otherwise hasn’t felt this season: the intense, unadulterated joy and anguish of that bi-polar state called youth.” Writing for Bloomberg News, Jeremy Gerard says of the “Hair” revival that “for all its references to hippies, Vietnam, free love and the revolution, feels utterly of the moment in its exuberance, its power to involve and, in Diane Paulus’s entrancing production, to move us.” But in the Boston Globe, Louise Kennedy writes that the show “has not, to put it mildly, aged well. What may once have seemed winningly ingenuous and gently rebellious now feels unbearably naive and unforgivably glib. The antiwar sentiments of the show are still painfully relevant but uselessly one-dimensional, and beyond that there’s . . . what? Drug jokes, sex jokes, squares-vs.-hippie jokes, and a lot of other stuff that must have sounded a little corny even the first time around.”

In a global recession, do moviegoers want films about the joys or the horrors of unfettered capitalism? Even Hollywood isn’t sure: Variety reports that a new film version of Jay McInerney’s novel “Bright Lights, Big City,” about a disillusioned writer in class-conscious New York, is in the works, to be directed by Josh Schwartz, the creator of “Gossip Girl” and “The O.C.” Meanwhile, The Hollywood Reporter says that Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged” will also be made into a movie. Angelina Jolie, Charlize Theron, Julia Roberts and Anne Hathaway are among the actors on the short list to play the fictional railroad executive Dagny Taggart.

Our favorite headline announcing the US Postal Service’s decision to issue stamps based on “The Simpsons” comes from BBC News: “Millions of Americans urged to lick Homer Simpson.” Not only is it a bizarre image, but most American stamps are now self-adhesive.

Anticipating Conan O’Brien’s summer transition to the “Tonight” show, when he’ll be rejoined by his longtime second banana, Andy Richter, Slate’s Troy Patterson declares Mr. Richter “the best late-night-show sidekick of all time,” writing: “Too square to be hip, too well-kempt for slob comedy, and too principled to pander, Richter exudes a normalness that renders him a misfit. But, though as wholesome as Garrison Keillor on the surface, he is as weird as anybody. In the moments that require his zaniest self, he suggests a subtle Chris Farley, with the crucial difference of seeming to prefer malted milkshakes to speedballs.”

And, since we suspect we won’t have it to kick around for much longer, here’s a highlight reel from the new Fox variety show “Osbournes: Reloaded,” which had its 25-minute premiere after “American Idol” on Tuesday night:
