The official, Wladyslaw Baka, a Politburo member and the Central Committee Secretary responsible for the economy, was asked about the possible return of Solidarity, and he replied, ''I cannot exclude that it is going to happen, and it probably will.''

He added, however, that a ''reconstruction of the Solidarity structure seems unlikely.''

Mr. Baka said he expected that new labor legislation would permit Solidarity leaders to organize at the factory level, but that national links among factories would be forbidden, as would the union's transformation ''into a political party.''

Today was the eighth anniversary of the signing of the main accord approving the formation of Solidarity, the first independent trade union in the East bloc. The accord was approved after a wave of domestic unrest and nationwide strikes. One of the charges leveled against Solidarity when martial law was declared 15 months later was that the union threatened to become a political party and challenge the Communinst Party's monopoly on power.

In the statement read to the workers, Mr. Walesa said he had ''accepted further talks with the central authorities.''

''I proposed therefore that we break off the present strike activity,'' he said.

The Solidarity leader then issued an appeal to strikers ''for the effective ending of negotiations on other demands, and the suspension of the strikes.''

Mr. Walesa said that in today's talks, he had put forward ''what is at this moment the most important topic of discussion, the road leading to the realization of trade union pluralism and, in that context, Solidarity.''

''Those taking part in the talks,'' he said, ''recognized that all issues relating to the trade union movement would be discussed by the round table.'' Cooperation Is Stressed
