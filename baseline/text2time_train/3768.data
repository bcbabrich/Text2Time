Tying the team with the worst record in the National Hockey League should be disturbing for the Devils. But it was not to Coach Jacques Lemaire.

''I feel that we played well enough to win tonight and we had a chance to win, but their goaltender came up with good saves, especially toward the end,'' Lemaire said tonight after the Toronto Maple Leafs rallied for a 3-3 tie. ''People say these are last-place teams, but how much better are we from these teams?''

Toronto came into Continental Arena with only two victories in its previous 12 games, the only team in the league without a tie all season and a team that failed to earn a point when trailing after two periods.

The Maple Leafs changed all that after Todd Warriner scored the only goal in the third period when his shot from the slot beat Martin Brodeur under the glove, 5 minutes 21 seconds into the third.
