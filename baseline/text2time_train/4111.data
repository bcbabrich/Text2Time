Henry Kraus, the first editor of the United Automobile Workers' national newspaper, a labor historian, an authority on European art and a recipient of a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, died on Friday in Paris, where he had lived since 1956. He was 89.

The cause was cancer, said his wife, Dorothy.

Mr. Kraus's seventh and most recent book, "Heroes of Unwritten Story," a personal history of the U.A.W. from 1934 to 1939, was published last year by the University of Illinois Press.

Acclaimed as a chronicler of the American labor movement, Mr. Kraus was also celebrated for his studies of medieval art, which led to such books, sometimes written with his wife, as "The Living Theater of Medieval Art," "Hidden World of Misericords," "Gothic Stalls of Spain" and "Gold Was the Mortar: The Economics of Cathedral Building."

In 1984, Mr. Kraus received a five-year MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, often described as a genius grant, which helped him return to Michigan to conduct research for "Heroes of Unwritten Story" at the labor archives at Wayne State University in Detroit.
