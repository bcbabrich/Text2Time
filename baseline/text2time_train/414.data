Season 1, Episode 5: ‘The Race Card’

What starts as an episode built around the Los Angeles Police Department’s history of racism against African-American citizens ends with an image of a prominent officer polishing a curio cabinet full of Nazi memorabilia. There’s no nuance here — Ryan Murphy and company are going deep on the way race completely upended the O.J. trial.

It was interesting to have this episode start with a flashback to 1982, as Johnnie Cochran gets pulled over while driving his two young daughters to dinner. He comically coaches them as the officer walks toward the car:

“What do we say to the police?” “Nothing!” “And who talks to the police?” “Our lawyer!”

But it’s no joke when he’s dragged out of his car, handcuffed and left on the hood while the officer checks his credentials simply for asking why he’s been pulled over for the third time this month. The scene seems to ask: If an assistant district attorney can get handcuffed just for driving a Mercedes in a nice neighborhood, can you imagine how the police are treating the rest of Los Angeles’s African-American population? When he’s uncuffed and sits in the driver’s seat, one of his daughters asks if the officer called him a racial epithet, only to have Cochran soulfully answer: “No, he didn’t. He didn’t have to.”

This scene matters more after we see Cochran in 1995 using race as the core of his strategy to free his client. He deftly deploys a number of strategies. He hosts a news conference at a black church where he receives tons of prayers and support from the clergy; he publicly says that Darden was only brought to the table because he’s black; and, most shockingly, he calls Darden a “Mark Fuhrman apologist” when Darden tries to get the officer’s prior racist statements deemed inadmissible, arguing that the inflammatory “n-word” would blind jurors to the truth. As Cochran is walking away from the podium, he turns to Darden, looks him right in the eyes, and says a racial epithet under his breath. It’s a moment that codifies Cochran’s previous statement to Darden — he’s not trying to be respectful, he’s trying to win.

That becomes abundantly clear when Cochran remodels O.J.’s home as a bastion to black history ahead of the jury visit, removing photos of half-naked women, football posters and pictures of the star alongside his white buddies and replacing them with African folk art and the 1964 Norman Rockwell painting “The Problem We All Live With,” featuring a 6-year-old Ruby Bridges walking to her newly desegregated school. By elevating O.J.’s blackness, Cochran is hoping to bury the facts that make him look guilty, like the trail of blood that leads from the crime scene to O.J.’s car and bedroom. When O.J. enters the scene, he comments that the people in the pictures “aren’t even his kids.”
