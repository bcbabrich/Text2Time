Maureen Donovan of Onoway, Alberta, warmed the hearts of Wal-Mart executives last month: she was the 50th Canadian to send in a petition begging the mass retailer to open a store nearby.

''It would be a dream come true to have a rural Wal-Mart in Onoway,'' Ms. Donovan wrote from her acreage near that farming village of some 800 people, an hour's drive northwest of Edmonton. Ms. Donovan, a network planner for Canada Post who described herself as a ''longtime Wal-Mart customer,'' tossed in the suggestion that she be considered as the new store's first manager.

Similarly, Carol Foote, a caregiver in Miramichi, New Brunswick, a city of some 19,000 people, organized a petition for a Wal-Mart last fall in the hope that its drawing power would help lift the local economy. ''Our city is not growing because there's nothing to draw people here,'' Ms. Foote said in a telephone interview. If people from surrounding areas came to shop at a Wal-Mart, ''maybe that night they'd go to the theater before they went home.'' With the help of two friends, Ms. Foote collected 11,276 signatures in six weeks.

Such pleas are evidence of a remarkable shift in attitude toward Wal-Mart Stores, the world's biggest retailer, since its first foray into Canada seven years ago.
