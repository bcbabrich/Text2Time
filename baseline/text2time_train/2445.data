To the Editor:

Like the majority of New York City residents, I do not own a car. When I need to take motorized transportation, I take a cab or subway or bus, and I have to pay for it every day of the week.

The City Council's vote to restore free Sunday parking (news article, July 28) is a handout to the minority of car owners.

Why should car owners be allowed to take up precious city real estate free of charge?

Free parking just encourages more driving. The streets of New York are crowded enough. We need the City Council to help relieve traffic congestion, not add to it.
