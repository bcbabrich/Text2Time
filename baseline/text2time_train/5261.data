The new ''Mikado'' - which will shortly be seen in Los Angeles with Dudley Moore in Mr. Idle's place - startled the British press and public by throwing out the usual Japanese trappings in favor of a British hotel lobby of the late 1920's, complete with a monochromaticaly dressed cast straight out of a Marx Brothers film. Mr. Miller's aim was to bring Gilbert's burlesque of English manners closer to our time by changing the setting to something more recognizable to modern audiences. Detractors thought the change just as arbitrary and gimmicky as Mr. Miller's ''Rigoletto'' resetting in New York's Little Italy, another production done for the E.N.O., and others pointed out that the spectacle of japonaiserie was part of the thrill of ''The Mikado,'' whether in 1885 or a century later.

On the recording, the sets and costumes are immaterial, and those seeking any revisionist reading of Gilbert's lyrics or Sullivan's score will find very few changes. They will find just over an hour of music, left untouched and sung nicely, and a new set of lyrics for Ko-Ko's ''little list'' song. These, written by Mr. Idle and Mr. Miller (and published by Kay-Gee-Bee Music), attempt a mild offensiveness in the Monty Python mode. During his lifetime, Gilbert sanctioned encore verses - written by himself - and it might have been a good idea to have let Mr. Idle do the originals first. (In performance, there is a new overture of no great interest, which has not been included here.) Of the singers, I enjoyed Felicity Palmer as Katisha; some may find Bonaventura Bottone's Nanki-Poo just too-too in its exaggerated 1920's musical-comedy tone. By releasing only highlights, the original British record company seems to have judged that the public would want just a souvenir of this picturesque production, rather than a musically complete version.

The new ''Ruddigore'' is a different matter, being more complete than any previous version of the operetta. In the days that followed the badly received premiere of that operetta, Gilbert and Sullivan made quite a few cuts and changes, mostly in the problematic second act, in which a chorus of ghosts not only step out of their picture frames, but marry the female chorus at the work's conclusion. This distasteful finale was replaced (although one of the dead baronets still teams up with his former sweetheart) and the offending ''y'' in ''Ruddygore'' was changed to an ''i'' at a time when ''ruddy'' or ''bloody'' were too much for family audiences.

In spite of these alterations, a respectable eight-month London run and various tours, the operetta sank into a ghostly oblivion. When it finally was revived in London in 1921, two D'Oyly Carte musical directors had made numerous ''improvements'' on Sullivan's original manuscript, and another, Malcolm Sargent, added his own thoughts a few seasons later.

Surprisingly, many of these emendations improved ''Ruddigore'' - the 1920's overture (like the original, not arranged by Sullivan) is more exciting, the ghost scene is thrillingly condensed, discarding a dull dead march and some weary choral responses, as well as two attempts at a patter song right after the ghost scene that were simply ineffective. On the other hand, certain cuts restored in this recording are delightful, particularly the original finale (''When a Man Has Been a Naughty Baronet''), missing second verses, and the charming love duet in Act I (''The Battle's Roar Is Over''). One also gets to hear the melodrame in Act II involving a dagger, but this would have been more effective with the dialogue it is supposed to accompany.
