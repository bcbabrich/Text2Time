Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth yesterday suspended for one year Keith Hernandez of the Mets, Dale Berra of the Yankees and five other major league players for cocaine use. However, Mr. Ueberroth offered to lift the suspensions if the players agreed to certain conditions, including contributing 10 percent of their salaries this year to programs to combat drug abuse and submitting to drug tests for the remainder of their careers.

Four other players were suspended for 60 days, with the bans to be lifted if they give 5 percent of their salaries to drug programs and agree to testing.

The commissioner also said he would require 10 other players to undergo testing for the remainder of their careers because of past use of cocaine. These 10 are not to be penalized. Reason for Suspensions Any of the players involved who have positive tests for cocaine, marijuana, morphine or heroin would automatically be subject to the suspension, Mr. Ueberroth said. Similarly, those who refuse to be tested would be subject to the suspensions, which would be effective opening day. Those suspended would not be paid.

The one-year suspensions were handed out to those players who Mr. Ueberroth said had not only used drugs themselves but had also ''in some fashion facilitated the distribution of drugs in baseball.'' He said these players had shared drugs with teammates and in some cases introduced players to drug dealers.
