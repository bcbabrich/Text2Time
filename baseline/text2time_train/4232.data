Ian Miller, the president and chief operating officer of Tatham Euro RSCG in Chicago, and one of three managing partners, has resigned from the agency after five years, effective immediately.

"Ian did not see eye to eye with Euro RSCG about his role in the organization," Ralph Rydholm, chairman and chief executive of Tatham, said yesterday, referring to the agency's parent in Paris.

Ian is a good guy with a ton of good background," he added, but Mr. Miller "would have preferred to move up at Tatham, and that was not going to be the case in the near future." Mr. Miller, 45, could not be reached for comment; Mr. Rydholm said Mr. Miller was traveling in Australia.

The trade publication Adweek reported on Oct. 16 that relations between Mr. Miller and executives of Euro RSCG had been strained. The Chicago Tribune reported on Monday that Mr. Miller and Euro RSCG had hired lawyers to try to settle an unspecified dispute.
