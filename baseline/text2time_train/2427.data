"They are a mystery," he said. "We have shown them to a lot of people, to identify the sculptor, without success. The use of lead points to a Northern European origin. The marble would seem to indicate Italy. It's likely a meeting of different schools. They may have been done by Italian sculptors working in Paris."

Until now, the blackamoors stood on the landing of the grand staircase of the palatial Lisbon town house of Antonio de Sommer Champalimaud, a Portuguese businessman and banker. "Part of the excitement of the sale is that people have never been to the house; no one knew what was there," Mr. Rock said. "He rebuilt an entire house behind an old facade right in the middle of Lisbon on top of a hill."

Before the Portuguese revolution of 1974, Champalimaud owned cement factories, iron mills and steel works in Portugal and was a major shareholder in Banco Pinto & Sottomayor. In 1974, the government nationalized his companies and he suffered huge losses. He moved to Brazil and started a cement industry there.

In the 1990's, he returned to Portugal and systematically bought back his former companies, one by one. He died last year at 86, leaving a $3 billion fortune. He left $908 million and his art collections to the Champalimaud Foundation for medical research in Portugal, which he had founded. The sale, expected to raise $25 million to $36 million, has more than 200 lots of signed French furniture, antique boiseries, porcelain, bronzes and oil paintings (including a large Canaletto painting of Venice that is expected to go for Â£5 million).

One of the great attractions of the sale is a complete room of beautifully carved antique boiseries painted pale gray. Champalimaud hired Jansen, the prestigious Paris decorating firm, to design his Lisbon house, and presumably it was Jansen that acquired this set of Louis XVI carved oak panels made in about 1775. The most important pieces have bas-reliefs representing four continents: an alligator symbolizing America; a lion, Africa; a stallion, Europe; and the camel, Asia.
