Mr. Shapiro tried to trip up the witness by asking him whether he had seen the limousine driver who had in fact shown up at Mr. Simpson's house only after Mr. Cale had gone to bed.

The defense lawyer also noted that the Bronco was really only a few inches from the curb, not the 18 inches Mr. Cale said it was.

"I don't think it's a paragon of parallel parking," the witness insisted. Mr. Simpson glared stonily at his neighbor as he testified.

Mr. Cale said that although he had been following a case a bit, it was only earlier this year that he realized the position of the Bronco was an issue in it. He conceded, however, that he paid particular attention to Mr. Simpson's house.

"Mr. Simpson is a celebrity, certainly one of the most well-known people in the neighborhood," said the witness, a self-employed private investor, and Mr. Simpson's house was "a focal point" in the neighborhood, particularly when it is decorated with Christmas lights.

Anxious to miss the media blitzkrieg unleashed even on bit players in the Simpson drama, Mr. Cale would not give his address. He said only that it took him only three or four minutes to return home from his walk, "depending upon what the dog was doing." That brought laughs from a few jurors.

In his statement to the police last June, Mr. Simpson equivocated on when he last used the Bronco. Initially, he said that he had last used it "in the morning, in the afternoon," and that once he returned from his daughter's dance recital around 6:30 P.M., he did not go out in it again.
