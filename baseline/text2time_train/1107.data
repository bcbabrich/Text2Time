National signing day has turned into a made-for-television affair, with recruits selecting their universities’ caps before crowds of friends and family members and an audience at home. The 2012 version of this annual rite yielded a few additional themes.

The strong recruiting classes signed by Ohio State and Miami on Wednesday showed that prospects are willing to overlook N.C.A.A. sanctions (or the threat of penalties, in Miami’s case) if the coach can sell the program.

Alabama, the national champion, hauled in what was regarded as the nation’s best class. Texas, Florida, Florida State and Michigan were among the other top finishers, recruiting experts said.

Although recruits might overlook sanctions, they were much less forgiving of the off-field issues at Penn State, where the impact of the child sexual-abuse scandal involving the former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky was felt in a recruiting class that came undone.

Here is a closer look at some of signing day’s winners and losers.

Winners

OHIO STATE Urban Meyer was able to turn other programs’ misfortune into good fortune for the Buckeyes. A little more than two months after taking over as the Ohio State coach, Meyer attracted one of the nation’s best classes.

“He’s a great counterpuncher,” said Tom Lemming, a recruiting analyst for CBS Sports. “He took four recruits from Penn State, one from Notre Dame and one from Michigan State. He took advantage of others teams’ problems and did what he does best: recruit.”

Among the top recruits to sign with Ohio State were the prized defensive end Noah Spence, who once favored Penn State, and the 300-pound defensive tackle Tommy Schutt, who switched his commitment from Penn State.

Ohio State was also able to scoop up many top in-state prospects, even though the program was put on N.C.A.A. probation in December.

MISSOURI The Tigers signed this year’s consensus best player: receiver Dorial Green-Beckham, who played in high school in nearby Springfield, Mo. Green-Beckham is a needed pickup for Coach Gary Pinkel as Missouri prepares to enter the Southeastern Conference this fall. At 6 feet 6 inches, Green-Beckham has been likened to Randy Moss, and he reportedly caught 119 passes for 2,233 yards and 24 touchdowns during his senior year.

MIAMI Despite the threat of sanctions against his program, Al Golden was able to lure top players to Miami while also keeping many of the elite local prospects at home. Golden has done particularly well in talent-rich Miami-Dade and Broward Counties, recruiting the elite defensive back Tracy Howard of Miramar, Fla., who chose Miami rather than Florida or Florida State.

Losers

PENN STATE A brutal signing day was the latest fallout from the scandal that led to the firing of Joe Paterno as coach. The Nittany Lions were poised to haul in one of the nation’s best classes. But after the scandal broke in November, they saw an exodus of top prospects that continued all the way up until Wednesday, when the Philadelphia quarterback Skyler Mornhinweg signed with Florida. Several other top recruits switched their commitments to Ohio State.

What further damaged Penn State was its protracted coaching search and the inability of its new coach, Bill O’Brien, to devote time to keeping the class intact. O’Brien has continued to serve as the offensive coordinator for the New England Patriots, who play in the Super Bowl on Sunday.

“If O’Brien had been recruiting all January, he would have been able to save some of the guys,” Lemming said. “But him being away from State College hurt them.”

CALIFORNIA A poor signing-day performance for California illustrated the importance of one deft assistant coach. The Golden Bears’ promising class fell to pieces after Tosh Lupoi, one of the nation’s top recruiters, left in January to become a defensive coach at Washington.

Three potential gems of Cal’s class — safety Shaq Thompson, defensive tackle Ellis McCarthy and receiver Jordan Payton — switched their commitments after Lupoi left. McCarthy and Payton signed with U.C.L.A. Thompson signed with Washington.

“It shows you he’s a bit of a pied piper,” Lemming said of Lupoi. “He’s the best recruiter in the country as far as assistants go. They had one of the best classes in the country, but they’ve been dropping rapidly.”

LOUISIANA STATE L.S.U. was unable to parlay its trip to the national title game into a strong signing day. The Tigers failed to attract many top in-state prospects, with Alabama and other programs invading and plundering elite talent.
