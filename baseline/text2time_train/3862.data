McGwire, who has homered with more frequency than any major leaguer in history other than Babe Ruth, had to approve the deal, as was his right because he has at least 10 years of major league service, the last five with the same team. It was obviously worth it to the first baseman to not only leave the rubble of a now-collapsed A's dynasty, but also to reunite with his former A's manager, Tony La Russa, in St. Louis.

McGwire said: ''It's not an easy decision. But I think you come to a crossroads in your life where change is good for you.''

The McGwire deal, rumored for days, was expected. But nothing the White Sox have done this week could have been predicted, considering the team was only three and a half games behind the first-place Cleveland Indians in the eminently winnable American League Central.

Yet the club that once invested heavily in its pursuit of the Indians by signing Albert Belle to a five-year, $55 million deal last winter, traded away its most effective pitcher in Alvarez (9-8, 3.03 e.r.a.). It also traded one of the league's premier stoppers in Hernandez as well as Darwin (4-8, 4.13 e.r.a.) just days after dealing Harold Baines, a .305 hitter, to Baltimore.

No less than Brian Sabean, the Giants' general manager, admitted being amazed to be able to engineer such a deal for such pitchers, saying last night, ''Once you sit back and see the quality of the three players, let alone put them in one deal, it is pretty unique.''

White Sox General Manager Ron Schueler, speaking by telephone from Chicago, rejected the notion that his club has conceded the division because of financial concerns that date back to the loss of pitcher Alex Fernandez to free agency last winter.

''I don't ever give up,'' Schueler said. ''But what I saw was a club that I felt I had given four months, but we didn't perform as good as I thought they would. We weren't even at the .500 mark and I wasn't at the point where I thought I could go out and add a lot of dollars to make it better,'' added Schueler, who shed $10 million in salaries in two deals this week.
