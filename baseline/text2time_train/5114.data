Big-time college sports recruiters have long found a rich source of talent in community colleges. Now, after a decade of decline in black enrollment and graduation rates, academic recruiters at four-year schools are finding that community colleges may also be a source of academic talent. It's a trend that deserves encouragement; creditably, the Ford Foundation is offering some.

The foundation last week announced a $1.2 million grant to help 25 urban community colleges and an equal number of four-year institutions develop partnerships to guide black and other minority group students through the transfer process and to bachelor's degrees.

In 1986, according to the American Council on Education, 43 percent of all black students in higher education were in two-year schools. By comparison, only 36 percent of whites were. If it were not for the existence of historically black four-year colleges, the proportion of blacks in two-year institutions would undoubtedly have been higher.

In one sense, this heavy minority presence in community colleges is good. It indicates the schools are what they were intended to be: providers of a cheap, easily accessible foothold on a college degree.
