Britain and six Southeast Asian nations plan a new attempt to persuade the Bush Administration and the Vietnamese Government to agree to the forced return of thousands of Vietnamese boat people later this summer.

The six Asian nations are warning that unless the forcible repatriation is accepted, they will no longer allow boat people to land, and an international plan for looking after these refugees will collapse.

The diplomatic campaign, which diplomats say will involve high level appeals in Washington and Hanoi next month is intended to secure American and Vietnamese backing for the return of boat people who are deemed to be economic migrants rather than political refugees by July 1.

Asians Present an Ultimatum

This deadline was set at a meeting in Manila earlier this month of the 29 countries that drew up the Comprehensive Plan of Action on Indochinese Refugees at a United Nations-sponsored conference in Geneva last year. If the United States and Vietnam agree, these countries will meet again in Geneva on June 26 to prepare the repatriation.
