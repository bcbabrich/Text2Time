For a generation, Indonesian journalists knew better than to write about business and government corruption. The country's dictator, Suharto, would close down the publication and throw the editor or reporter in jail.

The dictator is gone -- five years now -- and news organizations are still trying to find their role in a democracy, at times indulging in unbridled excess. But in a country that is widely viewed by the World Bank and foreign businessmen as among the most corrupt, the rich and powerful have a new tactic in their battle against the press: libel actions.

The latest verdict, in late January, stunned many Indonesians. A court ordered one of the country's most respected newspapers, Koran Tempo, to pay $1 million to a prominent businessman, Tomy Winata.

The judges said the newspaper had insulted Mr. Winata by suggesting that he had sought a casino license in one province and might be looking at another location for one. Gambling is illegal here.
