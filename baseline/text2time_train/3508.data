Standing on a ballroom stage in Las Vegas, Nev., earlier this year, Herman Cain, president of the National Restaurant Association, sang to his members, crooning in a rich baritone: ''If I can see it, I can do it; if I just believe, there's nothing to it.

''I believe I can fly; I believe I can touch the sky!''

Not surprisingly, the unusual performance from the industry's top lobbyist raised a few eyebrows among the restaurateurs in the audience, who were there for an association convention. But in truth, Mr. Cain had reason to crow, because the restaurant industry is flush.

Americans are eating out more often than ever before. Average check prices are higher than they have ever been. More than 10.2 million people are employed in restaurants, more than at any time in the past. And total industry sales are expected to reach a record high this year, $354 billion.

And yet, association lobbyists managed to convince House Republicans this summer that restaurants were suffering enduring harm from the Government's decision in 1993 to reduce the tax deductibility of business meals, to 50 percent from 80 percent. The House tax cut bill, passed earlier this month, includes a heavily lobbied provision that raises it back to 80 percent. The tax bill that passed the Senate on Friday does not contain the provision, meaning more lobbying lies ahead.
