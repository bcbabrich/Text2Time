Just when despair was kicking in, the roles came: a loopy spin instructor on “Broad City,” an acting student on “Barry” and a lead role as Janet on “The Good Place,” in which she plays opposite Kristen Bell and Ted Danson. (Coordinating the shooting schedules for multiple comedies is no joke.)

Working on a fizzily optimistic show like “The Good Place” is “healthy for me,” Ms. Carden said. “It’s about imperfect people trying to be better.”

After finishing her tea, Ms. Carden took out her iPhone to show Ms. Perr some of the designs she liked. (The phone had a picture of Timothée Chalamet on the home screen. “I thought I’d do Chalamet across my chest,” she joked.)

“This one spoke to my brain the most,” she said, pointing to a cent symbol haloed by diamonds, though Ms. Carden wanted a topper of three dots instead, to represent “Me, Jason and Penny,” she said.

Ms. Perr uploaded the design to her computer, tweaked it and then sent it to a printer. In the meantime, she had Ms. Carden sign a liability waiver. “Are you trying to scare me?” Ms. Carden said.

With the stencil in hand, the two women stood in front of a full-length mirror to figure out where the tattoo should go. They quickly decided on the area beneath Ms. Carden’s right wrist bone, which would be a slight hassle for the makeup artists on “The Good Place,” but until Janet gets a tattoo upgrade, that’s that.
