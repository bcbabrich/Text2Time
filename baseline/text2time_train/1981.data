“Tea and Sympathy,” the Robert Anderson play about a lonely, misunderstood boarding-school boy that opened on Broadway in 1953 and ran for more than 700 performances, will be revived by the Keen Company as the final production of its season.

Previews begin on March 6, with an official opening scheduled for March 15. The limited engagement runs through April 14 at the Harold Clurman Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton.
