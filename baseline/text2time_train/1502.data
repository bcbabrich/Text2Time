The surprise of the Montreal Canadiens’ seven-game opening-round victory over the Washington Capitals, the N.H.L.’s best regular-season team, resonated in some unlikely places, from the Web sites of Businessweek and Dubai’s Gulf News to National Public Radio.

Montreal was led by the remarkable play of goalie Jaroslav Halak, whom the Capitals star Alex Ovechkin chided after Game 2, telling reporters that Halak’s hand was shaking after surrendering a goal.

Halak composed himself well enough to stop 131 of 134 shots in the final three games, and for the first time since the current playoff format was adopted in 1994, an eighth-seeded team rallied from a 3-1 series deficit against a No. 1 seed.

In part because the Capitals boast the charismatic Ovechkin, and in part because they finished 33 points ahead of the Canadiens in the regular season, some have called this the greatest upset in Stanley Cup play.

But four other upsets involved teams in which the points gap between the teams was larger, all before 1994. The largest, the 1982 first-round defeat of Edmonton by Los Angeles, has some significant similarities and perhaps some lessons for the offense-oriented Capitals.

The freewheeling, confident Oilers, featuring the 21-year-olds Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier, finished a whopping 48 points ahead of the Kings. But the Oilers lost in a wild five-game series that set numerous records for goals.

Most famous among them was Game 3, known among Kings fans as the Miracle on Manchester for the location of their rink on Manchester Boulevard in Inglewood, Calif. The Oilers squandered a five-goal third-period lead and lost in overtime, 6-5.

In his autobiography, Gretzky called it “the best thing that could’ve happened” to the young Oilers.

“We had gotten too big for our hockey shorts,” he wrote. “We jeered the Kings’ power-play line from the bench when we should have been yelling for more defense.”

In two years, the Oilers would be a bit more reserved and better defensively on their way to winning the Stanley Cup. Critics would argue that modesty and defense were also in short supply among this season’s Capitals.

The 1991 Minnesota North Stars pulled off two playoff upsets. They knocked off the Chicago Blackhawks, who finished 38 points better, in the first round, and the St. Louis Blues, who finished 37 points better, in the second round, en route to the Cup finals. They lost to Pittsburgh in the finals.

Montreal also scored a big upset in 1951 by defeating Detroit in the first round, even though the Red Wings finished 36 points ahead during the season.

The Canadiens have been involved in a few other memorable outcomes. They knocked off the Bobby Orr-led Big Bad Bruins in seven games in the first round of the 1971 playoffs, even though they finished 24 points behind Boston during the season. They had an unheralded goalie in that series as well, Ken Dryden, who would backstop them to the Cup that year and five other times before the end of the decade.

Montreal was on the other end of a first-round loss in 1961. The powerhouse Canadiens had held the Cup five straight seasons and finished first in the regular season for the fourth straight year, and their 92 points were 17 better than the Blackhawks, who had not won a playoff series in 17 years.

Four Canadiens were among the league’s top 10 in scoring. The Blackhawks had no one among the top scorers and had 56 fewer goals. But they had Glenn Hall in goal, and he outplayed his Montreal counterpart, Jacques Plante, shutting out the Canadiens in the final two games.

Chicago went on to capture the Stanley Cup, the Blackhawks’ first Stanley Cup since 1938. They have yet to win another.

Even Sadder Than Cubs

When the Detroit Red Wings beat Phoenix, 6-1, in Game 7 of their opening-round series last Tuesday, it was the 12th consecutive series defeat for the Coyotes dating to 1987, when they were the Winnipeg Jets.

That is the longest playoff losing streak in major league sports in North America. The Chicago Cubs are next, having dropped 10 consecutive series from 1910-98.

Since joining the N.H.L. in 1979, the Coyotes/Jets franchise is 2-17 in playoff series.

But some solace: as the Jets, they won the World Hockey Association championship three times in the league’s seven-season existence.

End of a Russian Era

Ak Bars Kazan repeated as champions of Russia with a seven-game victory in the Gagarin Cup finals. Ak Bars Kazan, from Tatarstan, lifted the trophy for the second straight year after posting a 2-0 win on the road against HK MVD Balashikha in suburban Moscow on Tuesday.

HK MVD, meanwhile, will merge with the bankrupt giants Dynamo Moscow to form the team, United Hockey Club Dynamo, according to reports.

Dynamo Moscow and HK MVD each have roots as clubs representing the Interior Ministry.

Correction: May 9, 2010

Because of an editing error, a report in the Slap Shot hockey column last Sunday about the Phoenix Coyotes’ string of 12 consecutive defeats in N.H.L. playoff series misstated the year the franchise, formerly the Winnipeg Jets, joined the league. It was 1979, not 1971.
