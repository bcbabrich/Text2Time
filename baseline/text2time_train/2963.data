The roots of today's disk-drive industry can largely be traced back to work originally done in the 1950's.

While he was at I.B.M., Dr. Bajorek was a key member of the team of researchers that during the 1970's developed the basic magneto-resistive recording and sensing-head technology that is the basis of modern disk drives. For his contribution, he was awarded the Reynold B. Johnson Information Storage Award by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers this year.

Today, a more refined version of the writing and reading heads that descended from Dr. Bajorek's research ''fly'' over the disk surface at a height of about 150 angstroms (an angstrom is roughly the width of a single hydrogen atom). The tolerances are even more remarkable given that hard disk drives are rapidly becoming a staple of consumer products like Apple Computer's iPod music players, which are handled with little awareness of the delicate machine that stores digital data.

The surface of the Komag disk itself is composed of nine separate layers that sit on an aluminum platter. The data itself is organized in three layers of nickel phosphorus shielded by two layers of a diamond-like carbon material. Currently, the magnetic ones and zeros are aligned end-to-end in concentric tracks. By 2004, Dr. Bajorek believes, the industry will need to begin stacking the tiny magnetic domains perpendicularly to squeeze them more tightly onto the surface of the disk media.

Progress in disk-drive storage in recent years has been made by pushing back what the industry refers to as the ''superparamagnetic limit,'' the size at which the magnetic spots are so small that their magnetic fields can no longer be kept stable at room temperature. Last year, I.B.M. announced it had begun to use new materials the company referred to as ''pixie dust'' to push back the limit.

In contrast, Dr. Bajorek said Komag had been able to achieve the same densities without resorting to new materials. That will offer a significant cost savings in the next two generations of disk media. ''We were blessed with conventional designs that were more thermally stable,'' he said.

The company is less blessed in terms of competition. Although Komag is the only remaining independent supplier of disk media in the United States, both I.B.M., during its transition to Hitachi, and Seagate will continue to manufacture disks for their own products. And although industry executives said Komag was having some luck in pursuing both companies as customers, internationally it faces three competitors in Japan and a fourth in Taiwan.
