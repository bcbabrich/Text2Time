Staked to a 3-0 lead before he stepped on the mound, Jake Arrieta started things off by striking out Carlos Santana on just four pitches. He retired Jason Kipnis on a grounder to second base, but then walked Francisco Lindor on seven pitches. He recovered to strike out Mike Napoli to end the inning. Arrieta appeared fired up, but while the broadcast crew talked about his pitches reaching 97 m.p.h. (perhaps based on radar guns used by television stations that often get much higher readings than the ones used by scouts), M.L.B.’s Pitch F/X data had him throwing only one pitch as fast as 95, with most of his fastballs being 92 or 93.

David Waldstein: The Indians brought in 95-year-old Eddie Robinson, the last surviving member of the 1948 Indians championship team. Robinson played first base and knocked in the winning run in Game 6 of that Series. He was asked if he ever thinks about how much Bob Feller and Bob Lemon, who started Game 6, would earn if they pitched today.

“I think about Eddie Robinson and what he could have gotten,” he replied.

Top of 2nd: Tomlin Settles Down

Jason Heyward jumped on the first pitch he saw and hit a flyball to right that fell into Lonnie Chisenhall’s glove. Javier Baez hit a grounder up the middle that Jason Kipnis came across second base to field before throwing across his body to get the out at first. Dexter Fowler then hit a soft popup to Chisenehall to end the half-inning.

David Waldstein: The average velocity of balls coming off the bat against Tomlin (known as exit velocity to seamheads) was about 90 miles per hour for much of the season, but in the postseason it was down to 82 m.p.h. as Tomlin’s curveball improved. That differential looked like it was played out between the first and second innings.

Bottom of 2nd: Arrieta Cruises Through Indians’ Lineup

Jake Arrieta absolutely steamrolled the Indians in the second inning. He struck out Jose Ramirez and Lonnie Chisenhall before getting Coco Crisp to ground out to third for the third out.

David Waldstein: Arrieta looks sharp, but bear in mind he was staked to a three-run lead in a division series start against the Giants, and the Cubs lost that game. There are an extraordinary number of Cubs fans here at Progressive Field, and they are in full voice early.
