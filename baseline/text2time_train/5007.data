With prayers and admonitions from Pope John Paul II, 238 Roman Catholic bishops from around the world convened today for a synod to study the ''identity crisis'' and ''burnout'' said to be afflicting many of their priests.

For the next month, the bishops will meet at the Vatican almost daily to examine the selection and training of priests in a church plagued by a serious shortage of clergymen.

But church leaders have made clear that a few fundamental aspects of the problem are off-limits to debate, notably the Catholic requirement of priestly celibacy and the prohibition against ordaining women and married men. Repeatedly, John Paul has left no doubt that these rules will remain intact during his papacy.

If anything, Vatican officials said, the subject of celibacy should arise at the bishops' conference only in the context of how to reinforce the regulation. Their goal would be to help seminary students and priests overcome, as one senior official put it, ''any hidden frailties, poor motivation or deep resistance'' that they may have.
