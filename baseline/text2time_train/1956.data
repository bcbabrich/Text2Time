Tennessee may need to buy a 30-minute ad in prime time to introduce itself to the country as the N.F.L.’s best team. After pulling away for a convincing win over the Colts on Monday, the Titans (7-0) have a two-game lead in the A.F.C. and a four-game lead in their division. But they are on a short week as the Packers (4-3), coming off a bye, have had two weeks to heal and prepare. Throw in the fact that these two teams last played four years ago, and this game is dangerous for Tennessee.

The Titans’ hallmark has been their defensive line and run stoppers, led by Albert Haynesworth and Kyle Vanden Bosch, but their pass defense is not a pushover; it is ranked fourth in the N.F.L. and is leading the A.F.C. with 12 interceptions. It does not give up big plays, it is tied for the league lead at 5.7 yards a pass. That might take Green Bay’s deep threats out of the game.

But Green Bay’s Aaron Rodgers is actually playing better since injuring his shoulder. Playing hurt for his past three games, he has completed 71 percent of his passes, with 6 touchdown passes, an interception and a 108.5 passer rating.

Line: Titans by 4 1/2

PATRIOTS (5-2) at COLTS (3-4)

Colts by 6

Perhaps the prime example of this season’s reshuffling of the deck is the state of the New England Patriots and the Indianapolis Colts heading into their game Sunday night. For the past few years, this game has been a highlight of the regular-season schedule. But these rivals may have trouble recognizing each other this year. The Patriots’ offense, after all, is led by Matt Cassel and Kevin Faulk. And this is the first time since October 2001 that one of the teams has had a losing record when they played.

The Colts need a win, especially with a game in Pittsburgh next week. They could look like a different team because of the expected returns of safety Bob Sanders and running back Joseph Addai. Sanders’s absence has been cited often for the struggles of the Colts’ defense, but Sanders is not a one-man miracle machine. And just the Colts’ luck: as soon as they got Sanders back, they lost starting cornerback Marlin Jackson for the season because of an injured right knee.

The Patriots are also having trouble finding healthy defensive backs, not an ideal situation when facing the Colts. New England, whose previous opponents are 19-32, is in the meat of its schedule. This game is followed by three American Football Conference East games, then a matchup with the Steelers.

Patriots-Colts may not be as glamorous as in years past, but it could still be a turning point for both teams.

COWBOYS (5-3) at GIANTS (6-1)

Giants by 9

Brad Johnson is undefeated at Giants Stadium, with a 3-0 record and a 113.1 passer rating. But the last time he started there was November 2005, a 24-21 victory with the Vikings. Johnson’s passer rating in his two starts with Dallas is 60.3, and he may be on a short leash, with Brooks Bollinger receiving snaps with the first-team offense in practice last week.

JETS (4-3) at BILLS (5-2)

Bills by 5 1/2

Trent Edwards and Brett Favre have a few things in common. They each have a penchant for fourth-quarter rallies, and they each turned the ball over three times last week. A game between such evenly matched teams could come down to turnovers. Buffalo has eight in its losses; the Jets have eight in theirs.

CARDINALS (4-3) at RAMS (2-5)

Cardinals by 3

It will be like 1999 in St. Louis as the Rams induct Dick Vermeil into their Ring of Honor and Kurt Warner returns as Arizona’s starting quarterback. This will be his first start there against his former team. Believe it or not, this game has playoff implications. The Rams, so woeful mere weeks ago, will be only one game out in the National Football Conference West if they win.

TEXANS (3-4) at VIKINGS (3-4)

Vikings by 4 1/2

October has been a nonstop performance of the Matt Schaub-Andre Johnson show. What will November hold? Johnson has four consecutive games with more than 130 receiving yards, and Houston has won three in a row for the first time. But remember September? That was the last time the Texans played on the road, where they are 0-3.

RAVENS (4-3) at BROWNS (3-4)

Browns by 1 1/2

Both offenses seem to be rounding into shape just in time for a key A.F.C. North game. With Joe Flacco more comfortable, Baltimore last week unveiled a two-quarterback package featuring Troy Smith. Cleveland has been doing fine without Kellen Winslow, but with him back, Derek Anderson has all options available against the Ravens’ patchwork secondary.

EAGLES (4-3) at SEAHAWKS (2-5)

Eagles by 6 1/2

Hey, Seneca Wallace, run! Wallace’s mobility is the reason Mike Holmgren occasionally uses him at receiver, and Wallace is going to need that fancy footwork against Jim Johnson’s defense. There may be no escape for Seattle’s pass defense against the Eagles’ potent attack, especially with defensive end Patrick Kerney out with a shoulder injury.

STEELERS (5-2) at REDSKINS (6-2)

Redskins by 2

Clinton Portis’s five-game streak of 120-yard rushing games will be put to the test by the Steelers’ third-ranked run defense. Pittsburgh’s two losses are to N.F.C. East teams.

DOLPHINS (3-4) at BRONCOS (4-3)

Broncos by 3 1/2

Denver spent its bye week trying to learn from a 41-7 loss to the Patriots. But Ronnie Brown should have a field day against the Broncos’ porous defense, which is without the Bailey brothers.

LIONS (0-7) at BEARS (4-3)

Bears by 12 1/2

In a Week 5 rout of Detroit, Kyle Orton had his best game. Chicago will have its starting cornerbacks back, which should neutralize the Lions’ one weapon, Calvin Johnson.

JAGUARS (3-4) at BENGALS (0-8)

Jaguars by 7 1/2

The Lions appear to be moving closer to a win, but the Bengals seem to be moving further.Outscored by 99-30 in its last three games, Cincinnati cannot make it to its bye week fast enough.

BUCCANEERS (5-3) at CHIEFS (1-6)

Buccaneers by 9

This appears to be a mismatch, but Tampa Bay is 1-3 on the road, where it is averaging 8 fewer points and allowing 8.5 more. Still, these are the Chiefs we’re talking about.

FALCONS (4-3) at RAIDERS (2-5)

Falcons by 3

Matt Ryan and Darren McFadden were taken third and fourth in April’s draft, but there may not be a reunion because of McFadden’s injured toes. It must be the shoes, the Raiders say.
