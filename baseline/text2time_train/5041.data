Bulgaria will hold elections in six months to replace Parliament, which has been dominated by former Prime Minister Andrei Lukanov's unpopular Socialist Party, reports today indicated. The trade union newspaper Trud quoted President Zhelyu Zhelev, a non-Communist, as saying that a May date for elections was set as part of an agreement reached between Mr. Lukanov and other political leaders before the premier resigned on Thursday.
