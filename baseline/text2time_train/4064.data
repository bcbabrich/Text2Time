In such an otherwise irreverent context, this amounts to undue pretension, since so much of the dialogue is lost and upstaged anyhow. Fortunately, this film's young lovers, played radiantly by Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio, have the requisite magic and speak their lines with passionate conviction. They remain rapt and earnest even when some of the film's frantic minor players might as well be speaking in tongues.

With an opening sequence edited in the high-voltage style of a movie trailer, this ''Romeo and Juliet'' does not initially promise much in the way of sincerity. As he introduces the Capulets and the Montagues as two warring Florida street gangs, screaming threats and driving cars with vanity plates (''CAP 005''), Mr. Luhrmann starts the film at full fever pitch. He hurls the audience into a world where clothes, graffiti, signs and billboards become Shakespearean artifacts with a touch of camp. Catherine Martin's gaudy, spectacular production design is high drama in its own right.

By the same logic that turned Juliet's balcony into a Manhattan fire escape for ''West Side Story,'' this film draws on watery settings so that its lovers can quite literally take the plunge, and it nearly turns the Capulets' costume ball into ''Priscilla, Queen of Verona.'' (Mercutio, played by Harold Perrineau, is now a black drag queen in a white wig.) Dressed to ravishing effect as a knight and an angel, Romeo and Juliet meet here and bring the film to a much-needed mood change.

The frenzy gives way to a tenderness that makes sense in any language, or with no language at all, as Mr. Luhrmann lets the camera swirl adoringly around the film's young stars. Just when ''Romeo and Juliet'' has almost fatally pushed its luck -- with the sight of Paul Sorvino raving in purple spangles as Juliet's father, say, or with many comparable affronts -- it is still able to summon flashes of purity and beauty.

Eventually switching gears too often and sinking under the weight of its random excesses, ''Romeo and Juliet'' still sustains a remarkable amount of fire. Among its more striking inventions are Sycamore Grove, where Romeo does his brooding, imagined as a seaside stage, and the banishment of Romeo to a trailer in this desert. Pete Postlethwaite, as a tattooed Father Laurence, and Miriam Margolyes, as Juliet's zesty nurse, are among the actors who successfully compete with the scenery. It's a daunting task.
