The characters in Lanford Wilson's ''Mound Builders'' are on an archeological dig in Illinois, unearthing an Indian burial ground. Audiences who visit the Circle Repertory Company's new and revised revival of Mr. Wilson's 1975 play had better plan on doing some hard digging themselves. There are some fragments of interest in ''The Mound Builders,'' but they are buried beneath mounds, if not mountains, of talk.

Indeed, this discursive drama may well separate its author's true fans from the dilettantes. First seen well after ''Lemon Sky'' (1970) and just before ''Serenading Louie'' (1976) -the two superior Wilson plays that have been treated to recent revivals at the Second Stage - ''The Mound Builders'' is best approached as a partial Rosetta Stone to the Talley plays that Mr. Wilson began, with ''5th of July,'' in 1978. Some crucial concerns of those later works are here in embryonic form, from the durability of family and civilization in a destructive modern world to the class conflict of post-World War II America. Future Wilson characters are also prefigured, and so is a setting: The rustic rented house where the archeologists summer in Blue Shoals, Ill., has the porch, screen door and insistent cricket serenade of the Talley manse in Lebanon, Mo. (The good designer, I probably needn't tell you, is once again John Lee Beatty.) But if the later plays realize Mr. Wilson's ambitions in poetic Chekhovian terms (''5th of July'') and Tennessee Williams-flecked lyricism (''Talley's Folly'') - or, failing that, Lillian Hellmanesque melodrama (''Talley and Son,'' revived by the Circle Rep this fall) - ''The Mound Builders'' is nearly all philosophical speechifying and highfalutin metaphor. While the play's half-dozen characters ostensibly represent two marriages, three families and several love triangles, their sexual, genealogical, gynecological and psychiatric histories are dropped perfunctorily and unconvincingly into amorphous college-style bull sessions. Never explored as deeply as the archeological sites nearby, Mr. Wilson's people are usually mouthpieces for authorial sermons or pawns in symbolic conflicts pitting the builders against the spoilers, the haves against the have-nots, the idealists against the cynics.

To make matters even more lugubrious, there are two simultaneous time frames, lengthy lectures about Indian anthropology, metaphysical digressions about both fire-alarm and Chinese boxes and a much-heralded Old Testament cataclysm in Act II. While some of Mr. Wilson's characteristic wisdom and humor can be found, so can lines like ''I have a real terror of gathering moss,'' ''I'm swamped with commiserations'' and ''I'm definitely sick of esthetics.'' The audience seems to nod in agreement when one character expresses ''an intense desire'' to flip to the end of a book to find out prematurely ''how it all turns out.''

Even so, the Circle Rep does deserve credit for excavating this problematic effort by its foremost playwright, if only so that students of the Wilson oeuvre can see his recent plays from another perspective. The production also initiates the company's ambitious new repertory cycle. ''The Mound Builders'' will be joined tomorrow night by Albert Camus's ''Caligula,'' and, later on, by Anne Chislett's ''Quiet in the Land.'' To accommodate a program of this scale, the company has temporarily left Greenwich Village for larger quarters at the Triplex Theater in TriBeCa.
