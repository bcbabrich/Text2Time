The majority of the 51 seats of the New York City Council were filled with fresh faces two years ago, thanks to a new term-limits law. This November the usual four-year term is shortened by half to allow for a post-census redistricting and all the seats are up for grabs again. But even abbreviated incumbency has its benefits. Only a few members of the Democrat-dominated Council face serious challenges in the Sept. 9 primary. These are The Times's endorsements for some of the most heavily contested races in Manhattan:

Eighth District (East Harlem, the Mott Haven section of the Bronx and part of the Upper West Side): The incumbent, Philip Reed, is facing a vigorous challenge from Melissa Mark-Viverito, a member of Community Board 11 in Spanish Harlem and an activist who understands issues most important to its residents. She is Puerto Rican born, an advantage in a district with a majority-Latino population.

Mr. Reed is African-American, but his Latino constituents have been among those benefiting from his Council tenure since 1998. While his most-noticed action this term was fathering the ban on cellphone use in theaters, Mr. Reed has a much fuller résumé. On workers' rights, women's rights, tenant protections and services for the elderly, his record is exemplary. In Spanish Harlem the epidemic of asthma among children is being addressed -- and is in decline -- due in part to the attention Mr. Reed won for the problem. While his Spanish admittedly is in a learning stage, Mr. Reed is fluent in the language of an effective councilman. We endorse Mr. Reed for another term on the City Council.

10th District (Washington Heights, Inwood): Miguel Martinez, the first-term incumbent, is a likable, low-key politician. But a district with desperate problems like a lack of affordable housing and severely overcrowded classrooms would benefit from an infusion of independent ideas and energy. Ydanis Rodriguez, a teacher and grass-roots organizer who has worked with immigrant children and created a local college preparatory program, has demonstrated a special kind of vitality in pressing for better services for the community. Recently, when the subway stop at 191st Street was closed for repairs through the end of the year, Mr. Rodriguez led a successful effort to get shuttle service for residents. We endorse Ydanis Rodriguez.
