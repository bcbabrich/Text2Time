Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft's chief technology officer, will take a yearlong sabbatical to pursue his own scientific research and travel, the company announced today.

Microsoft made the announcement after several news organizations, including Time magazine, reported that Mr. Myhrvold was leaving after a falling out with Microsoft's president, Steven A. Ballmer.

Microsoft executives, however, said that the reports were inaccurate and that Microsoft's co-founder and chairman, William H. Gates, said in a statement that he was looking forward to Mr. Myhrvold's return.

Mr. Myhrvold, who was the founder of Microsoft's research division, joined the company in 1986 as director of special projects.
