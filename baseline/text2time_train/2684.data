Brazil's economy grew at its fastest pace in the third quarter in eight years, lifted by surging exports and a sharp increase in domestic consumption. The government's statistics agency said that gross domestic product expanded 6.1 percent from July through September compared with the year-earlier period. The most recent performance was the fastest growth rate for the quarter since 1996. When compared with the second quarter, however, the economy grew a more modest 1 percent, slightly below most forecasts. All sectors of the economy expanded in the quarter, with exports soaring 18.2 percent from a year ago and industrial output rising 7 percent. Household consumption, meanwhile, rose 5.7 percent, the biggest increase since 1997. Brazil's economy, South America's largest, is expected to grow 4.66 percent this year. But growth is expected to slow to about 3.5 percent in 2005 as a recent increase in interest rates threatens to weigh on the economy. The government also revised last year's growth numbers, saying the economy expanded 0.54 percent in 2003 instead of shrinking 0.2 percent. Todd Benson (NYT)
