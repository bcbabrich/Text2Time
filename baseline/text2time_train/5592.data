A Federal judge yesterday revoked the $1 million bail of Angelo Ruggiero, asserting that Mr. Ruggiero ''might be a danger to society'' if he remained free while awaiting trial on heroin-trafficking charges. No date has been set for the trial.

The ruling was made by Judge Mark A. Costantino in Federal District Court in Brooklyn in connection with the August 1983 arrest of Mr. Ruggiero, whom authorities have identified as a high-ranking member of the Gambino organized-crime family.

The bail revocation request was made by Federal prosecutors after the 46-year-old Mr. Ruggiero was permitted last week to remain free on bail after his recent arrest on Federal racketeering charges.

During the earlier bail hearing on the racketeering charges, a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent testified that Mr. Ruggiero and John Gotti had engineered the murders last Dec. 16 of Paul Castellano, the reputed boss of the Gambino crime family, and his top aide, Thomas Bilotti. Authorities have said that subsequently Mr. Gotti had become the new head of the organization. Mr. Gotti is also being held without bail pending the outcome of his trial on Federal racketeering charges.
