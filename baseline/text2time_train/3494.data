IT sounded like a great idea at the time.

Ryan Harmon, a 26-year-old technology salesman in San Francisco, received an E-mail message about a company that was offering to pay people up to $20 a month for something he did every day anyway: surf the Web.

''There was no risk to sign up,'' Mr. Harmon said. ''It would really cost me nothing.''

The company, All Advantage.com, was ready to pay people who signed up 50 cents an hour for every hour that they spent on line, up to 40 hours a month. And, Mr. Harmon found out, he could make even more money by recruiting others to do the same. He could earn 10 cents for every hour that each of those referrals surfed, and 5 cents for every hour logged by people who signed up under the referrals. In fact, he could earn 5 cents for the referrals under those referrals -- and so on, down two more levels.

Mr. Harmon signed up in April and then recruited 12 people, who referred hundreds more to the company. For that, All Advantage would put as much as $600 in his pocket every month.

Since opening shop in Hayward, Calif., in late March, All Advantage has signed up more than 1.7 million members on the promise that they can get paid to surf the Web. In return, all the prospective surfers have to do is tolerate an on-screen device called the Viewbar that features paid advertising. Some members have gathered referrals so aggressively -- recruiting more than 10,000 members, in some cases -- that they claim they stand to earn thousands of dollars every month.
