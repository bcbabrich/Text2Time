Alicia de Larrocha Pianist Avery Fisher Hall

In music, patriotism has the power to enrich or to enfeeble. Reverence for homegrown tunes and dance forms has in many places reduced composers to mere arrangers. Spain at the end of the last century and for most of this one has been more fortunate. In a peculiar chemical reaction, Spanish and Catalan influences collided with a European school of virtuosity emanating from Liszt and his emulators. The result has been some of the most eruptive and extravagant music ever to visit the keyboard.

Alicia de Larrocha, who played Surinach, Mompou, Turina, Granados and Albeniz on Sunday afternoon, stands so far above all other espousers of this music that she represents a school in herself. Miss de Larrocha gave four excerpts from Albeniz's "Iberia" at the end of the afternoon. Given the fearsome performing difficulties involved, music is fortunate to have a pianist willing to risk them in public at all, and doubly blessed with one able to sail through their complications with such brilliance and devotion. There was only a small moment of confusion in "Triana" to show that Miss de Larrocha is human after all.

The "Escenas Romanticas" by Granados revealed the darker, almost threatening side of the Spanish personality and at the same time pointed to a bond with the tradition of Chopin. It is a European influence that Granados's companions on this program seemed to shun. Mr. Surinach's arrangement of his ballet suite"Acrobats of the Gods" pushed native melody to the forefront, supporting it with pedal points and mechanistic ostinatos and spicing it with clashes between unrelated keys.

The Turina "Danzas Fantasticas" weighted down Spanish folk music with elaborate ornament. The five "Canciones y Danzas" by Mompou, on the other hand, laid it bare, reducing melody to the simplest of formats and investing it with touching sincerity. BERNARD HOLLAND
