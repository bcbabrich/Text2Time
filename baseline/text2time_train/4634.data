When New York State officials auction off a winning lottery ticket today, it will take more than a dollar and a dream to walk away with the prize. How much more is the question that has been fascinating scores of potential bidders for the last two weeks, but the smart money is betting at least $2 million more.

The winner of this unusual event will receive $240,245 almost immediately, and another $3.6 million over the next 15 years. And unlike most state lotteries, which tend to attract a lower- and middle-income clientele, the auction's ground rules suggest that only the rich will be able to play: the minimum bid is $1.3 million.

At that price, a successful bidder would be locking in a long-term investment of only modest risk while earning a whopping 21.4 percent a year on the investment -- more than what far riskier investments like Old Masters, stocks and gold bullion have historically yielded. Up to $2.4 Million

But such a return is unlikely since bidders should be able to justify paying far more than $1.3 million, lawyers, accountants and other financial experts say.
