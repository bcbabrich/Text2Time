SNARING Robin Williams for the lead role of Tommy Wilhelm in Saul Bellow's novella ''Seize the Day'' must have given the producers cause for celebration. Mr. Williams is a singularly gifted comic actor and comedian, a master of dizzying improvisation. Unfortunately, his performance in ''Seize the Day'' - a ''Great Performances'' presentation on Channel 13 at 9 this evening - is a miscasting fiasco, all the more regrettable because so much intense care has been so obviously spent on the production. The lineup of established talent is impressive. Robert Geller, whose credits include public television's ''American Short Story'' series, is the executive producer. Fielder Cook is the director, and Ronald Ribman did the adaptation. A promising roster, indeed.

But despite a wealth of beautiful bits and pieces, ''Seize the Day'' fails to hold. For one thing, Mr. Williams is physically wrong. Mr. Bellow's Tommy Wilhelm, whose given name is Wilky Adler, is a big, brawny man in his mid-40's, his blond hair just beginning to go gray. If comics are required for the part, Steve Martin would have been more suitable or, better yet, the late Dick Shawn. Mr. Williams is a short, dark-haired man in his 30's who, with his pronounced mid-America accent, doesn't stand a chance of being taken for a New Yorker of Jewish background.

Worse, Mr. Williams miscalculates on the intensity of his performance. In the original story, taking place over a few days in 1956, Tommy is heading for a nervous breakdown following the loss of his salesman job and a bitter separation from his wife and two sons. With the story ''opened up'' for dramatization, Tommy is seen going through these earlier troubles. From the very first scene, though, Mr. Williams is a man falling apart, whimpering pathetically when not screwing up his face into odd contortions. There is no disintegration. He is virtually certifiable from the outset. There is no drama. Tommy is a foregone conclusion.

What's left is a scenario calculated to unsettle, possibly even offend. Most of ''Seize the Day'' is set in an Upper West Side hotel with a residential clientele that is almost exclusively Jewish. Mr. Bellow offers a world of the elderly whose only yardstick for success is money - who has held on to the most and whose children are earning even more. It is a suffocating, unpleasant universe of greed and selfishness. It is here where the failed Tommy must struggle to survive. But he is viciously cast aside by his own wealthy father, also living at the hotel, and swindled by the bamboozling Dr. Tamkin, supposedly an analyst, who talks him into investing in lard futures. While Tommy pleads for kindness and mercy, his disappointed father tells him ''it's torture for me to look at you.'' His unforgiving wife is out to see him suffer and even his children turn their backs. His only source of sympathy is gentle Olive (Glenne Headly), his Roman Catholic woman friend living in Massachusetts.
