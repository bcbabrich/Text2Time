The driver of the bus that crashed on a treacherous Sussex County road Sunday knew the brakes were faulty before he began the trip, officials said today as they charged him with six counts of aggravated manslaughter in the deaths of six passengers.

The driver, Robert Campbell, 60 years old, of Brooklyn, pulled his bus out of a garage in Jersey City two days before the trip, even though the garage owner warned him that the bus's brakes were so faulty that it should not be driven, said the Sussex County prosecutor, Dennis O'Leary.

In addition, Mr. O'Leary said, passengers on the trip from Williamsburg, Brooklyn to Action Park, an amusement park near Vernon, N.J., recalled that Mr. Campbell had tested and pumped the brakes before the outing began.

"He had pulled the bus forward, stopped, then backed up and stopped, repeating this procedure several times," Mr. O'Leary said. "He was mindful of the fact that there was a problem with the brakes. We have accounts of passengers who smelled the brakes burning and saw smoke well before the crash."
