Any anticorruption legislation introduced in the State Senate this session is expected to focus on city, rather than state, government.

That emphasis, however, would put the Republican-controlled Senate at odds with Governor Cuomo, who has responded to New York City's municipal scandal by introducing wide-ranging ethics legislation that would tighten financial disclosure requirements for state officials and, by barring them from practicing law before state agencies, limit their earning power.

The Democratic-controlled Assembly has quietly organized a task force, led by Oliver G. Koppell, a Bronx Democrat, to consider an ethics package. Speaker Stanley Fink and other key Assembly members have been unusually quiet about what form their legislation is likely to take, but the assumption among Capitol insiders is that it will, in moderated form, resemble the Governor's.

In the Senate, however, Warren M. Anderson, the majority leader, has repeatedly asserted that anticorruption measures ''should not be aimed at the Legislature when the Legislature is not the problem.''
