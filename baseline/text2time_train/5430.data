The Griffin Bacal agency, which is kept busy largely promoting the many toys of Hasbro, announced Friday that it is opening a London office with about $11 million in billings from Hasbro. It intends to seek out local accounts, however, and for that reason has staffed the shop with London talent. The exception is Gordon Hunt from the New York office, who will serve as general manager.
