Mormon Pride and Anxiety Over Romney’s Bid

“Perhaps all these strict constructionist Republicans would do well to actually follow the Constitution instead of displaying their religious bigotry at every opportunity. Oh well, just lump the Mormons in with the Muslims and gays and blacks and illegal immigrants and mainstream media among the groups to despise and rant against. And you wonder why your political party cannot attract anyone under 30. There are plenty of legitimate reasons to not vote for Romney, his religion isn’t one of them.”

Amid McCain Surge, Romney Camp Perseveres in New Jersey

“Why does the Republican Party feel like it should move toward the center when the Dems have not budged? Conservatives should stand up for their values and if the Republican Party wants to leave us and move to the left, then we need a new party. I am just sick of all of the Republicans jumping the conservative ship and compromising their principles to get a job in the McCain administration.”
