He has the same childlike playfulness, the same stretch-running style, even the same respiratory ailment. Alyrob so far has emulated his sire, Alysheba, right down to the blinkers that cover a small white star in the middle of his forehead. But only if Alyrob wins Saturday's 122d Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs will the comparison be complete.

In Alyrob's favor are his bloodlines. Alysheba was the winner of the 1987 Kentucky Derby, and his father, Alydar, was second to Affirmed in all three legs of a spellbinding Triple Crown series in 1978. Alyrob is also trained by Wally Dollase, who won more stakes races than any other trainer during the recently ended meeting at Santa Anita in California.

But Alyrob has been playing catch-up with this year's 3-year-old crop, and he may run out of time before Saturday. Alyrob has raced just five times; most recently, he finished second in the Santa Anita Derby, but was disqualified and placed last for interference. No Derby winner since Brokers Tip in 1933 has had as little experience. And Alyrob has raced just once in the last three months, because of throat surgery that kept him out of action from Feb. 4 until April 6.

"He might not have the experience, he's green, but he hasn't been used up, his legs are in good shape," Dollase said this morning, after Alyrob completed his serious Derby training with a five-furlong workout in 1:03. Dollase owns Alyrob along with 12 partners, including a former pro football kicker, 76-year-old Ben Agajanian.
