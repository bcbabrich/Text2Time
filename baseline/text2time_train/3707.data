Land trusts, once restricted to genteel corners of New England, are now growing the fastest in the Rockies and the Southwest, according to a new national survey of this land conservation movement.

In the last decade, as ranchers and urbanites grafted the land trust movement onto the rural West, the number of local land trusts jumped by 160 percent in the five-state Rockies division, 147 percent in the four-state Southwest division, and 108 percent in the six-state West division. While New England still has the largest number, 417, growth there was only 24 percent.

''People drive past shopping malls and subdivisions, they fight the traffic jams, and they are joining together as never before to protect land for the future,'' said Jean Hocker, president of the Land Trust Alliance, a nonprofit group that represents about two-thirds of the nation's 1,200 local land trusts.

The alliance conducted the national survey, which is to be released in Washington on Thursday. One of the nation's most popular conservation movements, local land trusts claim a collective, dues paying membership of one million people.
