Successful operations with two Convair airlines converted from piston‐powered to turbine‐propelled aircraft have prompted Frontier Airlines to convert its entire fleet of Convair 340 planes.

Lewis W. Dymond, president of the Denver‐based carrier, said that when the final conversion unit was delivered during the second quarter of 1966, he company would have a total of 15 CV580's, the new designation of the aircraft.

The aircraft will represent an investment of $16 million.

The CV580 is powered by two General Motors‐Allison 3,750‐horsepower turbine engines. It has a complete interior redesign. At 355 miles an hour the aircraft is 100 miles an hour faster than the pistonpowered 340. The converted plane also has three times the rate of climb and can carry eight more passengers for a total of 52.

During June, July and August, Frontier flew two 580's on its scheduled routes and logged more passenger mileage than all 20 of the line's DC‐3's during the same period. Operating costs during the three months fell substantially below those of the 340's.
