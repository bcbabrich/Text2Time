Thank you for your column on traveling with pets (March 4). But please expose the pet travel racket within Europe. We are seeking quotes for taking our Labrador from London to Nice in July or August. British Airways directs us to World Cargo (www.baworldcargo.com), which cites an oligopoly of four accredited shippers.

The “handling fee” for pickup and drop-off of the dog works out to £650 with V.A.T., or $1,262 at $1.98 to £1 — more than £16, or $31, per kilogram (including crate) — about twice the price of a round-trip business-class ticket. Last year, we paid only about £400 ($777) with British Midland, which took the dog as “excess baggage.” Are there other options?

It is costly to transport pets if you want them to be safe and comfortable, but there is no “racket” that I can see. As of October 2006, British Airways no longer allows passengers to check in their pets as excess baggage, but requires them to be shipped by a freight forwarding agent who has an account with British Airways and books the space, preferably a recognized pet travel agent, at cargo rates.

According to Ross Gays, European director of WorldCare Pet Transport (www.worldcarepet.com) in London: “Other airlines may start to require pets to travel only through cargo systems, via a pet travel agent, not checked in as before by the accompanying owner as excess baggage.”

But “cargo” costs a lot more than “excess baggage” because you are paying a freight forwarding agent, who then has to pay the airline for the transportation. Mr. Gays estimates that transporting your dog as “excess baggage” would have cost £150 compared with the £650 you were quoted. “But your reader is getting a reasonable deal,” Mr. Gays said. “We would have quoted more for the service that we provide.”

You are not required to use one of the four pet travel agents suggested by British Airways: Airpets.com; Par Air (www.parair.co.uk); Whitelea Skydogs (www.skydogs.co.uk); and Pinehawk Livestock Shippers (44-1223-290249). You can use any accredited agent, preferably a member of the Independent Pet and Animal Transportation Association (www.ipata.com). Who you choose may depend on price, level of service and where you going.

Air France allows pets to be checked in as excess baggage. But to fly nonstop from London to Nice, you are limited to British Airways and easyJet, which does not transport pets. (To fly Air France, you must change planes in Paris.) — ROGER COLLIS
