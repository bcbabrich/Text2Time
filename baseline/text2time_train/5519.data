Wall Street professionals were big sellers as stockholders of the Union Carbide Corporation tendered shares last night to the big chemical company for an $85 package of cash and securities.

Carbide shares, meanwhile, continued to climb in very busy trading yesterday, while shares of the GAF Corporation, which is trying to take over Carbide, continued to slump. Carbide rose 37.5 cents yesterday, to $70.875, with 4.7 million shares changing hands. The day before, Carbide slid $1.125, to $70.50, on a volume of 3.5 million shares. Carbide topped the most-active list on both days.

GAF, which plunged $5.75 on Monday, fell $3.50 yesterday, to $59. Opposing a Takeover

Carbide, which is fighting GAF's $74-a-share takeover bid, is offering a package of $20 in cash plus $65 in bonds. But the offer is for just 35 percent of its shares, and the company told shareholders to tender by midnight last night to qualify for proration. If Carbide gets more, it will buy only what it wants on a prorated basis.

Carbide is expected to announce the response to its offer early this month.

Wall Street professionals sold from their holdings of about a third of Carbide's 67.6 milllion shares. Some, however, said they were worried that not enough others had offered their stock.
