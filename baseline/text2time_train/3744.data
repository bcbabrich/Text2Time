ST. JOHN'S 97, ST. FRANCIS 63

It was the moment more than the context that rankled St. John's last night. The Red Storm built a 16-point lead over St. Francis of Brooklyn, only to watch the Terriers slash the gap with an 8-0 surge to begin the second half.

Shades of last week, when St. John's blew double-digit leads in losing to Stanford and Purdue, right?

But St. Francis is no Stanford or Purdue. The Red Storm responded with an 8-0 run and never was caught.

I was only concerned that there was an 8-0 run, St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis said. I wasn't concerned whether we would win the game or not. We tried not to have any letdown.
