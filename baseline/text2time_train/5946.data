Reports that prominent Argentines have been members of a secret Italian lodge called Propaganda 2 are being investigated here after the recent arrest in Switzerland of the Italian industrialist who headed it.

The industrialist, Licio Gelli, who was seized with a fraudulent Argentine passport in mid-September, was said to have disappeared from Italy 18 months ago and to have been in hiding here and in Uruguay under the protection of military leaders. Among the charges filed against him in Italy were swindling and espionage.

President Reynaldo B. Bignone has reportedly met with Argentina's senior military leaders to discuss the ramifications of statements made by Italian investigators that 26 prominent Argentines, among them generals, former Cabinet members and leading businessmen, had belonged to the secret lodge.

The Argentine Government recently announced regulations prohibiting television stations and state-owned radio stations from reporting on the affair and other sensitive matters. The regulations did not apply to newspapers or magazines. Journalists Are Threatened
