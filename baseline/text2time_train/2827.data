To the Editor:

David Brooks (''The Presidency Wars,'' column, Sept. 30) is dismayed by the ''haters'' of President Bush on the left, whose critiques, he claims, lack focus on policy and arise mainly from personal enmity. But it shouldn't be so difficult for anyone to put details to their dissent, these days.

It is not hate that drives my own dissatisfaction with the president, but his failed economic and budget policies, his destructive and backward environmental initiatives, his dubious and shifting logic for the Iraq invasion and his practice of crony capitalism in the reconstruction of the occupied country.
