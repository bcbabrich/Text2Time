The flat beside the cay was an ideal habitat for permit, which we could see feeding during the mornings we stayed there, their noses searching for crabs in the sand, their tails visible above water -- like thin black sails. The tailing permit has been the catalyst of more than one fly-fishing obsession. Certain maniac fly fishers will cast to thousands of elusive permit before hooking one.

The first afternoon, we went out to other cays and their adjacent flats, where I had my first shot at a school of tailing permit. Much as I would like to think of myself as an accomplished angler, the sight of these fish with their tails in the air befuddled me. On the first cast, I hooked my thigh and drew blood (it was the wind's fault, of course), then the guide told me to get into the shallow water and stalk the fish by wading, at which point I wrapped the line around my feet and fell overboard with a big splash.

The greatest pleasure of any fishing trip, especially when the fish get the better of you, is when you meet wonderful people. I learned a great deal about the area from my guide Eloy, a native of Monkey River village on the mouth of the Monkey River. He gave me a brief history of the Belize fishery.

''When I started fishing, man, all we had was handlines,'' Eloy said. ''We called it cotton line. As a kid we caught snook to 30 pounds all the time, and one day when the snappers were spawning my friend and I caught 140, averaging 10 pounds. I didn't know what a fishing rod was. The first fly-fishing rod I saw was in 1980. I saw this man in a boat up the Monkey River with his line up in the air. I thought, I want to do that thing with the line up in the air.

''We made flies with egret feathers. Man, those things were killer for snook. The Guatemalans introduced gill nets in southern Belize in 1970. They started using gill nets in Monkey River and Punta Negra. Ten years later, they had at least half the fish dead.''

Eloy grew up hunting in the forest for jaguar, peccary, jaguarundi and whatever else he could shoot. He hunted mostly at night and on several occasions was nearly bitten by fatal fer-de-lance snakes. He fished in the sea for snapper, lobster and conch. He and his friends kept everything they could get and killed it to eat or sell.

Now, Eloy is one of the greatest proponents of preserving the native fish and fauna and works closely with the Nature Conservancy to educate people to support the wildlife and become ecotourist guides.

''You got to protect the resource, man,'' he said. ''It's all we got.''

In the evening, we drank fresh coconut water with gin. Then, when it was dark and the wind was down, Eloy began his stories of the 70-minute nightmare of Hurricane Iris in October 2001. It is worth the trip merely to hear his story.
