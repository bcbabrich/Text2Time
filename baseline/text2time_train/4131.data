Edward Keaney, an analyst with Volpe, Welty in San Francisco, said the new contract would mean "more work and less sleep for that whole group of investment bankers and lawyers trying to cobble together the Wellpoint-Health Systems deal."

The Health Systems board approved the Wellpoint deal Thursday before the Pentagon announced it had selected Health Systems, but the deal is not closed. The boards of Wellpoint and its parent, Blue Cross of California, are still evaluating a competing offer by Blue Shield of California, which wants to buy Wellpoint. Blue Cross is not connected with Blue Shield in California.

"We are close," Dr. Hasan said, "but it's not over until it's over."

An H.M.O. owned by the Aetna Life and Casualty Company has had the contract since early last year. Aetna originally had a five-year $3.5 billion deal, but it was cut back after the General Accounting Office in Washington criticized the way the contract was awarded. The unhappy losers at that time included Dr. Hasan's company Qual Med, which later became part of Health Systems.

The Pentagon contract will increase the Californians covered by Health Systems by at least 50 percent and add at least $25 million to the company's net income, which was $88.5 million last year.

Dr. Hasan said, however, that Wellpoint's profits had exceeded $200 million annually so, in a merged Health Systems-Wellpoint, $25 million "looks like a very small potato."
