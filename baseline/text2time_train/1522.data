It was supposed to be a dream final between a brawny Spaniard with legendary wheels and a Swiss legend with a powerful forehand, especially after the Madrid Open final, the first match between Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer in exactly a year. Billed as the ultimate test for the greatest player ever, attempting to defeat the greatest clay courter ever, the dream tantalized until Robin Soderling’s blistering strokes crushed it like a piñata.

Soderling, seeded fifth this year, ended Federer’s French Open run in the quarterfinals, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5, 6-4.

A Nadal-Soderling final doesn’t quite have the ring, or the sensational stylistic contrast, that Nadal-Federer does, but if it comes to pass, there’s much to look forward to. Nadal would have a chance to win his fifth French Open title, avenge last year’s fourth-round loss to Soderling, and recapture the No. 1 ranking.

After losing today, Federer was asked if he had ever played as big a hitter as Soderling. His answer was yes, a guy named Juan Martin del Potro. A Nadal victory over Soderling would show that he cannot be overpowered on clay the way del Potro manhandled him on the United States Open hard courts last fall. Nadal will have all but proved his invincibility on clay when his knees are healthy.

For Soderling, this is his chance to be more than a giant killer — to become a giant himself. He could be remembered as the guy who beat two No. 1’s at the French Open. Or he could be remembered as the first Swede to win the Coupe des Mousquetaires since Mats Wilander in 1988.

But much can happen between now and Sunday. On Wednesday, Nadal plays his quarterfinal match against Nicolas Almagro, a strong clay courter with a one-handed backhand who was one of only two players able to push Nadal to three sets during his three straight Masters Series wins. If Nadal, who has yet to lose a set in Paris, gets the job done, he will face in the semifinals either No. 3 Novak Djokovic or a rejuvenated No. 22 Jurgen Melzer, who also face off on Wednesday.

And in the other semifinal, Soderling must overcome an in-form No. 15 Tomas Berdych, who defeated No. 17 John Isner, No. 4 Andy Murray and No. 11 Mikhail Youzhny in straight sets.

In keeping with his reputation for bluntness, Soderling answered a post-match question about how he handled the crowd booing his line challenges: “I play for myself and I play for the win, not for the crowd.”

For his part, Federer’s reaction was a far cry (pun intended) from his reaction after losing to Nadal at last year’s Australian Open. Perhaps he’s more relaxed — even complacent? — now that he owns the most major titles, including that elusive French Open trophy. Is it the beginning of the end of the Federer era? Will Djokovic, Murray, Soderling and del Potro (when he returns from injury) push him aside? Or will Wimbledon once again bring out his best? After today’s loss, he appeared untroubled. When asked about the end of his remarkable string of 23 consecutive Grand Slam semifinals, Federer joked, “Now I’ve got the quarterfinal streak going, I guess.”
