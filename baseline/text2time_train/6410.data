BADEN, Austria, July 2 —International efforts to link the growing consumer movement with the fight against pollution met a harsh response today from African and Asian na tions.

“We are not concerned with pollution but with existence.” Dr. Shankran Kristnamurthy, director of the Consumers Council in India, said as the International Organization of Consumers Unions broke into a. series of debates in this gar den city 16 miles south of Vienna. “The wealthy countries worry about car fumes. We worry about starvation.”

His remarks were echoed even outside the conference hall by delegates of other poor countries who seemed to reflect a growing worldwide concern.

In workshops and meetings of the 30‐nation organiza tion, which was formed 10 years ago to protect con sumers from high prices and shoddy merchandise, delegates from India, Ghana, Malaysia and other countries bluntly questioned the driving efforts of European and American of ficials here to link the consum er and pollution efforts.
