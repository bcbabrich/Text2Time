6. Resolved: To be as cordial on our arrival at a restaurant as we expect the hostess or maitre d' to be in greeting us. Nothing can put a damper on an evening out faster than a dour greeting or non-greeting. At all too many places, the official attitude is, "Don't bother me. Can't you see I'm busy?" or "What do you want?" The official greeter should never be that busy. Nothing sets the tone for the meal better than a welcoming smile on arrival.

7. Resolved: If a dish is not as requested -- overcooked when ordered rare, raw when ordered medium -- we have the right and the responsibility to send it back. Many diners are reluctant to do this for fear of making a scene, but it can be done quietly, in a friendly, non-imperious manner. After all, as diners paying the bill we have the right to expect a dish to be as ordered.

8. Resolved: If a dish is described as consisting of goat cheese, chorizo sausage and black beans and arrives without the sausage, we should ask the server where the missing sausage is. As diners, we have the right to expect truth in menus.

If a key ingredient isn't available on a given day -- the sausage, pistachios, sun-dried tomatoes or whatever may be the impetus for ordering a particular dish -- the kitchen should inform staff members who should in turn relay this to the guest.

9. Resolved: If the food is disappointing because of kitchen inadequacies, we won't take out our displeasure on the server.

10. Resolved: To respond candidly when the server asks, "How was everything?" All too often most of us make the pro forma response, "Just fine," when in fact the soup was underseasoned, the entree was too salty, the dessert was completely different from its menu description. When asked, we resolve to try to give an honest answer in a tactful way.

All too often we simply do not return to a place that has disappointed us. By responding directly we provide helpful feedback to a caring chef or management. We can also judge a restaurant by how it responds to such candor: defensively, indifferently or with real interest. A restaurateur serious about his or her work usually appreciates thoughtful, constructive comments.
