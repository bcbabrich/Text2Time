To the Editor:

When I read that a fraternity pledge at Louisiana State University had overdosed on alcohol after drinking at a bar, I knew the bar had to be Murphy's (news article, Aug. 27). That's Greek central at L.S.U. When I was a student there, the alternative crowd hung out on Chimes Street, near Murphy's, and it was common for fraternity men who got soused at Murphy's to speed down Chimes in their B.M.W.'s, hurling beer bottles and insults at punks, hippies, gay students and others who didn't look like them.

Alcohol just exacerbates the rat-pack arrogance of fraternity men and brings it aggressively to the surface. I am sorry that a student died at my alma mater, but I will not be sorry if it leads to the demise of the L.S.U. fraternity system.
