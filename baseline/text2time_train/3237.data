For years, the pattern had struck many people in the boxing business as fishy. One after another, Colombian fighters with almost no experience outside Colombia would appear out of nowhere, rise rapidly up the International Boxing Federation's rankings and get a shot at a title. Most of them then lost the title fight and disappeared.

Carlos Mercado, a junior bantamweight of little renown, rose to the No. 1 contender's spot, then was soundly beaten by the champion, Robert Quiroga, in 1992. Felix Naranjo, a miniflyweight, also ascended rapidly to contender's status and got a 1993 title fight against the champion, Ratanapol Vorapin of Thailand, who knocked him out in two rounds.

Miguel Julio became the top lightweight contender in 1995 with dubious credentials and persuaded the I.B.F. to order the champion at the time, Oscar De La Hoya, to fight him. But De La Hoya gave up the I.B.F. belt instead, saying the match would be an embarrassment. Julio was later whipped by Philip Holliday, a lower-ranked South African.

The boxing insiders' suspicions now have firm support. The Colombian fighters' manager, Ivan Feris Chadid, said in a sworn affidavit that he had paid dozens of bribes from 1989 to 1997 to I.B.F. officials to advance his fighters in the rankings.
