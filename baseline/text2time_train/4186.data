Dr. Chernofsky told his family that his brain had been deprived of oxygen for 8 to 13 minutes, according to family members who provided details of the case. Brain cells start to die after five minutes without oxygen. A CAT scan a week or so after the accident showed a severe brain injury that left Lloyd Reback where he lies today, in an irreversible coma at Hilltop Manor, a rehabilitation hospital for brain-injured patients near Schenectady, N.Y. The Runner Minor Surgery Had Fatal Results

Denise Verbeeck's knee surgery was the kind of minor outpatient operation that occurs at thousands of hospitals across the country every day. Her orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Neil Watnik, had told Ms. Verbeeck that the operation on her kneecap should take less than two hours, her sister Debbie said, and that she should expect to stay with her parents through a few weeks of recovery. Though mildly retarded, Ms. Verbeeck worked and lived independently in a group home in Commack, L.I. She had won several medals in past Special Olympics and hoped to resume running this summer.

The surgery on Ms. Verbeeck's knee was a success, but like Mr. Reback, she got into trouble in the recovery room. Ms. Verbeeck's medical records were made available by her family.

The anesthesiologist, Dr. Nalini Prasad, noted in the patient's chart that the anatomy of Ms. Verbeeck's mouth and chin might make the insertion of the tube difficult. As a result, the doctor had to place it through Ms. Verbeeck's nose instead of her mouth, guiding it into the lungs with the aid of a tiny fiber-optic scope.

The anesthesiologist removed the tube shortly after the surgery, noting that the patient was awake, and transferred her to the recovery room. She told Ms. Verbeeck's family that Ms. Verbeeck had said she was happy to have the tube out and complained that her knee hurt.

But soon afterward, the monitors tracking the oxygen in her blood showed abnormally low levels. And by the afternoon, when her oxygen levels dropped further and she began to cough up bright red blood, doctors from the intensive-care unit were called. The exact problem that led to Ms. Verbeeck's death or who, if anyone, is responsible, is still unclear, and her autopsy has not yet been completed. Dr. Prasad, through the hospital, declined to comment. But a chest X-ray that afternoon showed that she had pneumonia in both lungs, and notes in the chart by several doctors diagnose the problem as blood or stomach contents entering her lungs before or after surgery.

The passage of solids or liquids into the lungs, known as aspiration, is a potential complication of any general anesthesia, which blocks the body's gag reflex. But it is the anesthesiologist's mission to prevent it. Aspiration can occur when a patient is overly sedated before receiving a breathing tube, or when the tube is removed prematurely, before the gag reflex has returned. Aspiration occurs in 1 in 12,000 patients receiving elective surgery, and 1 in 70,000 dies.
