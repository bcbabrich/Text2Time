Edward P. Seigenfeld, vice president-marketing of the New York Racing Association, has hired Diener Hauser Bates to do the media buying for his advertising campaigns. Diener Hauser, a subsidiary of Ted Bates Worldwide, specializes in advertising for the entertainment world.

The previous agency, for some 16 years, was McCann-Erickson and for most of those years it did all of the work, both creating and placing advertisements. The split was in early July.

Mr. Seigenfeld, a former marketing executive for a movie company, said that Diener will be paid a reduced media commission and that the creative work for broadcast will be done by Cinema Mistral while the print work is handled by Martin, Sturtevant, Silverman & Marshall. While the meeting is at Saratoga, he noted, advertising will be handled by Silverman Mow Inc., Syracuse.
