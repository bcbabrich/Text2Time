For the second time in less than a month the Folger Coffee Company has announced that it is reducing the wholesale price of its ground coffee. Yesterday, Folger, the nation's second largest roaster after the General Foods Corporation, trimmed 20 cents from the wholesale price to $3.98 a pound.

Folger, which is a division of the Procter & Gamble Company, became the first major roaster to roll back the price since a July 1975 frost destroyed three‐quarters of Brazil's crop with its first cut of 25 cents a pound on May 12. Before the cut the price was at an all‐time record level of $4.46 a pound.

The drop in Folger's list price reflected “declines in imported green coffee prices during the past several weeks,” a Folger spokesman said. In White Plains, a spokesman for the General Foods Corporation denied reports that the company planned to cut coffee prices.
