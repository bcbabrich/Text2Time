To the Editor:

There has been confusion about the meaning of the Supreme Court's decision in Church of the Lukumi Balalu Aye. Contrary to what some may think, the Court did not hold animal sacrifices to be protected. Rather, the Court held that these practices could not be prohibited by legislation that was specifically intended to target religious practices alone.

A municipality may still ban animal sacrifices as long as the subject of regulation is the method of sacrifice, "not a religious classification that is said to bear some relationship to it." That is, regulation under a neutral anticruelty statute is still permissible. Moreover, a municipality may still ban all slaughter outside of licensed packinghouses or prohibit completely the keeping of certain types of animals in dwellings.

There is legitimate concern about the cruelty of Santeria sacrifices. Santeria practitioners often allow the animals to bleed for extended periods of time so that the blood may be used throughout the ceremony. Smaller animals, such as birds, have their heads ripped off.

Animals used in Santeria ceremonies are often kept in filthy and inhumane conditions, and deprived of food or water, for days before the ceremony. Decomposing animal bodies are disposed of in public places as part of the religious mandate.
