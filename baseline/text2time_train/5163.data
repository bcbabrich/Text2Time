According to Cindy E. Soehner, her son, Shane, is ''the kind of child who keeps teachers on their toes.'' From her description, he is also the kind of child who can't stop talking long enough to listen and learn, who demands his way, who doesn't recognize authority, and, when he doesn't get his way, he is ''an underachiever, a discipline problem, and an unhappy little boy.''

Ms. Soehner need not ''beat him into submission.'' Maybe he is too immature to operate in a group situation. Maybe he should not be sent to school just yet. But unless she accepts the fact that Shane will be living in society, it behooves her to let him know that for several hours a day this 6-year-old is expected to operate with others, considering the needs of his classmates as well as his own.

He is not too young to learn (but may be too old to learn at some future date) that everything in the world will not be to his liking, and that sometimes it is necessary to defer gratification in order to make tomorrow better than today.

If the ''school system is at fault,'' so is the world Shane will have to live in. Let's hope that he will develop sufficiently to understand this before it is too late. When he does, he will be ready to ''question authority and to fight for what he believes.'' Right now he is too ignorant and inexperienced to know what to believe. RENA G. KUNIS Bellerose
