Jan 2, 1917, was a sparkling cold winter day in Raron, a small Swiss town surrounded by snow-covered Alps in the Valais. On a rocky ledge high above the town in a churchyard a cluster of people gathered somberly around an open grave listening to one of the mourners recite: ''Of course, it is strange to inhabit the earth no longer,/to give up customs one barely had time to learn,/not to see roses and other promising things/in terms of a human future. . . .''

The grave was that of the poet Rainer Maria Rilke, and the recitation came from the first of the Duino Elegies, which he had completed five years earlier while living in a small stone tower grandly named Chateau de Muzot. It was there after a lifetime of wandering that he had found the peace that at last allowed him to finish the Elegies - started years before in the castle, near Trieste, of his friend and patron the Princess Marie von Thurn and Taxis-Hohenlohe - as well as to compose the ''Sonnets to Orpheus.''

When he realized he was gravely ill with leukemia, Rilke left instructions that he be buried in the nearby graveyard of the 13th-century Burgkirche in Raron under a headstone inscribed only with his name, the family coat of arms and a single couplet of his poetry. His last months were difficult. To his old lover and friend Lou Andreas-Salome, he wrote of the torturous pain that was racking his body, ''Lou, I cannot tell you what hells I am enduring. You know how I have accommodated pain, the physical as well as the truly severe pain from my philosophy of life But now it is burying me completely. It is taking over from me day and night! Where will I find the courage?''

After reminding a friend to make sure that he would not have what he called a ''doctor's death'' but would instead have his ''freedom,'' Rilke died on Dec. 29, 1926, at 51. This last June, 61 years later, my teen-age son and I, our rental car packed with dog-eared translations of Rilke's works, made a pilgrimage to the poet's grave in Raron. Driving westward on E-2 through the broad Rhone River Valley past an endless and most un-Rilkelike procession of cars and trucks that roared between Sierre and Brig and the Simplon Pass, and by gas stations, supermarkets, discos and the Helicopter Flugfeld Raron, which provides airborne livery for the jet set to the nearby Matterhorn resort, I felt far from the spirit of this great writer. But when I looked up from the road and saw the needle-sharp spire of the Burgkirche soaring heavenward, the reason why Rilke had chosen this valley as his resting place became more self-evident.
