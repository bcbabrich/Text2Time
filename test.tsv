Priscilla ChanThe New York Times Learning Network

Bridget AndersonThe Bank Street College of Education in New York City

Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. List what they know and wish to know about Albert Einstein in a K-W-L chart.

2. Learn about Einstein’s iconic status and future scientists on his level by reading and discussing the article “The Next Einstein? Applicants Welcome.”

3. Createin pairstrading cards about Einstein and another notable scientist.

4. Develop a job description that seeks out “the next Einstein.”

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-paper

-classroom board

-index cards (two per pair)

-trading cards (baseball cards and/or other collectible cards; optional)

-copies of the article “The Next Einstein? Applicants Welcome,” found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050301tuesday.html (one per student)

-resources about Albert Einstein and other famous scientists (computers with Internet accessalmanacslibrary resourcesencyclopediasetc.)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Before classcreate a KWL chart on the board to complete as a class. (Create three columns: the left – K – column should be titled “What Do We Know?”; the middle – W – column should be titled “What Do We Want to Know”?”; the right – L – column should be titled “What Did We Learn?” The K and W columns will be completed at this point in the lesson; the L column may be filled out after the completion of the research in Activity 3 below.) Upon entering classstudents respond to the following prompt in their journals (also written on the board prior to class): “Copy the following table into your journaland write at least two statements in the K and W columns about Albert Einstein.” After a few minutesallow students to share their responses and copy them onto the chart on the board.

Discussas a classwhat students know or believe about Albert Einsteinincluding his achievementsbackgroundfamelegacyetc. Students may write their opinions in the W column as statements they would like to determine as true or false about the scientist.

2. As a classread and discuss the article “The Next Einstein? Applicants Welcome” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050301tuesday.html)focusing on the following questions:

a. Why was Albert Einsteinin his adolescencenot likelyin many eyesto amount to scientific greatness?

b. What are some examples of Einstein’s stunning success in science and society?

c. Why does Einstein’s development as a scientist both “comfort” and “haunt” peopleaccording to the article?

d. How does Dr. Michael Turner describe Einstein’s appealand why is this description an important quality for scientists?

e. Why might it be “distractingdaunting and ultimately demoralizing” for a younger scientist to be called “the new Einstein”?

f. To what does Dr. Stephen Hawking attribute the constant comparisons of new scientists to Einstein?

g. What does it mean to articulate “the role of the individual in modern science,” according to the article?

h. What combination of qualities did Einstein possess that helped him achieve his iconic status?

i. Why is the field of physics “vast and sprawling”?

j. What does Dr. Edward Witten consider to be Einstein’s notable reason for success?

k. How does Dr. Michael Turner measure a scientist’s impactand using this measurementhow does Einstein compare with other scientists?

l. What are the different conceptions and images of “Einstein,” according to the article?

m. What was the social/political background during Einstein’s heyday?

n. According to the articlewhat were some other descriptors for Einsteinbesides “the Elvis of science”?

o. Whataccording to the articleare some distinctive attributes of Einstein as described by other physicists?

p. What is generally considered Einstein’s greatest achievement?

q. Why is general relativity described as “the result of pure thought”?

r. How did Einstein’s personal and political life alter his love of scienceif at all?

s. What is meant by Einstein’s “perceived irreverence”?

t. How does science represent a field by which someone without a “privileged background” can succeed?

u. How did Einstein typically start off his papers?

v. Why have philosophy and physics become distantaccording to the article?

w. In what ways has modern science entered into the popular consciousness?

x. How does Einstein compare with Watson and Crickor Dr. Stephen J. Hawking?

y. Where is the place for new ideas in physics?

z. What are the two conceptions of realityin terms of general relativity and quantum mechanics?

aa. What attempts to bridge these two differing conceptions?

bb. According to the articlewhat are possible “Einsteinian opportunities”?

At this pointstudents may draw facts from the New York Times article for the L column from the Warm-Up activity about what they have just learned about Einstein.

3. Explain that studentsin pairswill be researchingusing available sourcesenough information to create two scientist trading cards (using index cards): one on Albert Einstein and one on another scientist of note. (If availableteachers may distribute baseball or other collectible cards as examples of trading cards before proceeding with the activity.) Possible suggestions are some of the scientists mentioned in the New York Times article like Dr. Stephen Hawking or famous scientists of the past such as Marie CurieRachel CarsonCharles Darwinetc. Encourage students to engage their own creativity and originality in creating the trading cards. At minimumcards must have:

-a picture of the scientist

-basic biographical information such as date and place of birth (andif applicabledeath)

-a list of achievementsdiscoveriesawardsetc.

-memorable quotes

-other interesting facts or trivia about the scientist

Once students have completed their trading cardsthey should join together into groups of two pairs (four students). Students should first compare and contrast their Albert Einstein trading cards. As pairs sharestudents should also add to the L column from the Warm-Up activity the new facts they learn about Albert Einstein. Then students should show their second card and describe the scientist they have selected to profile. Students may discuss which of the profiled scientists might haveor have hadthe potential to reach iconic status like Einstein and why.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individuallystudents complete the following task (written on the board for students to copy down before leaving class): “Recall the headline of the New York Times article: “The Next Einstein? Applicants Welcome.” Look at want ads and other resources on the Internet or in a newspaper and come up with a list of information generally found in a job posting for a scientistsuch as organizational descriptionacademic or work experiencecompensationetc. Then write a job description for a scientist that you feel would engage applicants with the potential to be the ‘next Einstein.'” In a future classhave students share their job descriptions.

Further Questions for Discussion:

-What is the most influential scientific discovery of your generation? Of your parents’ generation?

-What are some examples of philosophical quandaries?

-Do you think Einstein is “overrated”? Why or why not?

-Do you have to understand science to fully appreciate Einstein’s achievements? Why or why not?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on initial journal responsesthoughtful participation in class discussionscooperation in small groupscreation of trading cards about famous scientistsand job descriptions seeking the “next Einstein.”

Extension Activities:

1. Choose one of Einstein’s scientific accomplishments and create a children’s book describing the discovery in both easy-to-understand text and visuals.

2. Make a list of the heroes or icons in current popular culture. Think about both fictional and real-life heroes. Compare and contrast the characteristics of a fictional and a real-life hero. What makes each one a hero in the public’s eyes? Is it something he or she did in the pastor something done over time? What sets him or her apart from other characters or people? Do heroes tend to have certain interests or occupations?

3. Search the Internet for images of Einstein. Why was he so photogenic? What personality attributes are captured by these images? Imagine you are the curator of a photo gallery exhibit on Einstein. What text descriptions would you give of each photo?

4. Einstein’s discoveries are often difficult for young students to understand initially. Explore the Web Site devoted to Einstein at the American Museum of Natural History online (//www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/). Describe at least five strategies used by the Web site to make the science more accessible to a younger audience.

5. Einstein was considered a genius. What does that word mean? Browse the following Web sites: //www.cse.emory.edu/sciencenet/mismeasure/genius/research04.html and //hem.bredband.net/b153434/Index.htm#Introduction about the “intelligence quotient,” or IQ. Research the controversy surrounding IQ tests. Firstlearn about IQ testswhat they testhow they test it and what different score levels are supposed to represent. Then look for critiques of IQ tests. Describe the main criticisms and alternative intelligence assessments that have been created. Write an opinion essay about whether you think IQ tests are a legitimate test of a person’s intelligenceand why. Does Einstein’s high IQ make you view him in an even more iconic manner?

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Global Studies – Create a timeline reviewing Einstein’s role in the movement against global nuclear proliferation. Why was he called “humanity’s atomic conscience”?

Media Studies – The New York Times article notes that Dr. Stephen Hawking says that constant comparisons of him to Einstein have less to do with his own accomplishments and more to do with “the media’s need for heroes.” What does he mean by this sentimentand do you agree? Write an essay in which you cite examples ofor lack ofthis “need.”

Teaching with The Times – Keep a scrapbook of newspaper articles that paint someone as “heroic” or worthy of iconic status. Are there patterns to the types of “hero” stories that are reported in The New York Times? Write an analysis in which you cite your clippings and describe differing definitions of hero or icon.

After the floodwaters created by Hurricane Sandy began receding from the Midland Beach neighborhood of Staten Islandone of the first things that Aiman Youseff did was to set up a table on the sidewalk near what was left of his house at 489 Midland Avenue.

Over the next month that patch of pavement was used by hundreds of people who either lived on the island or traveled there to help those in need. The volunteers began referring to the spot outside Mr. Youseff’s house as a hub and it became part of a network of similar places — churchescommunity centers and street corners — that were used as assembly points and distribution centers.

The volunteers gave out hot food and warm clothes andeventuallyformed groups to tear soddenmoldy drywall from flooded homes and help residents to rebuild. Several organizations including Occupy Sandyan offshoot of Occupy Wall Streetand another volunteer group called the Yellow Team also used the location. Mounds of donated supplies quickly took up the entire sidewalk for half a block in front of LaRocca’s Family Restaurant.

Now some are worried that the city may try to halt their organizing efforts. On Thursday and Fridaythose people saida city official told them that they would have to dismantle their operation.

According to Farid Kader29a Staten Island resident and a volunteerthe official identified himself as Ronald Cohen and said he worked for the mayor’s office.

“He told us‘we’re moving you out,’ ” Mr. Kader said. “He told us it was unsafe. That’s the word he used.”

After thatMr. Kader saidthe official ordered a Red Cross truck that was delivering supplies to the area to leave.

Reached at a cellphone number that he left with Mr. YouseffMr. Cohen told a reporter he would call backbut did not. Officials did not respond to several telephone calls to City Hall on Saturday and Sunday. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s press secretaryMarc LaVorgnadid not reply to e-mails asking to confirm the official worked for the mayor’s office and whether his message to the volunteers expressed the city’s position.

Mr. Kader and others said that they had no desire to fight with the city. Stillthey addedthe volunteers had worked hard for weeks to help people in the immediate aftermath of the storm when official city aid was barely visible.

“If it wasn’t for the volunteersnothing would be getting done out here,” he said. “If they wanted to start a site on Midland Avenue themselves we would clap hands and walk away.”

Several of the New York neighborhoods that suffered the worst storm damage are on Staten Island. Volunteer groups were the first to arrive in many areas where residents needed help and members of several groups said that the city should allow them to continueeven if official agencies assume more control over operations.

“We have been providing everything from hot food and tampons to bleach and crowbars,” said a volunteerHannah Scott. “The sense of having that taken away is creating panic.”

After the official’s visitsome volunteers saidpolice commanders arrived on Midland Avenue and said that the hub could use partbut not all of the sidewalk.

On Saturday the volunteers moved the hub’s kitchen onto a driveway off the street. Using money donated from friendsthey built a raised plywood platform for the kitchen and erected two white tarps overhead.

Along Midland Avenue a single line of folding tables remainedstacked with donated goods including cans of green beansdiapersRed Cross blanketsjars of baby food and tubes of toothpaste.
 4103,  1995, a, Just as there was more to sports in 1994 than the Rangers winning and the World Series vanishingthere was more to sports books than the bound version of Ken Burns's "Baseball." Various members of the Times sports department offer what they consider were some of the best sports books published in 1994. OCTOBER 1964 David Halberstam (Villard Books$24).

An intriguing sociology of an era told through a season. Halberstam uses the classic 1964 Yankees-Cardinals World Series to trace the demise of the Yankees empirelargely due to the franchise's failure to grasp the implications of Jackie Robinson and the integration of major league baseball. The Cardinals became something of a model of integration during the mid-60's. WILLIAM C. RHODEN

In ''Why Won't Mandela Renounce Violence?'' (Op-EdJune 21)David G. Sanders attempts to criticize Nelson Mandela's position to liberate black South Africans. He fails to recognize that his forefathers were responsible for an extremely violent overthrow of their British oppressors in 1776.

Furthermorethe United States wholeheartedly praised Romania's violent removal of Nicolae Ceausescu. The United States was also involved in militarily deposing Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriegaan action in which human life was lost. There was only praise for those actions.

I am sure Mr. Sanders has not been violently beatenlike many black South Africansjust for making a statement. His civil rights are not abused dailyand he has not spent the last 27 years in prison. It seems Mr. Sanders's knowledge in this area lacks insight.

 4694,  1992, a, Bobby Fischer tried the same type of quiet positional play yesterday in Game 27 that he had used to defeat Boris Spassky in Game 9but this time it got him nothing. The players agreed to a draw after 46 moves of uneventfulthough stubbornmaneuvering.

Fischer has nine victories in their Belgrade matchand will be awarded the winner's $3.35 million prize if he can add one more to his score. Spassky has won fiveand seems headed for the loser's share$1.65 million. Neverthelesshe seems determined not to be a pushover.

Fischer made a slight alteration from his known strategy in this gameand may have expected to harvest more from it. Spassky's defensehoweverwas impeccable. In factit worked so well that he could reasonably entertain some small hopes of fabricating a victory out of it. But Fischer played carefullyholding his opponent at bayand neither player could significantly disturb the game's balance. A Healing Rest?

It is possible that Fischer was not averse to taking such a draw after having been squashed in the previous game. Licking one's wounds is considered an important part of chess generalship. Spassky would have done moreif he could have.
 2742,  2003, a, ''Current management had an opportunity to restate this transaction along with the $190 million,'' Mr. Rohan said''so it would beg the question of why they thought this was so different.''

Supporters of Mr. Parsons note that he never promised a quick or easy end to the accounting investigations. In meetings with employees and in public statementsMr. Parsons has discussed the course of the investigation as a significant uncertainty hanging over the company's futurepeople who worked with him said.

The company has said that its auditorsErnst & Youngapproved the accounting for the Bertelsmann dealand some lawyers noted that AOL Time Warner may dissuade the S.E.C. from requiring another restatement.

''The fact that the S.E.C. has engaged in dialogue with the company with respect to this issue does not indicate a decision one way or another,'' said Lewis D. Lowenfelsan expert in securities law at Tolins & Lowenfels in New York.

One reason AOL Time Warner's management did not suspect the dealhoweveris that S.E.C. policy is still evolving in addressing abuses of the Internet booma time when many online companies artificially inflated their results by exchanging goods and services at overstated values. So farthe S.E.C. has mainly cracked down on circular arrangements that two companies used to swap payments through a third partyhiding the reciprocity to deceive investors. AOL Time Warner's previous restatements corrected several undisclosed three-way transactions initiated by the AOL division and only occasionally involving otherspeople involved in the internal inquiry have said.

But AOL Time Warner and Bertelsmann appeared to disclose both sides of their transaction to investorsand the S.E.C. is still raising enough doubts about its propriety to warrant disclosure in the company's filings. The S.E.C. is evidently questioning whether the advertising sold to Bertelsmann was really a true sale worth $400 million.

The wide approach raises issues about the market value of online advertising and leads to similar inquiries into smaller reciprocal deals AOL made. For yearsRobert W. Pittmanformer president of America Online and chief operating officer of AOL Time Warnersaid with pride that AOL seldom opened its checkbook for a telecommunications company or other business partner without selling it some online advertising as well. Many dealsincluding the Bertelsmann transactioninvolved at least some sales of advertising in other parts of the companylike its Turner Broadcasting networks or Time Inc. magazines.

 5665,  1985, a, The Interior Department today canceled the second part of a scheduled sale of oil leases off New Englandciting lack of industry interest and a court decision that placed much of the area under Canadian jurisdiction.

The first part of the salewhich included the Georges Bank fishing groundwas canceled in September after no bids were received for the available tracts except for those submitted by Greenpeacea conservation group that opposed the sale.

The department also announced that it would defer setting a date for still another sale of offshore oil leases in the area until a new five-year plan for the development of the outer continental shelf was completed.

That plan would succeed the current five-year program put into effect by James G. Watt when he was the Secretary of the Interior. That programwhich made virtually the entire billion- acre AtlanticPacific and Alaskan coasts available to bidding by oil companieswas attacked by conservationists and officials of coastal states who said it did not pay sufficient heed to the coastal environment and coastal economies.

A truck plummeted over a railing and crashed on the New Jersey side of the Lincoln Tunnel on Wednesday afternooninjuring a dozen people and disrupting the preholiday travel plans for thousands of riders.

The crash was startlingwith the vehiclean orange garbage trucklanding nose-first on the westbound lanes of Route 495which carries traffic flowing out of Manhattan.

The accident came at the worst possible time of the holiday weeksnarling traffic across many Manhattan streets as drivers struggled to reach other tunnels and bridges and leaving hordes of commuters fuming in long lines to board packed trains or wait out the accident cleanup.
 182,  2018, a, KUALA LUMPURMalaysia — In highway billboards and radio announcementsthe government of Malaysia is warning of a new enemy: “fake news.”

On Mondaythe lower house of Parliament passed a bill outlawing fake newsthe first measure of its kind in the world. The proposalwhich allows for up to six years in prison for publishing or circulating misleading informationis expected to pass the Senate this week and to come into effect soon after.

The legislation would punish not only those who are behind fake news but also anyone who maliciously spreads such material. Online service providers would be responsible for third-party contentand anyone could lodge a complaint. As long as Malaysia or Malaysians are affectedfake news generated outside the country is also subject to prosecution.

What qualifies as fake newshoweveris ill defined. Ultimatelythe government would be given broad latitude to decide what constitutes fact in Malaysia.
 4724,  1991, a, Even as the report reached Mr. Dinkinsthe Transit Authority was notified of the first of what is expected to be many lawsuits by injured passengers -- in this case a $15 million damage claim by a 23-year-old riderPamela Owens of Brooklynwho said she had gone four hours without emergency treatment and had suffered permanent lung damage from smoke inhalation. Recommendations Made

In its recommendationsthe reportwhich had been requested by the Mayor and was signed by First Deputy Mayor Norman Steiselsuggested that the Transit Authority directly and immediately notify the Police and Fire Departments and the Emergency Medical Services in future emergencies.

It also urged that the authority participate more fully in city planning for emergencies; suggested that E.M.S. crews receive training and breathing apparatus to enable them to go into smoky tunnels to treat patients soonerand urged that the authority and the E.M.S. jointly arrange for buses to carry large amounts of oxygen to major emergencies.

"It's better to be safe than sorry," Mr. Dinkins said late yesterday as he released the report at a City Hall news conference. Transit Agency Takes Exception

Alan F. Kiepperpresident of the Transit Authorityalso appeared at the news conference and disputed the report's conclusion that miscues of communication by his agency were responsible for delaying and misdirecting the rescue efforts. He insisted there was no breakdown in communications.

"After having reviewed the transcripts of the communication that took place," he said"what was communicated was the best information to our people that was available at the time. In my judgmentthey gave the best information they had. I believe our personnel performed well."

Mr. Kiepper conceded that some communications could have been speededbut he said: "It's easy to make judgments three days later about what could have been done. Keep in mindour first concern was getting the passengers away from the source of the flames and smoke."

 1711,  2009, a, In what we assume will be our final look at late-night comedy’s coverage of celebrity deathwe come at last to “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,” which addressed the subject on Tuesday night. (What was that you were saying about “aged news,” Jason Jones?)

In this merciless clipJon Stewart emcees a portion of the RIPpy Awardscommemorating “those media alchemists who spin celebrity death into television gold.” It concludes with the moment that the “Daily Show” declares to be “the single stupidest comment about Michael Jackson‘s death.”

 6249,  1973, a, Only the aloof Nurmi was unimpressed. He was a shy man who disliked the limelightcould not comprehend Americans' interest in records and was happiest with the countrymen he met in various cities.

Many of his records on this tour were at odd distances1¾ miles1⅞ miles2¼ miles —but there was one with which none quibbled—his 8:58.2 for two miles in a New York Athletic Club meeting at the old Madison Square Garden. It was the first time that distance had been run in under 9 minutesand the mark stood until 1941.

He also ran the indoor mile at 4:12a slow speed by to day's standardsbut then it was dizzyinglike his outdoor mile of 4:10.4 on a cinder track.

Nurmi's other feats included a series of races on successive nightsduring which he established three world records in New Yorkanother in Chicago and then a final one in New York. He was beatentwicemost memorably in a 5,000‐meter race; but even as a loser he dominated the news.

In 1925 and afterwardNurmi's financial dealings got him into trouble. He was accused of taking money under the table by submitting inflated expense accounts; and for this he was barred from 1932 Olympics at Los Angeles. He blamed his predicament on sports writerswhohe saidhad disclosed his violations of the amateur code to the International Amateur Athletic Federation. The complaint was that many athletes received extra moneybut that he alone had been caught.

Whatever the merits of the disputeNurmi was a hero in Finlandwhere a bronze statue of him running in the nude was put up outside the Helsinki Olympic Stadiuman uncommon tribute to even the greatest athletes. As late as last summertour groups were taken to the statue and told of the runner's accomplishment.

His beginnings were much humbler. The son of a carpenterPaavo Johannes Nurmi was born in Turku on June 131897. When he was 12his father died. At 15 he went to support died. At 15 he went to work in a foundry to support his motherbrother and two sister. When he was 17 he began to develop his stamina and technique with solitary practice of 50 miles a week. This trainingcarried on through his active yearsenabled him to reel off lap after lap inexorably and with graceful strides. He had learned the importance of steadiness in training by carrying a stop‐watch so that he could time each lap. Sometimesin a racehe also carried the watch to time his laps.

 3570,  1999, a, The district superintendentSonia Diaz Salcedohopes that the drive will call attention to district schools that work and keep enough families with high-scoring children to help lift District 1 out of the mediocre middle of achievement among the city's 32 school districts.

It is a strategy that wealthy suburbs seldom have to think about. And it is one that leads to arguments about equity. Is it possibleparents and school officials askto create good schools by attracting strong students without further damaging the struggling schools they leave behind?

The district beganMs. Salcedo saidby strengthening its elementary schoolsusing two modelsthe Neighborhood Schoolfounded by teachersand Public School 34a classic neighborhood school. In the last two yearsP.S. 34 has been expanded to eighth gradehoping to keep the families in the district until the children are ready to go to high school.

Many parents at the Neighborhood School say they would like their school to do the same.

At the Neighborhood Schoolwhich has grown increasingly popular over the yearsthe atmosphere is folksy and informal. Its philosophy is so egalitarian that the school shies away from celebrating any holidaysfor fear of offending someone. It shunned textbooks for many yearsthough social studies and math books have begun to creep into classroomsas parents complained that without a textit was hard for them to help their children at home.

Parents can follow the curriculum through letters sent home by every teacher. In kindergartenchildren write that they have been feeding food scraps to their worms and sketching trees in Tompkins Square Park. In sixth gradechildren plan to write a screenplay based on the Salem witch trials.

It is hard to walk down the halls without bumping into a mother or father.

 3350,  2000, a, The nation's largest operator of welfare-to-work programs violated federal law by paying lower wages to women than to men placed in the same jobs in a Milwaukee warehouseaccording to a decision made public yesterday by the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

The companyMaximus Inc.has been under mounting criticism for its business practices in recent months. A state judge in Manhattan has held up the Giuliani administration's plans to award Maximus more than $100 million in contracts to help welfare recipients find work. And state auditors in Wisconsin recently found that the company had billed the state for $466,000 in improper or questionable expenses.

The federal commission's ruling found that a woman placed in warehouse jobs by MaxStaffthe company's temporary employment agencywas paid $7.01 an hour while five male co-workers got $8.13.

''We're obviously very disappointed with the determination,'' said Rachael Rowlanda spokeswoman for Maximus. ''We respectfully disagree with it. We remain confident that no discrimination occurred in this case.''

Scientists have turned up ample evidence that consumption of seafood high in omega-3 fatty acids may help protect against cardiovascular disease. But the data have usually been indirectgleaned from food questionnaires used to estimate consumption.

But now a new analysis relying on blood tests and years of clinical exams confirms that higher blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk for heart disease and death in people over age 65.

The blood tests were used to track the levels of three different types of omega-3 in 2,692 randomly selected peopleaverage age 74 at the start of the studyfor 14 years. All were generally healthy and without previous heart disease. None used fish oil supplements.

The study was published online Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine.

There were 1,625 deaths over the 14-year study period. The highest blood levels of the three kinds of omega-3individually and combinedwere associated with the lowest total mortalityand there was a dose-response relationship — that isas blood levels of omega-3 went upthe risk for death declined.

After adjustment for a number of variablesthose in the highest 20 percent in omega-3 blood levels were 27 percent less likely to die of any cause than those in the lowest fifth. Those with blood levels in the highest fifth were also 40 percent less likely to die of coronary heart diseaseand 48 percent less likely to die of an arrhythmia than those in the lowest fifth.

There were fewer deaths from stroke in those with the highest levels of omega-3sbut the difference was not statistically significant. Over allthe researchers calculated that those with the highest omega-3 blood levels lived an average of 2.22 more years than those with lowest.

The lead authorDr. Dariush Mozaffarianan associate professor of medicine at Harvardsaid that the most beneficial levels could be achieved by consuming an average of 400 milligrams of omega-3s a day — the equivalent of weekly consumption of about 3.5 ounces of farmed salmon5 ounces of anchovies or herringor 15 to 18 ounces of cod or catfish.

While greater amounts may have some additional benefitshe said“The most bang for the buck is going from zero to some.”

Controlled trials have shown that omega-3 fatty acids have various beneficial physiological effectsamong them reduced heart ratelower blood pressure and lower triglyceride production. These effects are modestthe researchers saybut combined they could reduce mortality.

Dr. Kenneth J. Mukamalan assistant professor of medicine at Harvardwho was not involved in the studysaid the work confirmed “older clinical trials showing just this — that omega-3 oil prevented sudden cardiac death.”

The finding that omega-3 levels were associated with lowered risk for death by specific causesDr. Mozaffarian saidis novel and important.

“The specificity for heart disease and arrhythmias is very compelling for this being a cause-and-effect relationship,” he saidrather than an association based on general good health or other lifestyle factors.

Stillthe authors acknowledge that there may be other variables they were unable to account for.

Would omega-3 supplements work just as well as eating fish? “Some previous trials of supplements showed benefits,” Dr. Mozaffarian said. “Some more recent have not. So I think it’s a little uncertain what’s going on.”

In any casehe saidsupplements may be the answer for some people: “If you don’t eat fishtake supplementsand if you want to take supplements in addition to eating fishno harm in doing that.”

 4186,  1995, a, Dr. Chernofsky told his family that his brain had been deprived of oxygen for 8 to 13 minutesaccording to family members who provided details of the case. Brain cells start to die after five minutes without oxygen. A CAT scan a week or so after the accident showed a severe brain injury that left Lloyd Reback where he lies todayin an irreversible coma at Hilltop Manora rehabilitation hospital for brain-injured patients near SchenectadyN.Y. The Runner Minor Surgery Had Fatal Results

Denise Verbeeck's knee surgery was the kind of minor outpatient operation that occurs at thousands of hospitals across the country every day. Her orthopedic surgeonDr. Neil Watnikhad told Ms. Verbeeck that the operation on her kneecap should take less than two hoursher sister Debbie saidand that she should expect to stay with her parents through a few weeks of recovery. Though mildly retardedMs. Verbeeck worked and lived independently in a group home in CommackL.I. She had won several medals in past Special Olympics and hoped to resume running this summer.

The surgery on Ms. Verbeeck's knee was a successbut like Mr. Rebackshe got into trouble in the recovery room. Ms. Verbeeck's medical records were made available by her family.

The anesthesiologistDr. Nalini Prasadnoted in the patient's chart that the anatomy of Ms. Verbeeck's mouth and chin might make the insertion of the tube difficult. As a resultthe doctor had to place it through Ms. Verbeeck's nose instead of her mouthguiding it into the lungs with the aid of a tiny fiber-optic scope.

The anesthesiologist removed the tube shortly after the surgerynoting that the patient was awakeand transferred her to the recovery room. She told Ms. Verbeeck's family that Ms. Verbeeck had said she was happy to have the tube out and complained that her knee hurt.

But soon afterwardthe monitors tracking the oxygen in her blood showed abnormally low levels. And by the afternoonwhen her oxygen levels dropped further and she began to cough up bright red blooddoctors from the intensive-care unit were called. The exact problem that led to Ms. Verbeeck's death or whoif anyoneis responsibleis still unclearand her autopsy has not yet been completed. Dr. Prasadthrough the hospitaldeclined to comment. But a chest X-ray that afternoon showed that she had pneumonia in both lungsand notes in the chart by several doctors diagnose the problem as blood or stomach contents entering her lungs before or after surgery.

The passage of solids or liquids into the lungsknown as aspirationis a potential complication of any general anesthesiawhich blocks the body's gag reflex. But it is the anesthesiologist's mission to prevent it. Aspiration can occur when a patient is overly sedated before receiving a breathing tubeor when the tube is removed prematurelybefore the gag reflex has returned. Aspiration occurs in 1 in 12,000 patients receiving elective surgeryand 1 in 70,000 dies.

 5206,  1988, a, The official hiring of John Cooper as head football coach at Ohio State yesterday ended six weeks of uncertainty for the Buckeye players. Cooper was introduced to them by officials of the school as the replacement for Earle Bruce only a day after he coached Arizona State to a 33-28 victory over Air Force in the Freedom Bowl.

Bruce was dismissed Nov. 16 by Edward Jenningsthe president of Ohio Statewith a year left on his contract. He sued the school for $7.4 million for breach of contract and agreed to a $471,000 settlement.

''We were all just a little bit surprised over the way Coach Bruce was fired,'' said Derek Isamana starting defensive player. ''Now we can get this all over with and play ball.''

''I don't think there will be any animosity toward a new coach,'' said Joe Staysniaka starting offensive tacklewho added that he had fond memories of Bruce and bitter memories of the way he was dismissed.
 2767,  2003, a, The economic summit that begins today in the French Alps -- the first meeting since the war in Iraq between Mr. Bush and European leaders who opposed it -- is the start of a new effort to revive globalization. It is the annual meeting of the Group of 8which includes BritainCanadaFranceGermanyItalyJapanRussia and the United States.

Beyond the disagreements over Iraqthe United States and Europe have had a number of clashes over trade. Europefor exampleopposed genetically modified foods and criticized steel tariffs and tax benefits for exporters like Boeing in the United States. The recent decline in the dollar has also made life difficult for European companies that had become accustomed to the effective price edge on their goods while the dollar was higher.

After the Évian meetingthe next step in the trade talksknown as the Doha roundwill be in CancúnMexicoin September. In Cancúndifferences over agricultural subsidies and drug patents will be more clearly on display than they are this weekas negotiatorswho have fallen behind scheduledetermine whether they can meet their own deadline of signing a new pact by 2005.

In the meantimeofficials from the United States and Latin America will continue their fitful discussions about creating a trade zone for the Western Hemisphere similar to one that exists in North America.

''All the trade negotiations are in trouble,'' said Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr.the president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington and a former trade negotiator. The steps taken during the last decade ''have been so successful that we've gotten down to the finaldifficult issues.''

Bush administration officials take a more positive viewsaying they remain committed free traders despite their support last year for new steel tariffs and farm subsidies. Officials cite successes in the war on terrorismwhich they say are removing a major obstacle to the movement of people and goodsand recent trade pacts with Chile and Singapore. Those pacts are part of a strategy that Robert B. Zoellickthe United States trade representativecalls competitive liberalizationin which the administration seeks to maintain free-trade momentumeven if global talks bog down.

John B. Taylorthe under secretary of the Treasury in charge of international affairssaid: ''You take steps forward and move back. That's always the case.'' Over allhe added''the trends are good.''

 5624,  1986, a, Roger Hallthe head of United Airlines' pilotsis a man without many admirers these days.

To Donald C. Burrthe chairman of People Express Inc.Mr. Hall is the official of that ''unresponsive and inflexible'' union that drove the final nail into Frontier Airlines's coffin -and perhaps one or two into that of its ailing parentPeople Express. Newark-based People had been trying to sell its money-losing Denver-based subsidiary to seal off a cash drain and gets its hands on some much-needed cash.

To United's leadersMr. Hall is the hard-nosed politician who killed their plans to buy Frontier from People because it did not serve his constituency's interest.

And to many of the 4,700 bitter former employees of Frontierwhich is now in bankruptcyMr. Hall is the man who promised he would save their jobs and then did not.

Howeverto hear Mr. Hall tell ithe has been set up as a scapegoat by United's Machiavellian leaderswhohe contendsnever intended to buy Frontier in the first place. Given his aspirations to be elected the next leader of the Air Line Pilots Association in Novemberhe acknowledgedhis image problem could not have happened at a worse time. Effect on Candidacy

 3803,  1997, a, In the modern annals of political warfareno leader had been more effective than Yasir Arafat. He used its techniques and strategies to achieve major goals against an enemy far stronger militarily. But despite his successesonce again his character and ambitions have led Palestinians to the brink of disaster.

The Arafat techniques include an international propaganda campaign that made much of the world accept as truth the fiction that a part of Jerusalem is already a city in itselfwith an Arab majoritybelonging to Palestinians by history and right. Arab Jerusalemor East Jerusalemthey call it.

Any action by Israel to defend its interests and sovereignty in that fictitious citylike opening a second door in an archeological tunnel or building apartments for Jewsis denounced by Mr. Arafat and countries around the world as provocation and justification for Arab riots and terrorist murders.

Terrorism is a built-in part of Mr. Arafat's political warfare. The technique is to promise to give it up as a weapon against the Jews. Collect for the promise. Then break it when necessary to put more pressure on Israel. Make the promise again. Collect.

 147,  2018, a, On the morning of March 312016I put on a pair of Gap jeans (the ones without holes); a beige silky top I’d bought at the Gap outlet in SedonaAriz.where I had briefly lived; and a short-waisted gray zip-up jacket. I parted my hair on the rightas I always doand put it up in a messy bun. I never wear makeupso I also didn’t wear makeup. Laterof courseI would wear makeup. I was on my way to deliver an 11-page account of sexual harassment by my former graduate school adviser. I wanted to look good. I also wanted to look credible.

Over the course of the last year and a halfsince filing that reportI have been asked to participate in a number of legalsemi-legal and legal-adjacent events. Among the processes that can be involved when a person files a sexual harassment complaint in an academic setting are the following: investigation interviews with a Title IX coordinator; appearances at school-sponsored forums where a person may hide in the back while attempting to keep her heart rate manageable as she listens to lots of powerful people proudly talking about what a great job they’re doing despite the person making accusations hearing nothing from any of them and quite frankly having no idea what’s going on; newspaper photo shoots; television appearances; short impromptu speeches in front of a crowd of fellow students who had just learned their professor was accused of sexual harassment; meetings with a lawyer; meetings with the lawyer’s partner lawyer; meetings with a number of lawyerssome of whom may be moderately annoyed with you; meetings with the department chairwho will refuse to speak to you for inexplicable reasons; andfinally and perhaps most importantsix hours in front of a group of faculty who will watchcalmlyas you are excoriated. As your emails are read out loud to youwith a special emphasis on your use of exclamation points. As you are askedtriumphantlyabout that time in your early 20s that you dated someone older than you.

Over the last year and a halfI have needed a lot of outfits. I have also needed to be consistent. I have needed to be readyat every momentto be seen as both a poverty-stricken graduate student and a reliable adult. As an accuserI need to be a news-team-ready correspondent and someone who certainly wasn’t doing this for the limelight. I didn’t know any of this when I started. I learned this all on the full-time job that is being an objector to sexual harassment in America.

Some of what I learned to wear I learned on my ownby thinking to myself about what I needed to exhibit. Some of it — you must always put your hair up and never show any skin — came from a politically savvy friend. She is the reason I’m wearing a black turtleneck on four news shows. I refused to be photographed at homeor sitting down. I wanted to project strengthand also a kind of neutrality.

But at the timeI just wanted to be credible. Strong. I didn’t want to look like what I imagined a victim looks like. I didn’t want to look so downtrodden that I would look obsessed with being a victimas it was suggested. I didn’t want to look so feminine and girlish that I wouldn’t be taken seriously; I’d seen the way young-looking women are treated. And yetI didn’t want to look too aggressivetoo much like a “rabble-rouser” with an “agenda.” Of course I had been cautioned about that.

For that photo shoot I wore the same jacket that I wore to report. I did try to expand my wardrobegoing to J. Crew the day before the shoot. Sayingin the shop“I need something that looks like I’m destroying the patriarchy,” didn’t lead us in a lot of helpful directionsandbesidesI didn’t want to wear a blazer — particularly not a freshly pressed new one. That would make me look like a rich personnot a beleaguered graduate student. It has been important to show that I am but a simple lowly student. It takes a measure of hapless powerlessness.

I have not been as powerless behind the scenes. When I realized the university wasn’t doing anything on its ownI hired a lawyer to help exert a little pressure. The first time I met with herI wore orange suede J. Crew loafers. My friend Jessie Conradi came with me. She’s a lawyertoo; she was also wearing loafers. We took a picture of our shoesposted it to Instagram and tagged it “loafers of justice.”

One of the things that’s been most challenging is the confidentiality that a legal proceeding requires. When I couldn’t outright say what I was doingI could at least post loafer pics. I also wanted to show my lawyer thatheyI might be crushed under the weight of the patriarchy but I can also beyou knowfun. I’d seen too much skepticism around victims. Felt the ripple in the air when a woman starts telling her story. Surewe might believe that she’s been harassed. But the later effects of being harassedthe subtlermore insidious and downstream effects — the way in which I started to wonder who was with me and who was against me; the lack of trust I could feel myself developing for almost everyone I encountered in the halls of my former department; the shame I felt at being told that my former cohort had mostly abandoned my cause; my double shame at using words like “shame” and “abandon” — are the forces my clothing is fighting against.

When I filed my complaintI had already been through a life-threateningand publicillness. Being a sexual harassment complainant feltoftenlike just too much. No wonder I wanted to seem like the coolest cucumber in town.

I learned many things about the lawone of which is that there comes a time where a case may move to litigationor not! Sometimes that decision comes as a collective choice. On a Thursday night in Octoberafter meeting with my lawyer and going over my experiencesI stopped at the Westfield Center in San Francisco. Michael Korsfirst — I got my purse thereand I believe it makes me look like a real grown-up. I walked inignoring the studded fur vestsand was asked if I needed help.

I hadn’t really learned from my J. Crew experience and tried a similar opening gambit. “I need something that will help bring the patriarchy down,” I said. The helpful salesperson pointed me in the direction of a tight black knee-length dressdotted with metallic studs. “Maybe for afterwhen it’s all done,” I said.

I tried the same line at Club Monacowhere I found better reception. “I need something that’ll make me look crediblebut not superrich,” I said. I hoped I wasn’t insulting the place (I grew up in Canadahome of the original store; I’m incapable of insulting it). My vaguely enthusiastic interlocutor — I wish I could have told her morebut the law prevented me — brought me a pair of black dress pants that were short enough to work on my actually kind of short legs and a gray V-neck sweater with black blocks on the sleeves. The gray and black were just exciting enough to say“HeyI’m a person with personality!” The black pants were just professional enough to show that I was taking things seriously.

“These’ll work,” I said to her. At homeI added a white collared shirt — Banana Republic — underneath and thento show that I hadn’t been completely subjugated by the deafening silence in the aftermath of the initial investigation’s completionmy Banana Republic polka-dot loafers. After years of being a J. Crew-only girlI’d both turned 35 and realized that Banana Republic was actually where it’s at.

You know where else it’s at? The Alexander Wang bootees with rose gold that I bought for myself at the beginning of the semesterwhen I knew it would be a tough couple of quasi-legal months. They were my Wonder Woman-inspired bootsmy “I can do this” boots. They were the most expensive thing I’ve ever bought for myselfand that includes my wedding dress. Yet I’ve mostly left them in my closet. I wish that we lived in a world where I could both wear high-heeled gold-detailed boots and be utterly reliable and crediblebut the patriarchy is still too strong. Talk about a narrow path to victory.

The coup de grâcethoughwas in November. The protocol for sexual harassment cases at the University of CaliforniaBerkeley that are found to have violated the faculty code of conduct is that the defendant is charged with a sanction. This can include dismissal. This happens after the completion of first a Title IX investigation and then an internal investigation. Then comes a letter from the vice provostfollowed by multiple opportunities for settling or a variety of face-saving resignationsincluding that of Geoff Marcya Berkeley astronomy professor.

This is all outlined in the very helpful Academic Senate manualwhich I have read many times in an effort to find the answers that no one employed by the university will give me. It is my understanding that these hearings are basically like courtrooms — where the plaintiff is the administration and the defendant is the accused. When the University of California professor Blake Wentworth was firedit was after an Academic Senate committee hearing.

I can’t say whether I participated in such a hearingbut I can say that on the morning of Nov. 2 I carefully showeredsprayed my hair with leave-in conditionerput on my VPL-free underwear I’d bought the year before at Uniqloput on those same Club Monaco dress pantsand took the black and gray sweater out of its drawer.

But what shirt? The day beforeas seems to be habitI’d gone to Anthropologie and Madewell in Berkeley. Anthropologie didn’t find me any clothesthough I did buy a $7 sea salt bath bar and four face masks. (It’s good to have pearly bright skin if you’re ever in a position where your credibility may be at stake.) At MadewellI bought a short-sleeved gray flannel collared shirt and a black button-down printed with gold stars. I obviously wanted to wear the star shirt — if nothing elsethis experience has brought me face to face with my own brightness — but it was too bulky for the sweater. And you know what they say about harassment victims with visible shirttails: They’re lying.

I played it relatively safe and went with a classica purple checked J. Crew shirt I’d bought years before; I discoveredonce I posted it on Instagram for something elsethat it’s known as #thatjcrewshirt. Andagainthose polka-dot loafers.

That day I recounted my history as a drug addictsomething I’m very open about but seems never to fail to entertain at least some lawyers; I recalled within earshot of a group of assorted faculty that yesI had brought my husband home with me the night I first met himand I was glad that I’d chosen the clothes I had. I was glad that I’d put my hair up in a low bunthat I’d carefully parted it to the side. I was glad that I had my perfectly fitting$169.50-but-on-sale-for-$99 Club Monaco pantsand I was also glad that my shirt collar was a little wrinkly. It showed that I’m not a perfect victim.

I’m not even very good at performing being a perfect victim. We don’t always know exactly what to say and how to bewe don’t really get a lot of training for how we should actand we’re figuring this out as we go alongand we have done things before and will do things again later that don’t fit perfectly into a narrative. Mostlyit shows that we are not a tide of anonymous women making allegationsthat we are not interchangeable.

My own legal case was settled in December of last yearbut the disciplinary case with the university continues. As I write thisI’m wearing black jeansa denim shirta gray cashmere sweater and a denim jacket. If you could see me nowdo you think you would believe me?

 118,  2019, a, Or ratherit existed the way most houses on sitcoms doin your mind’s eye. It was a collection of separate sets on a soundstageedited with exterior footage to synthesize the illusion of a warmgroovy midcentury home. Mike Brady may have been an architectbut TV supplied the home’s modular partsand your brain completed the assembly.

So like Disney Imagineers or Las Vegas casino designersHGTV set out to build something realer than real. They would rip up the house’s actualdisappointingly conventional interiorenlarge it (by 2000 square feetthey say) and make a physical manifestation of something that never existed.

“A Very Brady Renovation” feels like the logical progression ofand the perfect metaphor forthe reboot and revival craze that has brought us “Fuller House” and “Twin Peaks: The Return,” that exhumed “Veronica Mars” and “Murphy Brown.” The vast mechanism of TV and streaming has become a “Star Trek” replicator of pop culture. If I want to see Jean-Luc Picard on my TV again: Make it so!

“The Brady Bunch” is the perfect show to reboot this waybecause it has made a posthumous art of reproducing itself. Long before “Friends” liberated $100 million from Netflix’s pocketsit was the Patient Zero of TV nostalgiaextending its five-season life through rerunsspinoffsTV moviestheatrical moviescartoonsa variety showmemes (“SureJan”) and not a few tell-alls and documentaries. Its memory surpassed its actual existence.

And memory is what HGTV is selling here — wellmemory and its own brand. “A Very Brady Renovation” casts the hosts of no less than five of the network’s shows: “Good Bones,” “Restored by the Fords,” “Flea Market Flip,” “Hidden Potential” andof course“Property Brothers,” whose charismatic and ubiquitous Jonathan and Drew Scott anchor the 90-minute first episode.
 4311,  1994, a, At "The Phantom of the Opera," the Telecharge salesperson flatly said that on Saturdays "nothing is available in the center orchestra for the entire run of the show" -- despite the fact that the run is unlimited. But not even "Blood Brothers," an unprofitable production on its last legscould fill the order. No wonder tourists turn to scalpersor give up on Broadway altogether.

Mr. Koppell's job is to find out where all those tickets goand how they get there. Few in the theater doubt that ice plays a major role. Ice is the industry's term -- derived from an old machine politicians' acronym for Incidental Campaign Expenses -- for bribes paid by scalpers for prime tickets at the box office. Since Broadway box offices -- and their phone extensionslike Telecharge -- are run by the theaters' ownersnot the individual shows that are tenantsmany producers are rooting for the Attorney General to help them at last gain control of their own ticket inventory. "Shows are hosts surrounded by parasites," says a producer; he believes one theater employee collected up to $15,000 tax-free a week in ice at one of his hits.

Meanwhilefear reigns. Shortly after Mr. Koppell's investigation first leaked out in The New York Observerthe Shubert OrganizationBroadway's largest theater ownerfired the manager and box-office staff of its Philadelphia touring outpostthe Forrestbut refuses to explain why to reporters. No producer I contacted would speak about ice for attribution; one refused to talk on the phone and instructed me to meet him instead in an anonymous midtown office.

This is a crucial moment for Broadway. The pre-Tony Awards boom is on. After an abominable winterthe street's marquees are alight again with big names -- Stephen SondheimArthur MillerTommy TuneDisney. But how many plays will survive Labor Day? For the first extended period in memorynot a single Broadway showthe big musicals includedis a consistent sellout.

Smart theater people know that high ticket prices compounded by scalping are driving away business when Broadway needs every customer it can get. Smart politicians know that ticket scandals are political windfalls: Louis Lefkowitzthe Attorney General who uncovered $10 million in Broadway ice in 1963was on the front page for months. Smart New Yorkers know that Broadway's health is essential to the city's economy. With passions like these at playwho doubts that Mr. Koppell has the makings of a smash hit?

SUNDAY PUZZLE — You know what I like? I like a nicerelatively easy puzzle with a nicerelatively easy theme after a puzzle like yesterday’s Trip Payne tour de force. No math symbols. No tricks. No rebuses. Like today’s puzzle: a nicewell put-together letter-swap theme. And by Brendan Emmett Quigleyyet. That means lots of good pop culture. Just what the doctor ordered.

If you didn’t get it from the titlewe’re taking out the Bs and substituting Ps for themgiving us soundalike phrases that are clued punnily. That means that when you take the base phrase “black art” and swap out the B for a Pyou get PLAQUE ARTor “Engraving on an award.” AhI can feel my brain unclenching as I solve.

Of the theme entriesI really liked SECRET PALATE (instead of “secret ballot”)PLAQUE ARTTHAT’S MY POI (instead of “That’s my boy”) and PLAYS OF GLORY (instead of “blaze of glory”).

In nontheme newsI liked TINY TOTGIRL SHYC.W. POST (complete with a nice factoid clue: “Breakfast cereal pioneer”)RED TEA (mmmrooibos)AIRPOPI CAN’T SEEGEEZ and ACES UP.

With a Brendan Emmett Quigley puzzleit’s tough to choose a Clue of the Daybut I’m going to go with “End of a shift?” for HEMLINE.

Constructor’s Notes

I keep a Google Keep list of ideas of puzzles I’d like to develop into puzzles. These ideas come at all sorts of timesout with my three-year old Tabithaor shoppingor both. Sometimes they’re practically fully formed themes: here’s the gimmickhere’s most of the answersboom. Othertimesthey’re a couple of seed entries for a themeless puzzle. And then there’s the one’s I like to call “theme answers in search of theme.” These are random turns of phrases that made me laugh for whatever reason but they’re not apparently obvious what to do with them. Today’s offering stemmed from that. A while back I’d written a note that read THE POISE ARE BACK IN TOWN.

I’ve heard the song “Bali Hai” way too many times (long story involving a school play and unexpected theater tickets) to post it hereso I’m going to go with this King Crimson song to end our solving week:

 5413,  1987, a, Fin swimmingin which competitors use rubber fins to add a powerful boost to their kickis a fast sport that has been making slow progress in the United States since it was imported from Europe a few years ago. Now one version of it seems to have reached its high-water mark.

The first United States Eastern Fin Swimming Championshipsheld March 21 at Westchester Community College in ValhallaN.Y.were also billed as the first such meet anywhere in a short-course pool (25 yards) rather than in a 50-meter long-course. As a result of the experiencethey may be the last. As the 15 entrants discoveredthe speed advantage that fin swimming enjoys over barefoot swimming on long courses disappears when a short course is usedand for an obvious reason: The flippers that add so much power to a kick are a distinct disadvantage in making a flip turn.

In long-course eventsthe superiority of fins is substantial. For examplethe world 50-meter freestyle record is 22.33 secondswhile the fin swimming record for the same event is a blistering 15.4. In the 100the world swimming record is 48.74while the fin swimming record is 38.2. (Fin recordsincidentallywould presumably be even lower if the best swimmers took up the sport. As it isfin swimmers tend to be scuba divers.) In the Eastern championshipsGary Antonick of Virgina Beach won the one-flip-turn 50-yard apneaan underwater eventin 18.1 secondsonly slightly faster than the American swimming record of 19.22. Peppo Biscarini of Los Angeleswho had to use his flippers for three flip turnswon the 100-yard event in 43.3 secondsactually slower than the finless record of 41.87.

The meet organizerFrank Maywho settled on the 25-yard Westchester pool only because there were no Olympic-size pools available in the metropolitan areasaid later that he wasn't sure about an encore next year. In the meantimehe figures that the 1987 championships were a watershed: Every winner set a short-course record.
 709,  2015, a, A library tradition is being refashioned to emphasize early literacy and better prepare young children for schooland drawing many new fans in the process.
 2343,  2005, a, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg praised the city's public hospitals yesterdayasserting that the quality of care they provide is so good that poor New Yorkers receive better medical service than wealthy patients at private hospitals. Speaking at an interfaith prayer breakfast at the New York Public Librarythe mayor was extolling the virtues of living in New York City when he mentioned the quality of service offered by the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation. He said the city's public hospitals and medical centers "are something I am so proud of."

"This city has 11 public hospitalsand every rating agency says these are the best hospitalsbetter than the great teaching hospitals we have in this city," Mr. Bloomberg said. "Medical care in this city is arguably one of the few services you can point to any place in the world where the poor get better services than the wealthy. It really is true. If you get sick you go to a public hospital. Every single number shows we've done a spectacular job."

Mr. Bloomberg's enthusiasm has been on display beforeand health care is a favorite topic of his. Amid budget cuts elsewherehe increased city funds for public hospitalsand he has contributed millions of his personal fortune for a school of public health at his alma materJohns Hopkins University.

But his claim that the city-run hospitals are superior -- and that as a result their mostly poor patients receive better care than people who go to private hospitals -- proved difficult to test. Yesterday being observed as a holidayofficials at several large private hospitals were not available to comment. Nor were federal officials who collect Medicare and Medicaid data.

 4072,  1996, a, But open warfare has not yet been declaredbecause prosecutorsas well as defense lawyersmust depend on judgesin the peculiarat times pernicious symbiosis that is the criminal justice system. Justice Leavitt is now presiding over one of the District Attorney's high-profile casesthe prosecution of Richard D. DiGuglielmoa white off-duty police officer who shot a black man who parked in front of the officer's father's delicatessen in what has been described as a bias incident.

And if Mr. Rukaj is indicted and the case goes to trialprosecutors may well have to call Justice Leavitt to testify. ''I imagine the trial attorneys will question me differently than they would an ordinary witness,'' the judge said.

Ms. Pirro would give no corner. ''My trial attorneys are very savvy and well seasoned and are not intimidated by any witnesswhether they are in a robea uniformor prison garb,'' she said stiffly.

Westchester County defense lawyers characterize the judgewho was elected to the bench as a Republican in 1993as independent mindedand not one they necessarily consider to be generous at sentencing. ''He can be harsher on drunk-driving cases than other judges because of his ambulance experience,'' said Rebecca Schenka Legal Aid lawyer.

Justice Leavitt does not disagree; he has recused himself from drunken-driving cases when he was in the ambulance at the scene. He concurs that his experiences off the bench do influence the perspective he brings to some crimes. ''You watch a child clutching a favorite blanket while their house is burning and you hear an arson case differently,'' he said.

''I often ask prosecutors: have you notified the victims that they can speak at sentencing?'' he said. ''I'd like to bring every prosecutor to the E.R. and say'This is a victimthis is what they look like -- you can't understand what they've suffered unless you see them.' ''

Justice Leavittwho was born in Brooklynbegan his legal career as a prosecutorfirst in Brooklyn and later in Westchester. When he decided to go into private practicehe was advised that one way to become known in Chappaquawhere he had moved with his wife and daughterswas to start volunteering.

The decision came in a case brought by the National As sociation of Letter Carriers against Postmaster General Winton M. Blount several months before the postal work ers’ strike last March.

No explanation was given for abandoning the appeal be yond a brief statement from Solicitor General Erwin N. Griswold and John W. Karrttorney for the unionthat both parties had agreed that the ap peal should be dismissed. The Post Office had no comment.

 4364,  1994, a, In its glorythe Bronx Democratic machine was the domain of bosses named Flynn and Buckleywhose voices reverberated from the Grand Concourse to Pennsylvania Avenue. And in its shamethe weakened machine of the 1980's was scandalized by the jailing of politicians named Simon and Friedman.

Nowwith the machine age of politics dead and the Bronx reborn by new waves of immigrantsthe leadership of the once fabled and feared Democratic Party organization has passed to a man named Ramirez.

The election of Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez last week as the first Hispanic county political chairman in the state is a sign of ever-molting city politicswith one ethnic group shedding power and others moving to the fore. In this casethe change is a victory for Hispanic politiciansmost notably for Fernando Ferrerthe Bronx Borough Presidentwho is widely considered a likely challenger to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in 1997.

But it is an indication of the feeble health of once-powerful political organizations in the city that when Mr. Ramirez ran for the citywide post of public advocate last yearthe Bronx party apparatus couldn't even turn out enough votes for him to carry the borough.

 3025,  2002, a, Tom Golisanothe billionaire whose campaign commercials seem to be on the air every other minutescaled back his advertising in the New York metropolitan area yesterday and is instead concentrating his efforts upstatehis media adviser said yesterday.

The Associated Press reported that officials at several television stations said Mr. Golisanothe Independence Party candidatehad canceled heavy advertising scheduled to appear in the city Monday and Tuesday. The report also said he was canceling ads upstatebut his campaign officials said that was not the case. They did confirm that he was cutting back significantly in the city and its suburbshowever. His adviserErick Mullensaid that the campaign's polls showed that Mr. Golisano had met his targets in the city and its suburbs.

The news set off widespread speculationthe vigor of which could be interpreted as indicative of the general lack of suspense in the governor's race. Had Mr. Golisano decided to become frugal and stop investing his considerable personal wealth in his campaign commercials? Was he making new advertisements for the city? Or was he throwing in the towel after a new public poll showed him much further behind than his internal polls?

Some analysts believed that his move could help H. Carl McCallthe Democratic candidate who is trying to solidify support in the city.

 2955,  2002, a, In a move that CNN said was unrelated to the controversyit also began a five-part series on the victims of suicide bombers on the CNN service shown on Israel and around the worldCNN Internationalwith Wolf Blitzer as its host.

Taken togetherthe moves were interpreted by Israeli and Palestinian officialsmedia critics and reporters covering the conflict as an appeasement of CNN's critics in Israel and the United States.

And they have led to bad feelings among some inside CNN. ''It appears as if we're in an unseemly rush to try to fix thingsand I think we're going to dig ourselves into a deeper hole if we continue this course,'' said one CNN staff member in Jerusalemwho said complaints from Israelis to the office there were coming through loudest and with the most ferocity.

CNN executives said they were not appeasing criticsbutrathersetting the record straight on Mr. Turner and emphasizing that CNN's coverage was fair. They said two suicide bombings on two consecutive days last month that killed 26 in Jerusalem -- the same week Mr. Turner's comments were published -- persuaded them to put together the series on Israeli terrorism victims.

''People who are really examining the issues closely would see CNN is doing first-rate journalistic work,'' Mr. Jordan said. ''And we are not going to kowtow to one side or the other.''

Stillthe series drew complaints from Palestinians. ''Do we have to pay for the statements of Ted Turner?'' said Saeb Erekatthe chief Palestinian negotiator. ''I can't believe that CNN is giving five segments a half-hour each to the Israelis without the courtesy of showing one segment on the Palestinian victims. I hate to see that the pressure on CNN has affected their objectivityas reflected in the Blitzer report.'' He said CNN should do a similar series on civilian Palestinian victims of Israeli military operations. CNN said it regularly covered the plights of Palestinian victims.

For CNN's many critics in Israelhoweverthe series was a long time coming. ''What's happened here in the past two years -- the coverage was not according to journalistic standards,'' a government official saidadding that during Israel's recent military campaign to root terrorists out of Palestinian neighborhoods''CNN took almost totally the Palestinian line.''

 3113,  2001, a, The op-ed results suggest that an argument is raging in the country. But the journalistic sorting out of the facts that should inform that argument has diminished.

The deeper connections between Mr. Bush's political vision and the country that are most intriguing and significant are largely absent in the press treatment. Despite so tenuous a mandate for his bold conservative agendathe press has largely ignored the subject of his relationship to the American public. Indeedin Mr. Bush's first two months in officethe news outlets we surveyed featured only half as many stories on how presidential policies relate to the American people as they did in Mr. Clinton's early days.

The coveragealready shrunkenhas focused on the most obvious and routine elements of Mr. Bush's new tenure.

In his first month the coverage was positive. It focused on quick judgments about whether Mr. Bush was up to the job -- and declared that the answerafter low expectationswas yes.

In the second month the coverage turned more critical as Mr. Bush's budget plan began to move through Congress. The coverage turned more negativehowevernot because it keenly considered where the president wanted to take the country and how this would affect peoplebut because the budget plan seemed entangled in Congress. Mr. Bush's ideasin other wordsare being dealt with on the level probably least interesting to citizens -- the level of political jockeying.

What is missing in the picture are answers to the deeper questions most citizens -- except perhaps news junkies -- are concerned with: What change will the election and the crisis over voting bring? What are the implications of a president who lost the popular vote attempting to govern as if he had won it by a wide margin? How is it that Mr. Busha man depicted during the campaign as an affable deal maker not too concerned with policyhas emerged in the coverage as a sincere conservative willing to stake out a controversial agenda because he is so committed ideologically?

The consequences of the press further pulling back its coverage of the public debate -- now even of the White House -- are not trivial. Shrunken coverage leads to a shallower public understandingmore chance of abuse by special interests and less chance for the country to resolve its most difficult problems.

Not long agoDavid Shribmana journalist with The Boston Globereminded a group of journalism executives of how parents often define character for their children: it's how you act when no one is looking. The definition of character in journalismMr. Shribman saidwas whether we cover stories we think people aren't paying attention tobut should be.

 1150,  2012, a, The nominations for the new president of the World Bank are closed. For the next several weeks the board of directors will be considering three candidates:

· Ngozi Okonjo-Iwealaa Nigerianhas a doctorate in regional economics and development from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She was the managing director of the World Bank from 2007 to 2011 and is currently the finance minister of Nigeria. Many think she’s the natural choice for the next president. Her appointment would mean that a woman would lead the World Bank at the same time that a woman heads the International Monetary Fund

· José Antonio Ocampoa Colombianhas been the United Nations under-secretary general for Economics & Social Affairs and the finance minister of Colombia. He has a doctorate in economics from Yale University and is currently a professor at Columbia University’s School of International & Public Affairs in New York. He is known for leading Colombia through Latin America’s financial crisis.

· Jim Yong Kima Korean-Americanis a medical doctor and also has a Ph.D. in anthropology from Harvard University. He was a founder of Partners in Healtha nonprofit agency that developed a successfulreplicable model to provide health care to the poor. He is president of Dartmouth College and is President Barack Obama’s choice for president of the World Bank.

Normally that would be enough. Since the World Bank’s inception in 1944the president has always been an American because the United States is the largest stakeholder in the bank. Howeverthe World Bank Group consists of 187 countriesand its main objective now is to loan money to poor countries. With the waning of the American economy and the waxing of developing countriespeople have begun to wonder if the next president should come from outside the United Statesperhaps from the developing world.

Jeffrey Sachs wrote an op-ed arguing for a non-American president: “For too longthe bank’s leadership has imposed U.S. concepts that are often utterly inappropriate for the poorest countries and their poorest people.”

Others have suggested the most qualified person be selectedregardless of nationality. An op-ed by three former World Bank executives (Francois BourguignonNicholas Stern and Joseph Stiglitz) said: “Let the competition be open; let the U.S. and Europe live up to their words and let them behave as if it really is a World Bank.”

Last weekthe leaders of the BRICS countries mooted the idea of starting a separate development bank.

In such a climate and in these egalitarian times where we all can put in our 2 cents (or 1 rupee) via the Internetwho would you choose for the president of the World Bank? And what is the basis for your choice? Would you choose based on nationality or merit? Would you choose an academica politiciana financiera development expert or someone with a variety of experience? Would you decide based on whether they came from a developed country or a rising economy?

Here are some of the names being discussed: Hillary Rodham Clinton (U.S. secretary of state)Indra Nooyi (C.E.O. of PepsiCo)Timothy F. Geithner (U.S. secretary of the treasury)Muhammad Yunus (Bangladeshi economista.k.a. “Banker to the Poor”)and Mr. Sachs (American economistU.N. adviser and founder of Millennium Promise Alliance). Or you may choose from among the official nominees.

Who would be your choice for the next president of the World Bankand why?

 53,  2019, a, Stillwherever Lopez goeshe is never far from a disquisition on humanity’s merciless ways. Rising from his bed one night in the tropical heat of Isla Santa Cruzin the Galápagoshe walks alone (a frequent habit that makes for some of the book’s best bits) to the beach and watches a group of brown pelicans asleep on the bay. The birds’ vulnerability — “oblivious just now to all that is hidden and potentially threatening in the lightless world we share” — leads his train of thought to Spanish conquistadores releasing vicious dogs on Indiansand from there to the European bankers who underwrote the slave trade in West Africaand on to the present horrors of Boko Haram. It’s allultimatelyin the service of pondering the roots of barbarismand how we ignore the barbarism unfolding in our own society at our peril.

[ Read our round-up of recent books about climate change. ]

Strangelythoughthese relentless reminders of egregious acts don’t diminish the appeal of seeing the world through Lopez’s eyes. His reverence for exploring every corner of the worldeven the sites of its most shameful historiesis infectious. Rarely does Lopez decline an offer of adventureno matter how potentially grueling the trip might be. Travelinghe writes“turns the mind toward a consideration of context and releases it from the dictatorship of absolute truths about humanity. It helps one understand that all people do not want to be on the same road.”

Lopez’s journeys often start in ways that make you shake your head. (More than a few trips begin with a banal sentence like: “In the austral fall of 1987 I was traveling through Namibia with a few people.” You knowas one does.) One night he reads a paper in the scientific journal Nature about the discovery of some 4.27-billion-year-old zircon crystals in remote Western Australia. He immediately emails the researchers about visiting the field site — because he just happens to be headed to Perth soon“en route from Zimbabwe to the Northern Territory.”

The scientists initially ignore his request. But he persistsand several years later he’s finally on his way to the Jack Hills. He flies from the United States to Sydneyand then goes by train to Perthpersuading the engineers to let him ride in the locomotive. One daycrossing the vast Nullarbor Plain“the train suddenly ran into a wall of water,” a drenching rainstorm. When the weather clearsa double rainbow appears. And then a mob of kangaroos arrivesover a hundred of themleaping across the plain. “The sight of it was so exhilarating the three of us in the cab nodded an affirmation to one another. Whatever was wild and lyrical in the timeless worldwe were in the middle of it now.”

Lopez proceeds in a rented four-wheel drive to a sheep-ranching outpost where a geologist has arranged lodging120 miles from the nearest town “on an unsigned dirt track.” When he arrivesthe rancher and his daughter have “a meat pie in the ovenand he wanted to know whether I took milk with my tea.” One dayas Lopez is heading out to the geology sitethe rancher offers him a rifle and asks if he’d mind shooting any wild goats he encounters. Lopez declines. But through evening chats on the verandathe two men form a bond; the rancher ultimately visits Lopez at home in Oregon. This knack for making friends in the most unlikely places resonates long after you turn the last page. “Are we not bound,” he asks“to learn how to speak with each other?”

Had we mastered that skill 30-odd years agowould we be where we find ourselves todaygrappling with violent xenophobia while forests incinerateoceans rise and acidifymagnificent organisms everywhere fade away? Where will we be three decades onif we don’t take heed? There is still timethough not as much as there once wasto shape what’s coming.

We’re in Beijing — noBeiping — Dec. 101979. It’s year two of the presidency of Chiang Ching-kuoson of Chiang Kai-shek. China has been an American ally since Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintangor Nationalistforces defeated Mao’s Communists in the civil war that ended in 1949. The Chinese capital is still Nanjing. The Dalai Lama remains in Lhasa. Hong Kong is a British colonial backwater. China is prosperous.

Photo

It’s also repressive. Opposition parties are at most decorative; human rights advocates are hunted down. But in the 30 years since the warafter which the Communists scattered abroadmany to the Soviet UnionChina has followed a path that diverges sharply from the history we know today. No class struggleno purge of landlordsno Anti-Rightist campaign against intellectualsno Great Leap Forward or the catastrophic famine that followedno Cultural Revolution. The progress achieved in education and civil society under the Nationalists from 1911 to 1949 has continued.

Welcome to Chan Koonchung’s alternative history novel“The Second Year of Jianfeng,” recently published in Chinese in Hong Kong. (It is not yet been translated into English.) Jianfeng was the courtesy name for Chiang Ching-kuowhich Mr. Chan imagines as the name for his rule. In an interviewMr. Chan addressed the central question of his book: What if China had not gone Communist?

Q.

Could things have been different?

A.

The Chinese Communist Party insists that “history has chosen the C.C.P.,” and without the partythere would be no strong and prosperous new China. I want to show the possibility that China could have become strong and prosperous muchmuch earlier.

History is not “determined” and is not as inevitable as Communist dogma would like us to believe.

The first 30 years of Communist rule under Mao Zedongbefore Deng Xiaoping’s economic reformswere a total waste of timean unnecessary historical detour with an unspeakably immense humanitarian cost.

Q.

Would China have been better off if the Nationalists had won the civil war?



Photo

A.

China would definitely have been a nicer place. It would still have had things that were wrongbut much less than what actually happened. Such asthere wouldn’t have been a Cultural Revolution.

There are some things the Nationalists would have done worse. For examplethey were more tied to the triads. But I think that by 1979 the Nationalists would have achieved something very similar to what the Communists are achieving now37 years laterbut with more equality in society.

Q.

How difficult was it for you to construct an alternative history for China?

A.

I thought it would be very difficultbut it turned out much easier than I thought. It took less than a year to writethough I spent a lot of time preparing for it. I had to thinkhow would the Kuomintang have ruled? For that I had to think about the Taiwan elite as it was.

I picked several real people to tell the story. One was Zhang Dongsun [a philosopher and democrat who declined to take sides between the Communist and Nationalists and died in prison in Beijing in 1973]. I took the actual words they said and put them into different contexts.

Q.

How did you envision the alternative reality?

A.

I wasn’t aiming to make a utopia out of China. But maybe because of the success in TaiwanI can say that they would have done something similar to that.

Of coursethe U.S. and China would have been allies from the very start. The coastal cities of China would have boomed from 1949 onbecause the U.S. was the big economy at the time so whoever could export to the U.S. had a boom.

In Taiwan after 1949the Kuomintang did carry out land reformso I speculated that they would also have done that in China. It was very successful in Taiwanand the reason is it was nonviolent and cooperative. Landlords were made shareholders in state-owned companies and given loans. They turned into capitalists and promoted industry.

Industrialization took off after that. If they had done something similar in Chinait would have been great. The Communists did it differently. They used class struggle and killed off the old owners.

There would still have been a Korean Warbecause Kim Il-sung was very ambitious and believed he could conquer South Korea in a few days.

Q.

How would Chinese culture have fared?

A.

In 1968 [in the bookthe novelist] Lao She becomes the first Chinese writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literaturewhile in real life he was pushed to commit suicide [in 1966] during the Cultural Revolution. Old templesantiques and historic sites might simply have been neglectedinstead of willfully destroyed by the Red Guardsas happened in reality.

Q.

Are alternative history novels demanding on the reader?

A.

I didn’t explain a lot. I depended on my readers’ understanding of Chinese contemporary history to make comparisons and to enjoy reading between the lines.

 5303,  1988, a, Watching the New York City Opera's current production of ''La Traviata'' on Saturday evening at the New York State TheaterI couldn't help wondering who the company imagines its audience to be. Directed by Frank Corsarothe production is a superficially traditional look at the Verdi operawith sets and costumes that are a mismatchedhistoric pasticheand with blocking that is unlikely to awaken new insight into the characters for operagoers acquainted with the work. Newcomersmeanwhileare liable to focus on the supertitleswhich in this production provide only the sketchiest paraphrase of what is being sung.

But whatever its deficienciesthe production functions well enough as a singers' showcaseand the company used it as a vehicle for a few very fine voices. Marilyn Mimsthe soprano who sang Violettawas especially impressive. Her voice is largenicely rounded and consistently pleasant throughout the range.

It is also remarkably suppleand since Verdi gives Violetta ample opportunity for ruminationboth agitated and wistfulMs. Mims is able to show off not only her high notes but also her ability to float a limpidbeautifully shaded pianissimo line. In her long soliloquy at the end of the first act (''E strano'' through ''Sempre libera'')and again in the last act's ''Addio del passato,'' she shaped her phrases thoughtfully and expressivelyand used a rich array of vocal colors to excellent effect. Her acting is not yet as polished as her singingbut that may improve in time.

Stephen O'Mara's tenor is comparatively monochromaticparticularly toward the topbut he brought an ingenuousvulnerable quality to his portrayal of Alfredoand he went a long way to making up in his phrasing what he lacked in coloration.

 3804,  1997, a, Valentina Iribagiza had a victim's-eye view of the 1994 massacre in Rwanda. For weeksValentinaa wounded 13-year-oldlay among the dead in the church where Tutsi villagers of Nyarubuye had sought refuge from their Hutu neighbors. Along with a few other orphaned childrenshe survived. ''Valentina's Nightmare'' is darkened with memories of parentsfriends and babies stonedclubbed and hacked to death in a four-day orgy.

Valentina told her story to Fergal Keanea BBC correspondentwho brings it to ''Frontline'' tonight as an indictment of the West's refusal to intervene in whathe sayseveryone recognized was genocide. Exhorted by the state radio -- ''All Tutsi will perish; slowlyslowlyslowlywe kill them like rats'' -- Hutu bands raged across the countrymurdering hundreds of thousands of people. The result is glimpsed in the pictures of unburied corpses with which tonight's program begins.

This strong BBC report delivers some relevant backgroundbeginning with Belgian rule after World War Iwhen the minority Tutsi served the colonial power as a sort of aristocracy. With Rwandan independencetens of thousands of Tutsi were driven from the country. They returned in 1990 as a guerrilla armyand in 1993 a power-sharing arrangement was reached with the moderate Hutu PresidentJuvenal Habyarimana.

When he was killed in a plane crash in 1994Hutu Tutsi-haters went on the rampage.

It was thenMr. Keane chargesthat the Western powers retreated from their responsibility under international law to act against genocide. ''Weary of African conflicts,'' he says''the West abandoned the Tutsis to their fate.'' A State Department spokeswoman is seen at a press briefingspeaking not flatly of genocide but only of ''acts of genocide,'' a legally ambiguous formulation.

 1331,  2011, a, The makers of the Samsung SH100 digital camera are taking a literal approach to product placement in a marketing campaign that starts on Monday.

The campaigncalled the Samsung Coast to Coast Photo Postwill put a single SH100 into the hands of people in 25 cities across the country so they can use it to post photos on various social media sites like FacebookYouTube and Picasa. The campaign is intended to highlight the camera’s ability to instantly upload photos to the Websomething that an increasing number of cellphone cameras already do.

“We know consumers are increasingly sharing content,” said Reid Sullivanthe company’s senior vice president for mobile entertainment for the United Statesadding that the quality of cellphone camera photos is no match for the Samsung device.

Samsung teamed up with the digital agency Mekanism to create the campaignwhich is scheduled to start in Los Angeles and end in New York City at the end of the month. The initiative represents the first time the brand and the agency have worked together.

In order to pass the single camera from city to citya small team from Samsung will visit each location and hand over the device to a person they have deemed a “social influencer” for the day. The goal is to create “little snapshots of Americana,” Mr. Sullivan said.

Representatives from Mekanism will document the approximately 3,600-mile journey in user-generated photographsand the collection will be shown at a gallery event in June in New York City. The photo that generates the most “likes” on Facebook will be deemed the best of the bunch. Additional promotions will include product demonstration videos on YouTubein-store dealer promotions and newspaper ads.

After Sloane Stephens upended Shahar Peerthe 23rd seedon ThursdayStephens seemed less enthused with advancing to the third round and more excited about the car she planned to buy when she returned home to California.

She isafter all18.

Stephens said her performance cemented “for sure” the car purchaseas soon as the season ends. Her mother wants Stephens to buy a truck; she wants a smaller vehicle. The kicker to all thisof courseis that Stephens also said she hates to drive.

“That’s where it gets tricky,” she continued. “Seethe thing is I don’t like traffic. It’s very hard for me to drive in traffic. And my brother is the most annoying person to have in the car when you’re driving.”

There you have it. Youth. For American women in particularearly into this tournamentit has been served here. On WednesdayChristina McHale19and Irina Falconi21upset the No. 8 and No. 14 seeds.

Stephens joined them in the third round on Thursdayas did Vania King22and Serena Williams29. That makes it five American women in the third round. Williams is now the elder stateswoman.

“Fun fact,” Stephens said. “ChristinaIrina and myself are all in the third round of the U.S. Open. We’re ready to go to the topbaby. What’s up?”

Stephens is no stranger to success. Her father is the late John Stephensthe former N.F.L. running back. She won girls doubles titles at the French OpenWimbledon and the U.S. Open in 2010 and reached the girls quarterfinals or better in singles at all threetoo.

With her victory on ThursdayStephens will crack the top 100 for the first time when the next rankings come outbecoming the youngest person in the top 100. The next youngest? McHalewhom Stephens will displace.

“We’re heading in the right direction,” said Patrick McEnroethe United States Tennis Association’s general manager of player development. “I felt that this was coming. When we start getting everyone into the second weekwe’ll be there.”
 1368,  2011, a, The police state becomes total when the police become the heroes and the criminals begin policing themselves.

These are not ordinarily the values of reality televisionwhich prizes mischief and mild lawlessness and depicts police officers asat besttragic figuresshouldering responsibilities that no one else will.

“Take the Money & Run,” which begins on Tuesday on ABCupends all that. Part game show and part psychological warfareit’s a showdown involving three pairs — two contestants in the role of criminalswho stash $100,000 and hope it’s not found; two moonlighting police officers assigned to uncover it within 48 hours; and two interrogatorswho try to pry information out of the criminals with stern looks and steak dinners and lines like“You’re lying nowand you’re not real good at it.”

The criminals are regular folks hoping to earn money and TV time without having to study hard for “Jeopardy!” or demean themselves on “Wipeout.” This should be a cakewalk for them: hide shrewdlyreveal littlecollect prize. (If the cops find itthey win the money.)

But this sometimes gripping show isn’t so benign. Firstthe adversaries are worthy. The interrogators — Paul Bishopa detective and authorand Mary Hanlon Stonea deputy district attorney and author — have a flair for the dramaticand the police officers live up to their cities’ stereotypes. In the premiere the ones from San Francisco have an unhurried affability. The Miami detectives in the second episode have sharper edges; onewith slicked-back black hair and a tight black T-shirt tucked into black pantslooks like the stunt double for Cop No. 3 on an early episode of “Miami Vice.”

These moonlighting copseach with a child’s education or wedding to pay forare as desperate for the money as the contestantswho are treated like inmates: the jail cellthe mug shotthe fingerprintingthe gross foodthe ceaseless questioning. This is doubtless a fun way to spend a weekendon par with touring Alcatraz at night or a border-crossing theme park in Mexico.
 1679,  2009, a, As The New York Times’s Zachery Kouwe wrote on FridayChrysler‘s bankruptcy is anything but ordinary. With the government serving as a major lender to the automaker and a prime mover in its negotiations with other creditorsthis case is politically charged from the beginning.

A rift with Wall Street has already emergedas a group of financial firms holding Chrysler’s secured debt has balked at the government’s debt restructuring proposalcalling it unfair and counter to the principles of bankruptcy law.

As the case was just getting under wayDavid Friedmanthe head of the bankruptcy group at the law firm KasowitzBensonTorres & Friedmansent DealBook some of his thoughts on the political aspects of this Chapter 11 case.

The Obama administration has talked about a quick and “surgical” bankruptcybur Mr. Friedman (who isn’t involved in the case) suggests that novel issues could complicate Chrysler’s reorganization — especially as relates to the Chrysler holdoutswhose role as secured lenders would ordinarily put them first on the list to be paid back.

Those firms pointed out Thursday that they have been represented in their talks with the Treasury Departmentby major banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Citigroupwhich have taken money under the government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program. For the holdoutsthat raised questions about how free the banks were to push back at the Treasury Department’s terms.

Some of these holdout creditors acquired their Chrysler debt on the secondary market for much less than full valuehowever. Critics of the holdouts say this raises questions about whether these creditors are simply speculators looking for a quick profit.

As the many players in Chrysler’s Chapter 11 went to court in New York on Friday for the first-day hearingwe thought Mr. Friedman’s comments made for interesting reading.

Mr. Friedman wrote:

We have issues here that have never really been implicated before. The holdouts are going to say that this is a noneconomic deal. They’ll take the position that if Chrysler were to liquidatethey’d get a premium to what they’ve been offered. Thatin itselfis a legitimate defense of the holdouts against the plan. The valuation fight over what creditors will get in liquidation is not unusual and happens all of the time. What’s unusual is the notion of banks being socialized. If you’re a minority creditoryou’d be saying that you’re being outvoted not on the merits but because a good number of the banks are under effective — though not absolute — control of the government. There are going to be some minority creditors who will take the position that the banks’ votes should not be counted as traditional creditors are considered in most bankruptcies. Nobody has ever touched this issue before. If the holdouts are being outvoted by people who are voting to achieve a social policy that is being forced upon them by the governmentthey might argue that they shouldn’t be bound by that outcome.

He went on to suggest that the Chrysler case could have long-term effects on creditors’ rights and the value of contracts:

 5352,  1988, a, The director of the $2.4 billion trust for victims of the Dalkon Shield birth control device made by the A.H. Robins Company yesterday announced the initial settlements that would be offered by the trust.

A trusteeKenneth R. Feinbergestimated that as many as 100,000 of the 195,000 claimants might take the initial settlement paymentwhich is not meant to compensate victims who received the most serious harm from the device.

Under the initial paymentwhich is being called Option 1women who were injured by the intrauterine device will be offered $725. Husbands whose wives were injured and children were born with birth defects will be offered $300. And women who are unsure as to whether the Dalkon Shield caused their injuries will be offered $125.

All claimants have the right to reject the Option 1 offers.

Mr. Feinberg said that the trust was setting up Option 2which would be a schedule for compensating more seriously injured users.

 435,  2016, a, Gov. John Kasich is no fan of Senator Ted Cruzbut he does not want his allies borrowing one of Donald J. Trump’s go-to insults.

Mr. Kasich on Friday called on a “super PAC” supporting him to take down an advertisement describing Mr. Cruz as “Lyin’ Ted,” a nickname for the Texas senator favored by Mr. Trump.

The commercialreleased by New Day for Americadepicts Mr. Cruz with a Pinocchio-like nose growing and wrapping around his neck.

Among other thingsit refers to an ad by a super PAC supporting Mr. Cruz that inaccurately asserted that the liberal billionaire George Soros had provided hundreds of thousands of dollars in support of Mr. Kasich.

“If Ted Cruz’s mouth is movinghe’s lying,” the ad concludes.

On the campaign trailMr. Kasich boasts about how he avoids personal attacks. Speaking to reporters in Pennsylvania on Fridayhe said he had expressed his displeasure with how Mr. Cruz was described in the ad. (Top Kasich aides used the same nickname“Lyin’ Ted,” in Twitter posts this weekwhich Mr. Kasich also found objectionable.)

“I would hope that they will not use that word and they’ll take it down,” Mr. Kasich said of the commercial.

At the same timeMr. Kasich displayed no affection for Mr. Cruz or his alliesbringing up a Wall Street Journal editorial that described the Soros ad as a “smear.”

“The problem with Senator Cruz is he has no record,” Mr. Kasich added. “His record is shutting down the government and making everybody he works with upset.”

Super PACswhich can accept unlimited donationsare not allowed to coordinate with candidates’ campaignsand this is not the first time Mr. Kasich or his team has criticized an ad from the super PAC supporting his run. Before the New Hampshire primarythe Kasich campaign called on the super PAC to pull an ad that went after Senator Marco Rubio of Florida; the group obliged.

Asked about Mr. Kasich’s commentsConnie Wehrkampa spokeswoman for the super PACresponded by expressing displeasure about the Soros commercial.

“We stand by our ad and the fact that what Ted Cruz’s PAC ran was completely false,” she said. “We will always call out our opponents if and when they do thatbut we are going to review the language we used.”

Re ''Who Built the H-Bomb? Debate Revives'' (April 24): In 1968 I asked Dr. Edward Teller to write a preface to the first edition of my Instrument Engineers' Handbooka totally unknown work then.

I asked him in particular because his participation would emphasize that this work was a Hungarian-America contribution to the progress of science. He agreed and spent a whole weekend in the library learning about automation and process control before he wrote an outstanding handbook preface.

This small episode shows that even before his heart attackhe was neither self-serving nor manipulativebut simply a generouscaring man.

 4666,  1992, a, Pro-democracy campaigners imprisoned in northeast China have smuggled out a letter in which they charge that they are are often beatenshocked with electric cattle prods and forced to work 12 or more hours a day making matchboxes.

The letterwhich was made public today by Asia Watcha division of Human Rights Watchaccuses prison officials of torturing some political prisoners so severely that they passed out. It also says the officials often call on common criminals to beat and humiliate the pro-democracy prisoners.

The best-known of the political prisoners reportedly subjected to this treatment is Liu Ganga 30-year-old physicist who has campaigned since the mid-1980's for a free press and multi-party democracy. Mr. Liu is now in the fourth year of a six-year sentence for "counter-revolutionary conspiracy to subvert the government."

It had been known that Mr. Liu and other political prisoners were being kept at the Lingyuan Prison complex in Liaoning Province in the northeast. But until now little has been known about their condition.

 2753,  2003, a, Alsosome state officials argue that gambling causes more problems than it solves.

''As a businessgaming has a tendency to absorb disposable incomeespecially from the poor,'' said Kumar P. Barvea Gaithersburg Democrat who is majority leader of the House of Delegates in Marylandwhere the House has voted to study Mr. Ehrlich's proposal for slot machines at tracks.

In New Hampshirea bill to create a video lottery is alive in the legislature but not likely to survive the veto of Gov. Craig Bensona first-term Republican who opposes gambling.

Other politicians have contented themselves with symbolic stands. Colorado just enacted a law that extends the hours and days of offtrack betting at greyhound tracksa change expected to raise a modest $1.4 million to restore a program for home nursing care.

Gov. Bill Owensa second-term Republicanlet it become law without his signatureto reflect his ''strong opposition to gambling,'' said his spokesmanDan Hopkins. But with a projected deficit of $869 million for 2004 and cuts that have curtailed many programsMr. Owens did not veto the measure.

Legalized gambling in the United States grew out of the Depressionwhen casinos went up in Nevada as a way to spur economic development. In 1963New Hampshire created the first state lottery. In 1988the Supreme Court gave Indians the right to run casinos. In 1991Iowa became the first Mississippi River state to license riverboat gambling. Nowcasinos operate in 27 states. Just HawaiiTennessee and Utah have no form of gamblingalthough Tennessee is contemplating a state lottery.

New proposals are proliferatingwith even cities getting into the act. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York has made clear that he has little enthusiasm for gamblingbut he also left the door open to slot machines as a way of helping the city's budget problems.

In Washingtonwhere the projected gap is $2.6 billionkeno has been a political Ping-Pong ball. Lawmakers from both parties are trying hard to kill a proposal to hold a drawing every four minutes to bring in $30 million or more over the first two years. After the Legislature failed to pass a budget by the April 27 deadlineforcing a special session starting May 12Gov. Gary Lockea Democratexpressed strong support for the measuregiving it a chance to survive.

 2143,  2007, a, Just over two weeks agothe Devils’ season appeared to be unraveling.

After losing at home to the Islanders1-0on Nov. 16the Devils were in the Atlantic Division basement with a 7-10-2 record. They had scored only 42 goals in their first 19 games — an average of 2.2 a game — and had lost three straight games as Martin Brodeur was attempting to notch his 500th career victory. (Listen as Marty discusses his milestone here.)

I had watched the Rangers defeat the Devils at the new arena in Newark on Nov. 14 in a way I had never seen — with patience and opportunistic scoringformerly a Devils trademark! With Scott Gomez and Brian Rafalski lost to free agencyand with Brodeur another year older and possibly a little slowerit was getting easy to believe that the Devils were a team in decline and looking at a season that was only going to get worse.

So what happened? After shutting out the Canadiens4-0Fridaythe Devils had won their sixth game in a row and were only four points out of first place in the division!

While six games does not make a seasonit is clear that this team cannot be counted out. Brodeur has been in net for all six gamesallowing only seven goals and recording two shutouts. Zach Parise (7 goals6 assists) and Brian Gionta (5 goals5 assists)along with Jamie Langenbrunner (9 assists) have given a huge lift to an offense that has scored 22 goals during the six-game streak.

Were you one of the ones ready to count out the Devils? Do you think they will continue to improve as the season goes on? Will they win another division title?

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Some puzzle constructors are attracted to a marquee phrase as their seed entry and some constructors can’t resist the Scrabbly allure of the rarer letters of the alphabet when selecting a place to start filling their themeless grids. TodayDavid Phillips shows us what it’s like to fall for the allure of the letter X.

Sureit’s attractive. And when it has a twinas in the clothing chain T.J. MAXX? Hard to say noisn’t itMr. Phillips? But is it a store that everyone knows? They are very popular in the northeastern United Statesbut I don’t know whether they are national or international. Research suggests that the chain has stores in several large citiesbut raise your hand if you live in a non-metro area and recognize it as a competitor to Kohl’s.

The entry that caught my eye was HATERS GONNA HATEa lively way to start off our solving year. I also liked SKIN TIGHT (which comes out of retirement after it’s last New York Times usage in 1953)POWER GRABALL SPICEAVALANCHETAKE A DIVERAISINETS (because yum) and LEFT TURN. I was not familiar with NESSES as a synonym for “promontories.”

Clue(s) of the Day for me are “Mass master?” for J.S. BACH and “Input signal?” for CARET (it’s funnier if you’re an editor)followed closely by “Roman leader?” for GRECO.

Let’s check in with Mr. Phillips:

Constructor’s Notes:

When constructing a themelessone thing I like to do is design my black square arrangement around an interesting entry. If done correctlyI feel this technique can help to squeeze in a few unusual lettersavoid the temptation of a prefab gridand perhaps even create a unique solve. For this puzzleT.J. MAXX was the entry of interest. Once I had placed black squares around T.J. MAXX (a few under the X’s and one above the J)the resulting NW and SE sections seemed to want to form stacks. Butplacing a black-square finger in columns 5 and 11 meant that what is now 27D would have been either a long entry starting with “J” bordering a stack (would this be fillableI pondered) or a stumpy 3-/4-letter entry starting with “J” (if I added another black square). Since I didn’t like either of those options and wanted to avoid stacked 11’s in the NE/SWI opted for 9 stacks all around (with extra 8’s in the NW/SE). LastlyI tried to place the remaining black squares in such a way to give solvers multiple opportunities to enter each corner. Of the entries in my original submissionWill and Joel liked the NE/SEbut disliked a buildup of proper nouns in the SW and the (non)phrase LEAVE LATE in the NW. After a little more back-and-forthwe settled on the fill you see. Stuff like NESSES and ANAS aren’t that greatbut they’re relatively isolated and don’t have too many bad crossingsIMO. As for cluesWill and Joel changed quite a few to bring this puzzle up to Saturday difficulty. [Auto racer Luyendyk] became [Part of “Die Fledermaus”][Widow’s peake.g.] became [Plugs can move it forward]and [Figures in red] became [Red menaces?]etc. Fortunately for my egoWill/Joel kept one of my favorite original clues — [Still the most?] for STEADIEST — and even felt that a question mark was warranted. At any rateI hope solvers appreciate the added “crunchiness” in their Saturday puzzle; make sure to thank your tireless editors! =) That’s it from me. I’ll have Ms. Swift lead you to the Sunday puzzle. Happy holidays and happy solving!

Ohright! That’s my cue!

 3969,  1996, a, A little-noted amendment to the farm bill approved by the Congress last week is causing an uproar among consumer groups and even some producers of meat and poultry. But the framers of the amendmentRepublican staff members of the House Agriculture Committeesay they cannot understand what all the furor is about.

The amendment creates a Safe Meat and Poultry Inspection Panelwith broad powers to review the decisions by the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service on such matters as inspection proceduresfood safety standards and practices in meat and poultry plants as well as work rules and labor relations.

Backers say the review panel would improve food safety by requiring more scientists to be involved in the decisions. Opponents say the panel's mandate will be too comprehensive. "We would grind to a halt," said Mike TaylorActing Under Secretary for Food Safety and Inspection Services. "An incredible array of almost all the decisions we make would be put through this committee."

The creation of the panel comes at a time when the Agriculture Department is about to replace the current system of visual inspections of meat and poultry with a more scientific approach that includes microbial testing and performance standards. While the industry does not agree with all provisions of the new systemcalled Hazard Analysis Critical Control Pointmost in the industry are eager for it to begin.
 4474,  1993, a, In a disagreement with New Jersey's management over the direction the team ought to takeHerb Brooks resigned as coach yesterday after fulfilling one season of the three-year contract he was given last June 5 to "take the Devils to the next level."

Brookswhose team (40-37-7) tied the Islanders for third place in the Patrick Division but was eliminated in five games by Pittsburgh in the first round of the playoffswanted the Devils toin effecttake a step backward before going forward. The 55-year-old coach viewed youth and speed as the main ingredients for building success. Management felt the players on the team were good enough to become Stanley Cup contenders.

In announcing Brooks's resignation yesterdayLou Lamoriellothe president and general manager of the Devilsmade it clear that Brooks "was not fired."

Lamoriello didn't appear to be upset that the man he had brought in to make the Devils one of the league's elite teams was no longer with the organization. But it was obvious he was upset about the way Brooks's resignation came to light. Accused of Loose Lip

 2105,  2007, a, This week’s Sunday shows appear to be dominated by talk of those whose careers have ended over the past weekas well as of some trying to get the ultimate political promotion.

This week was a pretty good one for Senator Charles E. Schumerchairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committeeand he’ll be on “This Week with George Stephanopoulos” to discuss it. The announcement by Senator John Warnera popular Virginia Republicanthat he will not seek re-election in 2008 gives the Democrats a better chance for a pickup in the Southern state that voted for a Democratic governor in 2005 and a Democratic senator in 2006. Mr. Schumer’s Republican counterpartSenator John Ensignwill also be therewhere he’s likely to be asked about Senator Larry Craigwho just announced his intent to resign. Fortunately for Mr. EnsignIdaho is likely to stay in Republican hands in 2008 despite the scandal.

Mike Huckabeethe former Arkansas governorwill also be on “This Week” to talk about his Republican presidential campaign. The other presidential candidate on television tomorrow will be Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr.a Delaware Democratwho is set to appear on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” as is Senator Lindsey Grahamthe South Carolina Republican. For even more presidential politicsNBC’s “Meet the Press” has a panel of all-star strategists: James CarvilleBob ShrumMary Matalin and Mike Murphy.



The other resignation that made big news this week was that of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. He was in a near-constant battle with Congress over a slew of issues including the firings of federal prosecutors and warrantless wiretapping. Senators Patrick Leahy and Arlen Specter of the Judiciary Committeetwo of the senators with whom Mr. Gonzales clashed the mostwill appear on “Fox News Sunday.” Ed Gillespiethe White House counselor and former G.O.P. chairmanwill be on hand to give the administration’s take.

Lanny Davisformer special counsel under President Bill Clintonand Ben Ginsbergformer counsel to the Republican Partyare also likely to touch on Mr. Gonzalesas well as the Craig arrest on CNN’s “Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer.” But much of the program will be devoted to Iraq and the upcoming progress reportwith guests including Senator Richard ShelbyRepresentatives Kendrick Meek and Charles BoustanyLaith Kubbaa former Iraqi government spokeswoman and The Times’s own Michael R. Gordonwho has a lengthy magazine piece out on Iraq.

 3038,  2002, a, GEORGE AND LAURA

Portrait of an

American Marriage.

By Christopher Andersen.

Illustrated. 307 pp. New York:

William Morrow. $25.95.

AT the close of George W. Bush's news conference after the Republican sweep of Congress last montha reporter asked what the president had given his wife for their 25th anniversaryNov. 5which the couple celebrated at the White House. Mr. Bushwho was by then out of camera rangeresponded with a lascivious winkprompting startled laughter from reporters who had no trouble figuring out what he meant.

Nothing so remotely risqué occurs in ''George and Laura,'' a largely respectful rehash of familiar tales. As cut and pasted by Christopher Andersenthe author of other tell-all political-couple booksthe story of the Bush marriage has neither fireworks nor glamour. What he depicts is an attraction of opposites based on love and commitment -- admirableto be surebut not especially interesting or revealing.

Andersenwho interviewed Mrs. Bush's mother but not the couple themselvespresses a well-worn theme: hard-drinking goofball living in famous father's shadow marries shy librarianwhose inner steel helps him beat back alcoholAnn Richards and Al Gore. Perhaps that is the theme because that is the truthbut Andersen takes no trouble to offer us new insights orin factmuch of anything new at all. Most of the information here has already been reported in newspapersmagazines and other biographieswhich would be acceptable if Andersen provided more than just a general list of sources for his chapters. He lifts quotations from other publicationswhich makes it seem as if he conducted the interviewsand confuses this readerat leastabout whether he himself dug up the few new nuggets he offers.

It was Mrs. BushAndersen assertswho first came up with the idea of Dick Cheney as Mr. Bush's running mate. ''So why not pick Dick?'' Andersen quotes her as blurting out in the summer of 2000when Cheney was in Texas overseeing the vice-presidential search. Since Andersen was presumably not sitting around the barbecue with themit would be good to know where this comes from. In another anecdotesourced to one of Laura's ''closest friends,'' Andersen has Mrs. Bush telling her husband late one night in the kitchen that he has to stop drinking or else -- and then writes that Mr. Bush ''rose slowlyambled over to the kitchen counter -- and poured himself another bourbon.'' LaterAndersen quotes an unnamed confidante of Mrs. Bush as saying that ''Laura was concerned that the stress of being president might start him to drinking again.''

 7423,  1964, a, “WHEN a man buys a horse,” said Mike Ryba“he takes mighty good care of him. The man knows he has an investment to protect and so he turns that horse over to trainergroomstablehands and exercise boys. But big league ball clubs are much too careless with their investments. They sink millions of dollars into bonus playerstheir stars of the futureand send them to the minors where one manthe managerhas to be everything to everybody.”

Mike is normally a placid individual but there was a faint trace of bitterness in his voice as he talked in St. Petersburg a week or so ago. He is nearing the end of a temporary scouting assignment with the St. Louis Cardinals and would love to latch on with some ball club in any capacity. He has matchless qualificationstoobecause of his remarkable versatility.

A slugging first baseman for St. Francis College of LorettoPa.he was signed by the Cards in 1925 as a catcher. He finished his big league career in 1946 when he pitched for the Red Sox in the World Series. He has played every position on the diamond and is the only man in history who ever pitched and caught in both major leagues.

“Last year I managed Cedar Rapids for the Reds,” said Mike. “But the minors keep shrinking. Bill DeWitt told me he liked my workbut he was forced to cut down. I had 35 kids out there and I could only suit up 19. So the other 16 had to sit in the stands during games. I would have the 16 at the ball park every morning for practice. When we went on the roadI'd leave the 16 in charge of the oldest.

 5154,  1989, a, Roberto Cossa's comedy ''La Nonna'' is sometimes darkand often its humor may be too robust for delicate sensibilities. But in the production by Repertorio Espanolthe Argentinian writer's play at the Gramercy Arts Theater is very funny; the laughter it brings from the audience is gleeful and utterly unashamed.

Mr. Cossa toys with some dangerous themes. How many playwrights would risk making a 100-year-old matriarch a comic monster? There are rough ethnic jokes; people fall victim to nothing more blameworthy than their own innocence; calamities are made ridiculous. The play is a formidable challenge to a director and cast.

In this caseseven regulars from the Repertorio Espanolunder the direction of Braulio Villarcreate characters whose absurdities ward off an audience's sympathy and keep the action moving so swiftly that there is no time for ethical reflection. And they do it without turning the characters into cartoon figures even though some of the pranks here put one in mind of the mayhem of Saturday morning television.

The story is simple enough: A family of Italian extraction in Buenos Aires is driven into poverty and desperation by its centenarian grandmotherwho is eating them out of house and home. Her language is a hilarious mixture of Italian and Spanishbut she is easy to comprehend; every word is about food and she does nothing but eat.
 2258,  2006, a, England and Portugal first met in the World Cup 40 years ago. Alastair Reid wrote about it a couple of months later in The New Yorker in his roundup of England ’66. It’s fascinating to read his account of the matchplayed when blanket TV coverage of sportscelebrity play-by-play commentators and instant replays (or action replaysas they were called in Britain) were all in their infancyBobby Charlton and Eusebio were in their primeand good feeling reigned on the soccer field.

England had never before appeared in a World Cup semifinalandalmost by sudden instinctthe wise men and soothsayers of football stopped predicting and started holding their breath. One columnist reported fancifully that a strangeflickering blue light hung over the whole countrya kind of television haloand certainly those who had grumbled the loudest about having to sacrifice some of their favorite television serials for the lavish coverage of the World Cup had by now stopped caring whether or not the serials ever came back. I had watched a fair proportion of the games on televisionand not only was the treatment technically beyond reproach but the strange tampering with the sequence of time that television is so easily able to indulge in had become almost part of our expectation. We had grown used not simply to seeing a goal scored but to seeing it over again almost immediatelythen possibly a third timein slow motionto say nothing of being able to watch it later the same eveningand even the following day. The B.B.C. and Independent Television sportscasters had grown into family friendsas familiar as mailmen. And yet nothing quite equalled the experience of the games themselveseven though the goals were over in a flashand did not immediately and mysteriously repeat themselves.



As I travelled out to Wembley on the Underground for the semifinalfaces seemed grimmer than usual. The touts on the way to the ground were hoarse by this timethe variety of ribboned rosettes had dwindledand I found myself waving aside programs and surveysfor I now knew all the names by heart and had grown as adept as any of the announcers at identifying the Portuguese. The scandal of the Argentine match was still very much in the airhoweverand we wanted above all some kind of restitution—some omen that might make the inconceivable possible. So farEngland had leaned heavily on its almost impenetrable defenseand on Gordon Banksits brilliant goalkeeperbut defensewe knewwould never win against a team as mercurial as the Portugueseand especially against an opportunist of Eusebio’s calibre. Wembley under the lights seemed as miraculous a setting as we could wish forand when the teams walked outthe national chant (a staccato sequence of claps followed by a cry of “Eng-land!,” which had first been borrowed from the Brazilians as a battle cry during the World Cup in Chile) had never been so urgentnever so hopeful. If England were to win against a team as dedicated and pure as the Portuguesethe combination of morale and “home advantage” Would obviously make it the favorite for the Cup.

The game itself proved to be the turning point of the whole competition. After the ugly incidentsthe squabblesand even the tedium of simply getting the games played outthe game with Portugal seemed a kind of unveilinga revelation of all that was best in footballa game that must have converted even chess addictsand that certainly won over clusters of people who had previously done little more than unwillingly suspend their disbelief. From the beginningboth teams seemed to have sworn solemn vows to demonstrate that the kind of fouling that had marred the quarterfinals had absolutely nothing to do with football at its best. The refereein factscarcely had to use his whistle at alland the spectacle of players helping their opponents up after a fall or patting one another’s backs in appreciation after a particularly brilliant piece of play sent the crowd into a roar. When Charlton scored for England after thirty minutesthe enthusiastic embraces of his teammates were punctuated with Portuguese handshakesand the shouts that came from the crowd were of appreciation rather than partisanship. More than thatwhat we saw was a transformed England teamplaying not the cannycoveringdefensive game of its earliereconomical wins but a swift and deadly attacking gamea game it might have learned overnight from the Portuguese; a fluentfastand diagrammatic footballwith longclean passes that seemed always to find their manthe kind of game that would turn the closest of goal-line saves into a sudden spurt of attack down one of the wings; a game that scarcely any of us felt we could look away from long enough to make even the briefest of jottings in our notebooks. My Portuguese neighbor might have been a dedicated English supporterso vociferously appreciative was he of the spectaclewhile wein our turntook only delight in the graceful subtleties of Eusebio and José Torres. Bobby Charlton scored again for England with only ten minutes left—a rocketing shot that took him well clear of the groundand did much the same for the crowd. Even thenPortugal seemed to be only beginning. England handled the ball in the penalty areaand from the consequent penalty kick Eusebio scored superbly for Portugalsending the goalkeeper diving one waywith a wriggle of his bodyand the ball the other. It was Eusebio’s eighth goal of the championshipand it set him up without question for the trophy awarded to the leading scorer. The end was trauma—England ahead two goals to oneand Antonio Simöes poised with the ballfatedwe feltto scoreuntil little Stiles materialized from nowhere and stole the ball andwe feltthe game. The final whistle had never seemed more of a reliefmore of a sibilantly emphatic piece of punctuation. All twenty-two players were as eager to thank their opponents as to embrace one anotherto trade shirtsto bask in the ovation of the moment. Eusebio wept as he left the fieldand it was only as we were trailing out of the stadiumstill dazed by footballthat it began to dawn on us that England was in the final.

The following daythe press forgot itself in lyrical ecstasies. The front pages all showed us Eusebio either in tears or embracing Bobby Charlton. The economic crisis had retreated to page 3and nobody seemed to have the time to see Mr. Wilson off to Washingtonor even to notice that he had goneso intent were we on the breathless possibilities ahead. Alf Ramsey pronounced the result England’s greatest victory since he had become managerand Tassthe Russian news agencyin an uncharacteristic burst of poetic fervordeclared“The World Cup semifinal between England and Portugal was like a spring of clear water breaking through the murky wave. It was beautifulcorrect football.” The Portuguese officials were no less generous in their praiseandhowever inglorious the Argentinian game seemed in retrospectthe bad taste it left had been more than obliterated.
 4966,  1990, a, If the American players can afford to continue playingthe team will be in its prime in 1994. More important than improving our teamhoweveris the need to educate the American public about soccer and the international importance of the World Cupto which we will be playing host in four years.

 1352,  2011, a, The New York Times Company said on Friday that it had sold more than half of its minority ownership in the Boston Red Sox and several other sports properties.

The company sold 390 of the 700 Class B units of the Fenway Sports Group that it owned to three separate buyers in a deal for $117 million. The companywhich did not disclose the buyersexpects to record a pretax gain of about $64 million in the third quarter because of the sale.

The sale leaves the company with 310 sharesor about a 7 percent stakein the Fenway Sports Group. It said it was also exploring selling those shares. Fenway owns the Red Sox; the Liverpool Football Club; about 80 percent of the New England Sports Networka regional cable sports network that televises the Red Sox and Boston Bruins hockey games; and 50 percent of Roush Fenway Racinga leading Nascar team.

About a year agothe company sold 50 shares to Henry F. McCancea venture capitalist.

In 2002the company paid $75 million for 17.75 percent ownership in Fenway. But in 2008faced with a deep recession and pressure to sell noncore assetsit began looking for someone to buy its stake as a way to generate cash.

The Times Company owns other interests throughout New Englandincluding The Boston GlobeThe Worcester Telegram & Gazette and Boston.com.

 304,  2017, a, The American Diabetes Associationby contrastreported receiving more than $28 million in industry funding in 2014or about 15 percent of its budgetbut provided detailed disclosures of which companies donatedand how muchthe study authors said.

In a statementthe hemophilia foundation said it never allows its corporate sponsors to influence its decision-makingand that it also does not endorse specific products or favor certain companies. It declined to provide precise dollar amounts of contributions from companiessaying that the foundation complied with “accepted financial reporting standards.”

The study’s authors said transparency could be improved by requiring the drug and device industries to report how much they donate to patient groupsmuch like they are already required to do with doctors.

That was applauded by other critics of the drug industry. “I think sunshine is an excellent disinfectant,” said David Mitchellthe founder of a new groupPatients for Affordable Drugsthat seeks to lower drug pricesand does not take funding from industry groups. He was not involved in the study.

Mr. Mitchell said patient groups often do not disclose that they take industry funds when they testify before Congress or government agenciesor when they disseminate educational information to patients.

Many have also been silent on the issue of rising drug priceseven as the issue has enraged patientswho have been increasingly exposed to the prices that pharmaceutical companies set as insurers have asked them to pay a greater share of their drug costs. Last summerpatients and their families loudly protested the skyrocketing price of EpiPensthough the movement gathered steam on social media rather than through traditional patient-advocacy groups.

And a year agofor examplea representative for the National Psoriasis Foundation did not disclose that her group receives at least 40 percent of its annual revenues from drug companies when she testified before the North Carolina state legislature on an unsuccessful measure supported by the pharmaceutical industry that would have limited insurers’ ability to block coverage of certain drugs. Similarlythe hemophilia foundation did not disclose its pharmaceutical ties when it took the industry’s side in 2015 in a letter to the Food and Drug Administration over the issue of biosimilarswhich are cheaper alternatives to complex biological drugs.

ARMY LIMITATION ADOPTED AT GENEVA; Three Proposals Regulating the Number of Soldiers Are Voted in Parley. TWO DEAL WITH CONSCRIPTS Each Country Must State Maximum Military Forces It Undertakes Not to Exceed.
 6217,  1975, a, JERUSALEMDec. 1 — In a special six‐hour sessionthe Israeli Cabinet decided today to boycott next month's debate on the Middle East in the United Nations Security Council and approved in principlethe establishment of new settlements on the occupied Golan Heights.

The unusual Monday Cabinet session was called in response to the Security Council action last night linking the renewal of the United Nations peace‐keeping force on the Golan Heights to a full‐scale debate on the Middle East with Palestinian participation.

Israel accepted the sixmonth renewal of the peacekeeping force today but denounced the Council's linking of the extension or the mandate with the Middle East debate,terming it a surrender to Syrian pressure.

In a long statement issued after the Cabinet meetingthe Government contended that the Security Council decision would sabotage peace efforts in the region. It also reaffirmed its determination not to negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization in any forum and stated that it would not cooperate in any way with the debate in the Security Council next month.

 1848,  2008, a, Updated8:30 p.m. | Berthaa sand tiger shark who had lived at the New York Aquarium since the 1960s and was believed to be one of the oldest sharks in any aquarium in the worlddied on Saturdaythe Wildlife Conservation Society announced on Tuesday. She was believed to be at least 43 years old.

“There was a lot of sadness,” said Hans Waltersa marine biologist who is the supervisor of sharks and the sea cliffs exhibit at the aquarium in Coney Island in southern Brooklyn. “It was a rough decision to have to lose this animal.”

Mr. Walters explained that as a last resortthe aquarium had euthanized Bertha. “She had been in declining health over the past month or so and we had started a series of treatments for her,” he said in a phone interview. “She seemed to rally a couple of weeks ago and was doing really wellbut at the end of this past weekshe showed another decline. We ended up restarting treatments again. When we realized they didn’t have any effectwe knew that it was time.”

The shark was put down around 4 p.m. on Saturday. A necropsy was performed on Sunday to determine the cause of the shark’s health problems; the results are pending.

Bertha lived with five other sand tiger sharkstwo nurse sharks and a white tip reef shark in a round90,000-gallon tank. She was about 8½ feet long and weighed just under 250 pounds. She had no offspring; breeding sharks in captivity is difficult.

[Note: As several readersincluding Lorne Loggiahave pointed outan earlier version of this article included incorrect figures — supplied by the aquarium — for the dimensions of the tank in which the sharkBerthalived. This post will be updated again when aquarium officials supply the correct dimensions.]

The shark arrived in Brooklyn no later than 1965 — after she was captured by commercial fishermen off the East Coast and turned over to the aquarium — but the precise date is uncertainMr. Walters said. “We have hard-copy records of all our animals,” he explained. “It’s an old aquarium. Things have gotten misplaced and lost and gotten wet.”

A written record suggests that Bertha had been bitten by other sharks in 1974. The bite marks are a sign of mating activityand sharks usually reach sexual maturity after age 6 or 7which would be consistent with Bertha having been born in 1965. HoweverMr. Walters saida retired employee of the aquarium believes that the shark actually arrived as early as 1963.

No matter which yearBertha was not only the largest of the aquarium’s dozen large sharksbut also one of the oldest sharks in any aquarium in the worldsaid Mr. Walterswho has worked with the sharks since 1992 and has conducted research on the care of sharks and on their migration patterns.

Surprisinglyit is hard to say how Bertha’s life span compared with that of other sharks from the same species. “Nobody knows,” Mr. Walters said. “You’d have to see it come out of the womb and follow as long as it lived. You’d be probably as surprised about how much is not known about sharks than about how much is known.”

The sand tiger shark is a largecoastal creature that dwells in subtropical and temperate regions. The sand tiger sharks are highly migratorytraveling as far south as the Carolinas and Florida during the cooler months. The shark eats small schooling fish and is not known to be aggressive toward humans (unlike the great whitethe basis of the book and movie “Jaws”).

Mario Draghithe president of the European Central Bankmay be pushing hard for a weaker euro to spur growth in Europebut his central bank peers seem to be several steps ahead of him.

In an interview with a German newspaper on FridayMr. Draghiknown for using his public comments to achieve policy goalssaid the threat of deflation might force his bank to take more aggressive stimulus measureswhich could include buying eurozone bonds in bulk.

His comments prompted the euro to fall to $1.20a four-and-a-half year low against the dollar. More importantit also highlighted a powerful new trend in world currency markets: Global central banks — along with investors also wary of the low returns that their euros have been delivering — have increasingly been switching into dollars and out of euros.

On Fridaythe dollar also hit a multiyear high against the Japanese yenand it was also gaining on the fragile currencies in BrazilTurkey and Russia.

The expectation is that a rapidly recovering United States economy will push the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates this yearmaking dollar-based assets more attractive than those denominated in eurosJapanese yen and emerging market currencies.

By contrastEurope’s economy remains stagnantand November’s inflation rate of 0.3 percent was a blunt reminder of how far Europe’s central bank is from meeting its inflation target of 2 percent.

To jump-start growth and avoid deflationmany analysts say the most powerful policy arrow in Mr. Draghi’s quiver is to talk the euro sharply downwardwhich would bolster exportsincrease the price of imports and ultimatelyit is hopedstimulate an increase in inflation.

“The euro is going to go down because it really needs to,” said Jens Nordvigthe global head of currency strategy at Nomura in New York. “The divergence between European and U.S. growth is veryvery wide now.”

Mr. Nordvig pointed to recent data from the International Monetary Fund showing that in the third quarter of 2014global central banks were big euro sellers and dollar buyers. As a resultthe proportion of global reserves held in dollars moved to 62 percent from 60 percentand the euro’s share fell to 22 percent from 24 percent.

In an $11 trillion marketmoves of this magnitude are highly unusualand they could signal a long-term preference on the part of central bankers for high-yielding dollars in favor of less lucrative euros.

“This was shocking to me,” Mr. Nordvig added. “And it really opens the way for a weaker euro.”

The weakness in the euro on Friday came after Mr. Draghiin an interview in Handelsblatt of Germanysaid“The risks of not fulfilling our mandate of price stability are in any case higher than they were six months ago.”

Investors interpreted Mr. Draghi’s comments to mean that the central bank was moving closer to broad-based purchases of government bondspossibly as soon as its next monetary policy meetingon Jan. 22.

“There are growing indications that the E.C.B. will decide as early as January to buy government bonds on a large scale,” Ralph Solveenan economist at Commerzbankwrote in a note to clients on Friday.

Yields on government bonds in the eurozone also declined on Friday as their prices rose. The yield on the two-year German government note fell to a new low of minus 0.11 percent. The yield has been below zero since September; investors are effectively willing to pay the German government to keep their money safe. The yield on the 10-year German note fell to 0.49 percentfrom 0.54 percent on Wednesday. The yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note fell to 2.11 percent from 2.17 percent on Wednesday.

The decline in the euro may have further to go. Many currency specialists expect the euro to weaken quickly to 1.18 or 1.17 against the dollar. But they caution that the time lag between a weaker currency and higher growth and inflation can be considerable.

Japan is a prime example in this regard. Since the middle of 2012the yen has lost a third of its value against the dollaryet the growth in Japanese exports has been disappointing and the economy remains stuck in a deflationary slump.

A strong dollar is a welcome reflection of a United States economy that is growing and adding jobs at a faster clip than many of its peers. But if the currency climbs too much too quicklycorporate profits can suffer. When the dollar is worth more against other currenciesit pushes up the price of American goods and services in overseas markets. This can lead to lower exports and weaker earnings for many American companies.

Douglas A. Kass of Seabreeze Partnersa hedge fundsaid the rising dollar was most likely a reason behind the decline in a measure of United States manufacturing activity that was released on Friday.

“We are starting to see the impact of a higher U.S. dollar on domestic manufacturing,” Mr. Kass said in an email. “This is one of the unintended consequences of a strengthening currency.”

And while United States economic growth is largely driven by domestic factorseconomists worry about the nation’s ability to expand over the long term when its major trading partners — EuropeJapan and China — are experiencing growth slowdowns of various sorts.

Stillcurrency specialists note that the dollar’s strong run started fairly recently and was preceded by more than a decade of persistent weakness. Measured against a basket of global currenciesthe dollar remains 20 percent below its high in 2002.

Moreoversome analysts say the currency effect on American corporations may well be muted — outweighedover timeby the positive effect of a recovering European economy drawing in more exports from the United States.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch calculates that a 10 percent increase in the dollar against the euro would shave a little under 2 percent off the earnings of major exporters within the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index in 2015.

“It is not just a cut-and-dried currency effect,” said Savita Subramanianan equity strategist with Merrill Lynch. “There is also the global growth picture.”

Mr. Draghi hasfor the better part of a year nowtried to make the case that to stave off deflation and low growthwholesale purchases of eurozone bonds must be considered.

Unlike central bankers in Japanthe United States and BritainMr. Draghi represents not just one country but the conflicting agendas of the 19 countries that use the euro. That includes the depression-hobbled Greece and the cash-rich Germanywhich remains perpetually wary of the central bank loading up on risky eurozone bonds.

And while many analysts now expect him to formalize this decision this monthit could well be that Mr. Draghi’s big bet for a European recovery is less the actual buying of the bonds in questionwhich will remain a politically draining exercise.

Insteadit could be a euro in free fall — driven by central banks moving into dollars and the foreign currency traders that follow in their wake — that does the job for him.

Among them are rapidly i?? creasing land values in and near the nation's citieszoom ing labor costs owing to large wage increases won by organized workers in the construction tradesinability of producers and developers to employ modern tech no??ogy effectivelyand op position by local authorities to method??hat would in crease the use of scarce land for housing.

Butin the words of the Secretary of Housing and Urban DevelopmentGeorge Romney“as important as all these factors arethe high co??t of home financing is pushing up the cost of hous ing as much or more than anything else.”

The cost of housingtaking everything into considera tionis rising by 8 to 10 per cent a year on the average.

“It isn't going to ??hangebecause basic economic for ces at work won't let it,” said Cornelius C. Rose Jr.chair man of North American Mortgage Investorsone of the new real estate invest ment trusts that have sought in the last couple of years to channel money from in vestors into housing.

“For one thing the reces sion this year has deferred a lot of demand for housing. The money that we've seen coming into the market lately will be sopped up in no time.”

Mr. Rose was one of the more than 4,000 mortgage bankerslenders and Govern ment officials who spent last week assessing the state of home finance across the country. Investment trusts such as his have already poured $1.6‐billion into con struction loans—most of it money that would not other wise have found its way into housing production. The trusts enable small investorswho cannot buy mortgages because of their high denom ??ationsto own shares in an entity that in turn provides mortgage money.

Life insurance companiesonce a vital source of resi dential mortgage moneyhave largely abandoned the field for two principal rea sons. Most insurance compa nies have suffered a cash outflow in the period of ris ing interest rates of the last few years as policy holders have exercised their right to borrow at 5 per cent and 5½ per cent interest on their policiesreinvesting the bor rowed funds at higher pre vailing interest rates.

 2004,  2007, a, Private equity is getting plenty of attention these days. Headlines routinely mention firms such as the Blackstone GroupKohlberg Kravis Robertsthe Texas Pacific Groupthe Carlyle Group and Providence Equity Partners as they recount the latest record-breaking buyout or takeover of a well-known company.

But Providence Equity’s chief executiveJonathan Nelsonsuggests that private equity’s new prominence has a downside: The rise of some widely accepted myths about the buyout business that could end up hurting the industry. “While many appreciate our role,” he told an audience of private equity professionals earlier this week at the Super Return conference in Frankfurt“more still do not understand what we do and how we do it. Name recognition is not the same as real understanding.”

So Mr. Nelson ticked off what he considered to be five myths about the private equity business and tried to dispel them. Belowthe myths and some excerpts from what he had to say about them:

* Private equity is private

At one timeprivate equity really was privatebut our business has changed over the years as capital markets and our strategies have evolved. There are now many windows into our world. Consider the following realities that you all know: Firstmany private equity investments soon return to the public arena in the form of an I.P.O. — and the P.E. firm often continues to own a large stake in a public company. Secondin many private equity investmentspublic bonds are issued as part of the acquisition financingand this debt comes with disclosure requirements. […] State pension funds and other L.P.s are increasingly disclosing positions and returns of the P.E. firms they invest with.

* Private equity firms are star-driven boutiques

The days when a star founder or group of founders did it all — raise moneyfind new investmentscourt sellersconduct due diligencenegotiate contractsclose deals and sit on all portfolio boards …. those days are long gone. My point is that people outside the businessand in the mediatend to focus on the prominent personalities in P.E. But with all due deference to some of my colleagues whoin factare stars — I think the brand names that will ultimately matter are the emerging institutional brands – such as BlackstoneK.K.R.T.P.G.Carlyle and Providence to name a few.

* Private equity firms are institutions

Whichever side you come down on in the “Star versus Institution” debatethe fact is we have not yet seen or lived through an era when the founders retire and P.E. firms endure. There are still very few examples of P.E. firms successfully transitioning from the founder to the next generation of leadership. While we’re all getting a little olderthis is largely a function of the relative youth of the private equity industry itself.

* Private equity is easy

[T]he model in our industry today is far different than the headlines would lead you to believe — and it’s far more sophisticated than it was 10 or even five years ago. In today’s environmentyou have to improve businessesnot just arbitrage public and private capital structures. Or said another wayyou must work on the income statement as well as the balance sheet.

* The private equity bubble is about to burst

There is an important difference between high cyclical valuations and tulip mania. We have the former and are not yet approaching the latter […] Since 2000the term “bubble” has been overused by punditsand it’s easy to latch on to that word today when we know we’re approaching a high point in the cycle. What’s misapplied here is the implication that we are headed for a free fall. I don’t expect thatbut I also don’t expect the laws of gravity to be repealed. We will correctmultiples will contract and credit will tighten.

 3558,  1999, a, The Diallo killingin which the officers stand charged with second-degree murderset off months of demonstrations in which the police were accused of trampling civil rights in their zeal to curb crime. Many critics said they were particularly upset by what they described as indiscriminate and routine searches in minority neighborhoods.

The most basic finding of Mr. Spitzer's study was that blacks were stopped six times more often than whites. Hispanics were stopped four times more oftenthe report said.

Blacksfor examplemade up 25 percent of the city population but 50 percent of the people stopped. Whitesby comparisonmade up 43 percent of the population but were stopped only 13 percent of the time.

Police officials have long contended that the disparity was based on the fact that most people are stopped in poorhigh-crime neighborhoodsmany of which have a majority of black and Hispanic residents. But the attorney general's analysis found thateven when the statistics were adjusted to take higher crime rates among minorities into accountthe number of blacks and Hispanics stopped still far exceeded the number of whites stopped.

Citywidethe study found thatafter adjusting for different crime rates among racial groupsHispanics were stopped 39 percent more often than whites. Blacks were stopped 23 percent more oftenthe study said.

To arrive at those percentagesthe analysts compared how often members of a particular race were stopped to how often they were arrested. The analysis found that blacks and Hispanics were stopped at a rate that was much higher than the rate at which they were arrested. The rate at which whites were stopped was only slightly higher than the rate at which they were arrested.

For examplethere were 1.5 stops of blacks for every black arrestedbut 1.2 stops of whites for every white arrested. Analysts calculated that blacks were stopped 23 percent more often than whites. In the category of violent crimeofficials said the disparity was even more stark. For examplethe study saidblacks were stopped as suspects in violent crimes twice as often as whiteseven after adjusting for the difference in arrest rates between the two races.

 3011,  2002, a, Upon arriving at their practice facility for media daySprewell told the Knicks that his right handwhich was visibly swollenwas bothering him. The Knicks immediately sent him for X-rayswhich revealed a fracture of the fifth metacarpal near the knuckle of the pinkie.

''He kept it to himself,'' a Knicks spokesman said. ''He didn't tell anybody because he didn't think it was a big deal.''

Sprewellwho will be replaced by Shandon Anderson in the lineupwould not comment todayand the Knicks refused to make him available to the news media.

Though Sprewell could have easily seen when he first noticed pain or swellingKnicks Coach Don Chaney said he was the type of player who could be injured and not realize it. Sprewell's agentBob Gistsaid that he spoke with Sprewell on Thursdayand that he did not mention the injury.

''You've got to understand who we're dealing with,'' Chaney said. ''We're dealing with a very tough playerprobably the toughest player on our teamso he's not going to complain about anything. We're always bumping and bruising ourselvesand when we have a little swelling herea little soreness therewe don't really complain that much about it. And he is the epitome of a guy who doesn't complain about injuries. He bangs himself all the timeso I would imaginewith him hitting himselfhe probably said'Wellit's just a bruiseno big deal.' ''

Though he has largely remade his image during his four seasons with the KnicksSprewell has been embroiled in more than his share of controversies with the club. Perpetually late for home gamesSprewell missed training camp in 1999 because of an unexcused absence. He was fined by the club last season for walking out of a mandatory team meeting at which the Madison Square Garden chairmanJames L. Dolanwas present. And he skipped a pregame shootaround and arrived just 80 minutes before tip-off for a game in Miami late last season. Sprewell was initially fined $125,000 -- one game's pay -- for that transgressionbut after he fought the penaltyDolan rescinded all but $2,500 of the fine.

The Knicksperhaps fed up with Sprewell's anticstried to trade him this past summershopping him in an attempt to land point guard Andre Millernow with the Los Angeles Clippers.
 4099,  1995, a, 6. Resolved: To be as cordial on our arrival at a restaurant as we expect the hostess or maitre d' to be in greeting us. Nothing can put a damper on an evening out faster than a dour greeting or non-greeting. At all too many placesthe official attitude is"Don't bother me. Can't you see I'm busy?" or "What do you want?" The official greeter should never be that busy. Nothing sets the tone for the meal better than a welcoming smile on arrival.

7. Resolved: If a dish is not as requested -- overcooked when ordered rareraw when ordered medium -- we have the right and the responsibility to send it back. Many diners are reluctant to do this for fear of making a scenebut it can be done quietlyin a friendlynon-imperious manner. After allas diners paying the bill we have the right to expect a dish to be as ordered.

8. Resolved: If a dish is described as consisting of goat cheesechorizo sausage and black beans and arrives without the sausagewe should ask the server where the missing sausage is. As dinerswe have the right to expect truth in menus.

If a key ingredient isn't available on a given day -- the sausagepistachiossun-dried tomatoes or whatever may be the impetus for ordering a particular dish -- the kitchen should inform staff members who should in turn relay this to the guest.

9. Resolved: If the food is disappointing because of kitchen inadequacieswe won't take out our displeasure on the server.

10. Resolved: To respond candidly when the server asks"How was everything?" All too often most of us make the pro forma response"Just fine," when in fact the soup was underseasonedthe entree was too saltythe dessert was completely different from its menu description. When askedwe resolve to try to give an honest answer in a tactful way.

All too often we simply do not return to a place that has disappointed us. By responding directly we provide helpful feedback to a caring chef or management. We can also judge a restaurant by how it responds to such candor: defensivelyindifferently or with real interest. A restaurateur serious about his or her work usually appreciates thoughtfulconstructive comments.

 2362,  2005, a, Gov. George E. Pataki made his first comments about Ms. Stubbs on Monday nightsaying he knew of "all that she does to help Libby with all of her political events that are very helpful," and was not aware of any impropriety.

"Libby has done a tremendous servicenot just in helping me politicallyand not just in so many of her governmental eventsbut also in what she has done to help candidatesto help our party -- the most recent one being all that she did to help and to attend events and to host events and to speak at the national convention -- and I'm proud of that," Mr. Pataki said at a brief news conference in Albany after speaking to the state's Conservative Party.

Mrs. Pataki wears a number of hats. As first ladyshe travels the state and speaks about issues like domestic violence. The governor's office arranges her travel for her official dutiesofficials said. Mrs. Pataki is also the top earner in the Pataki household: She reported earning more than $300,000 in 2003 in consulting feesincluding her work as a paid consultant to two charities. And over the last decade she has earned more than $650,000 as a consultant to Ronald S. Lauderthe cosmetics heir.

But party officials said that they had been moved to pay for an assistant to the first lady because of another role: as a builder of the Republican Party.

"Mrs. Pataki has been a great ambassador for the Republican Party," Stephen Minarikthe party's new chairmansaid in a statement.

 2517,  2004, a, In November 2001Mr. Feinberga Washington lawyerwas appointed by Mr. Ashcroft to be special master of the fundwhich Congress created in the days after the terrorist attacks as part of an airline bailout package. Families were asked to waive their right to sue the airlines and other entities. In exchangethey would receive a tax-free $250,000 payment for every deathand more money depending on a family's economic loss from that deathminus the deductions for benefits like life insurance and workers' compensation.

In many waysMr. Feinberg was both an odd choice and the natural choice for the job. Oddbecause of his political credentials as a former chief of staff for Senator Edward M. Kennedyand as someone who was considered for the position of White House counsel in the Clinton administration. A naturalbecause of his extensive experience in mediating complicated compensation disputesincluding those that arose over the Agent Orange defoliant used in the Vietnam War and the Dalkon Shield birth control device.

One month after his appointmentMr. Feinberg issued draft regulations outlining the mechanics of the fundrelying chiefly on Deborah E. Greenspana partner in his firmthe Feinberg Group; Phil Perrythen acting associate attorney general at the Department of Justice; Jay Lefkowitzwho was general counsel of the White House Office of Management and Budget; and John Wooddeputy associate attorney general at Justice at the time.

But after families and elected officials criticized the regulations as stingyMr. Feinberg and his core advisers made significant changes in the final regulationswhich were issued in March 2002to increase the payments. From that point onMr. Feinberg worked tirelessly to persuade families to apply to the fundconvening hundreds of meetings large and small all over the country (and in Britain)from the ballroom of the Marriott Marquis in Times Square to the basement of his Midtown offices.

In the endhe said that although he had expected many people to file at the last minutehe was surprised by the sheer volume of those filings. Equally tellinghe saidwas the fact that 40 people who had originally filed lawsuits against the airlines decided to file with the fund at the last minutereducing the number of lawsuits to 39.

That means that of the 2,976 eligible familiesat last count only about 50 had failed to file either a lawsuit or a claim.

The statisticsMr. Feinberg saidgive him a ''tremendous sense of personal satisfaction'' in validating the fund as ''a dramatic and stunning success.'' But because of the unique nature and emotional complexity of the Sept. 11 tragedyhe cautioned that the program should not be viewed as a template for future attacksand certainly not ''as an end run around the tort system.''

 2675,  2004, a, Because the personal retirement accounts are tied to the workersnot the employersworkers can take their accounts with them when they move to other jobskeeping the labor market flexible. The system does not penalize or subsidize immigrantswho receive what they have contributedeven if they return to their homelands. We set three basic policy rules for the transition to personal accounts: the government guaranteed retirees that their benefits would not be affected by the reform; everyone already in the work force could stay in the government system or move to the personal retirement account system (those who opted out were given a "recognition bond" calculated to reflect the money the worker had already accrued); and all new workers were required to enter the personal account system.

With this systemwe ended the illusion that both the employer and the worker contribute to retirement. As economists know wellall the contributions are ultimately paid by workerssince employers take into account all labor costs in making their hiring and salary decisions. To protect the net wages of workerswe initially recategorized the employer's contribution as an additional gross wage.

There was no "economic" transition costbecause there is no harm to the gross domestic product from this reform (on the contrarythere is a huge benefit). A completely different issue is how to confront the "cash flow" transition cost to the government of recognizingand ultimately eliminatingthe unfinanced Social Security liability. The implicit debt of the Chilean system in 1980 was about 80 percent of the G.D.P.

We used five "sources" to generate that cash flow: a) one-time long-term government bonds at market rates of interest so the cost was shared with future generations; b) a temporary residual payroll tax; c) privatization of state-owned companieswhich increased efficiencyprevented corruption and spread ownership; d) a budget surplus deliberately created before the reform (for many years afterwardwe were able to use the need to "finance the transition" as a powerful argument to contain increases in government spending); e) increased tax revenues that resulted from the higher economic growth fueled by the personal retirement account system.

Since the system started on May 11981the average real return on the personal accounts has been 10 percent a year. The pension funds have now accumulated resources equivalent to 70 percent of gross domestic producta pool of savings that has helped finance economic growth and spurred the development of liquid long-term domestic capital market. By increasing savings and improving the functioning of both the capital and labor marketsthe reform contributed to the doubling of the growth rate of the economy from 1985 to 1997 (from the historic 3 percent to 7.2 percent a year) until the slowdown caused by the government's erroneous response to the Asian crisis.

Personal accounts have become the "third rail" of Chilean politics and the system has been acceptedand even marginally improvedby the three center-left governments of the last 14 years. But it must be said that some labor market problems have increased unemployment and short-term labor contractsreducing participation in the system and making the future safety net more expensive to maintain.

When the system was inauguratedone-fourth of the eligible work force signed up in the first month. Today 95 percent of covered workers participate. For Chileanstheir retirement accounts represent real property rights. Indeedthe accountsnot risky government promisesare the primary sources of security for retirementand the typical Chilean worker's main asset is not his used car or even his small house (probably still mortgaged) but the capital in his retirement account.

 49,  2019, a, There are two very distinct sides to contemporary Southern apparel. Firstthere are labels like the movie star Reese Witherspoon’s clothing line Draper James (which isas its website tell us“steeped in Southern charm”). And then there are a handful of local labels inspired not by down-home hospitality but the region itself: hardscrabbleindefatigable and ever-changing. Just for startershere are three of the most exciting homegrown labels operating in the South today.

Club Duquette (BirminghamAla.)

Despite its current status as a peppy young cousin to New Orleans’s famed arcade of hipnessMagazine StreetBirmingham’s Woodlawn neighborhood wasn’t much of anything when Duquette Johnston and his wifeMorganmoved there 10 years ago.

“It was all we could afford,” either Mrs. Johnston or Mr. Johnston or both Johnstons say. The couple speaks in tandemoften cutting each other off to expand on the other’s idea. Both are excitable and irrepressible as they explain the evolution of Woodlawn over the decade since they moved therewhat it has become and what it is becoming.

After an 18-month battle with a postpartum illness that almost killed Mrs. Johnston34the couple decided to start their boutiqueClub Duquette. They opened shop in September 2016 with little more than a few of their own T-shirt designsa handful of pieces from the men’s wear label Taylor Stitch and some stock from designer friends. The store sold out in its first weekend.

 2308,  2006, a, So here’s the latestafter a day of piling on by Tony Snowthe White House press secretaryVice President Dick Cheneymany other Republicans and some Democrats.

Late this afternoonafter canceling an interview on CNN’s “Situation Room,” John Kerry issued a new statement:

As a combat veteranI want to make it clear to anyone in uniform and to their loved ones: my poorly stated joke at a rally was not aboutand never intended to refer to any troop. I sincerely regret that my words were misinterpreted to wrongly imply anything negative about those in uniformand I personally apologize to any service memberfamily memberor American who was offended.



It is clear the Republican Party would rather talk about anything but their failed security policy. I don’t want my verbal slip to be a diversion from the real issues. I will continue to fight for a change of course to provide real security for our countryand a winning strategy for our troops.

The question iswill that lay it to rest? For nowprobably. Of coursethis obviously will return to haunt Mr. Kerry if he tries to run again in 2008 for president.

The apologyafter Mr. Kerry insisted Tuesday that he would not apologizecame late in the dayafter Mr. Snow spent an inordinate amount of time at the daily briefing talking about how Mr. Kerry should apologizeno matter what he meantsaid he meantor said he intended to mean. We’re not going to do the back-and-forth from the Q. and A.; we’ll just send you to the transcript. (That’s not a slight of Mr. Snowbut the nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah between the press and the spokesman just dominated too much conversationon the day when the October death toll of American soldiers in Iraq went up to 105.)

Of coursewe do want to mention that between Mr. Snow and Mr. Cheney and Mr. Bushthey have had a talking point for more than a day over the original “botched joke” by Mr. Kerry. Here’s the text of Mr. Cheney’s remarksexcerpted again as advance text as though it were a summit speech rather than a stump speech for Senator Conrad Burns of Montana:

Instead they highlight people like John Kerrytheir presidential nominee in 2004. Aren’t we lucky he lost that election? You remember John Kerrythe senator who voted for the $87 billion before he voted against itthe guy that was always lecturing us about nuances. He’s the oneyou’ll recallwho last year said that American soldiers were terrorizing children in Iraq. And just this week he took another swipe at the U.S. military. Here’s what he saidword for word. Quote: You knoweducationif you make the most of ityou study hardyou do your homeworkand you make an effort to be smartyou can do well. If you don’tyou get stuck in Iraq. End quote. Wellapparently Senator Kerry’s the one who needs to be educated. Of coursenow Senator Kerry says he was just making a jokeand he botched it up. I guess we didn’t get the nuance. He was for the joke before he was against it. As a leading Democratic senatorJohn Kerry needs to learn that the men and women serving in Iraq aren’t there because they didn’t study hard or do their homework. The all-volunteer force represents the very best of this country. They’re smartpatrioticexceptionally well trainedand dedicated to their mission. They are heroesand they are the pride of the United States of America.

Or Mr. Bush on Rush Limbaugh’s show. Yepit’s like a tiger gnawing on red meat.

Anybody who is – who’s in a position to serve this country ought to understand the consequences of wordsand our troops deserve the full support – they – of – of – of people in government. They – people here may not agree with my decision. I understand that. But what I don’t understand is any diminution of their sacrifice. We’ve got incredible people in our militaryand they deserve full praise and full support of this government.

We’ll end on this note. Senator Hillary Rodham Clintonout campaigning for re-electioncalled Mr. Kerry’s initial remarks “inappropriate.”

More importantshe said that elections are about the futureand “we don’t have to be re-fighting the 2004 electionas much as President Bush would like that.”

Or anyone else.

Enough said.

 6135,  1977, a, TOKYONov. 30‐A new Cabinet task sorceworking to meet a seven‐day deadlinebegan to draw up an extensive plan today to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus as the dollar continued to climb against the yen and the stock market here rose again in heavy trading.

Reflecting growing signs here that the Government is determined to tackle in earnest the urgent task of reducing the nation's mounting trade surplus a major cause of the recent sharp upward surge of the yenthe dollar jumped to 246 yen soon after the opening of trading.

Japanese banks rushed to buy dollars for importers who apparently believed that the American currency was bottoming out. The dollar's rise to 260 yen in the morning session was the sharpest climb in recent months.

The dollar later eased a bit to close the day at 244.20 yen compared with yesterday's close of 241.90 yen. Turnover today totaled $503 millionup $150 million from the previous day's volume.

 1955,  2008, a, The Football ScientistKC Joynercontributes weekly to The Fifth Down. His latest book is “Blindsided: Why the Left Tackle is Overrated and Other Contrarian Football Thoughts.”

I often say that I review players with both a metric eye (meaning via statistical analysis) and a scouting eye (meaning via traditional tape analysis). At no position is this statement truer than at quarterback. With that thought in mindhere is my take on the question of which quarterback I would pick to guide my team for the next 10 years: Eli Manning or Tony Romo.

I’ll start with the metric overview. There are three main metrics I use for gauging quarterback play: yards per attempt (YPA)success percentage and bad decision percentage. I use these in place of the official passer rating system because that method tends to reward dink and dunk quarterbacks and punish gunslingers. In this series of measurements each type of quarterback will have his individual strengths and weaknesses displayedand as such I think it makes for a more detailedgranular form of analysis.

Yards Per Attempt

I use four route depth levels when tracking YPA. They are: short (1-10 yards)medium (11-19 yards)deep (20-29 yards) and bomb (30+ yards). Here are Manning and Romo’s 2008 totals through week 8:

Manning

Route Depth Att Comp Yds TD Int Pen Pen Yds YPA Short 139 100 823 4 1 3 18 5.9 Medium 48 24 411 2 1 4 20 8.3 Deep 19 8 217 1 1 1 5 11.1 Bomb 13 3 106 2 1 1 31 9.8 Other 10 1 31 0 0 0 0 3.1 Total 229 136 1588 9 4 9 74 7.0

Romo

Route Depth Att Comp Yds TD Int Pen Pen Yds YPA Short 132 98 923 6 1 2 9 7.0 Medium 35 19 374 4 3 0 0 10.7 Deep 14 4 108 1 1 1 -10 6.5 Bomb 10 5 264 3 0 0 0 26.4 Other 11 0 0 0 0 1 5 0.4 Total 202 126 1669 14 5 4 4 8.1

Romo has been better this year on short passes by just over a yard and he was better in 2007 by a similar amount. Romo also has a lead in two of the three vertical routes (i.e. mediumdeep and bomb) and his combined YPA on vertical passes is also much higher (10.3 to 8.6).

This doesn’t look like a one-year anomalyeitheras Romo’s 2007 vertical YPA was appreciably better than Manning’s (12.2 to 8.8)although to be fair some of the metric difference in 2007 probably had to do with Plaxico Burress’ injury. Even with that caveatI still have to give the overall YPA edge to Romo.

Success Percentage

Success percentage is determined by adding the number of completions and defensive passing penalties (i.e. any penalties that happen while the pass is in the airsuch as pass interferenceillegal contactetc.) and dividing that total by the total number of attempts. The total number of attempts includes both the defensive and offensive pass penalties (e.g. offensive pass interference). Other passes are balls that either don’t make it past the line of scrimmage (e.g. pass knocked down at line) or are throwaway tosses.

Here are Manning and Romo’s 2008 success percentage totals by route depth:

Manning

Route Depth Success % Short 74.1% Medium 56.3% Deep 47.4% Bomb 30.8% Other 10.0% Total 62.9%

Romo

Route Depth Success % Short 75.8% Medium 54.3% Deep 35.7% Bomb 50.0% Other 9.1% Total 64.4%

This is a very even contest. Manning is a bit better in medium passes and much better in deep onesbut Romo has a big edge in bomb throws and a slight edge in short ones. The overall split between these two in 2008 is negligible but in 2007 and 2006 Romo’s percentages were quite superior over Manning’s (64.5% to 57.1% in 200765.6% to 58.7% in 2006). Againa metric segment goes in favor of Romo.



Bad Decision Percentage



This metric gauges how often a quarterback makes a mistake with a pass that either leads to an interception or a near interception. These gaffes can range from staring at a receiver to not seeing a defender in a passing lanebut the common thread is that they are errors that generate turnover opportunities for the opponent.

The key to keep in mind in this metric is that small percentages make a huge difference. For examplea 2.0% bad decision rate means that a passer is messing up once in every fifty passes. A 3.0% rate in this category doesn’t look that much higher but it means a quarterback’s error rate is now up to once in every thirty-three passes. To express this in game termsthe 2.0% rate means the mistakes are coming about two times in every three games (or less if the team doesn’t throw often)while the 3.0% means they are probably coming once in every single contest.

So how do Romo and Manning fare in this category? Thus far in 2008they are about equal. Manning has a 2.5 % rate and Romo a 2.9% rate. That wasn’t the case in 2007howeveras Romo’s 4.0% bad decision clip ranked him 5th worst among qualifying quarterbacks. Manning wasn’t that much better but his 3.4% rate was lower. Their 2006 totals were about equal (1.9% for Romo1.8% for Manning)so that means that Manning gets the overall edge in this categoryalbeit by moderate margin.

Intangibles

This is where the scouting eye comes in. I look for a lot of things when scouting QBs but it really boils down to one question – does he make his team play better than their talent level says they should?

Take Philip Rivers. It is said that he possesses great intangibles and that those were a main reason his NC State teams went 34-17. The track record says something a bit different. To quote from Scientific Football 2006“Winning two out of every three games is a praiseworthy feat…but in this case there should be a big asterisk next to it. Fourteen of [Rivers’] thirty-four wins came against teams that either ended the season with three wins or less or were non-Division 1A opponents. Two more victories came against teams that ended the season with four wins. Add them up and it means that nearly one-half of Rivers’ collegiate wins came against poor competition. Orto put it another wayRivers was 18-17 against good teams.”

I point this out because Rivers and Manning came into the league at the same time and Rivers is always touted for his leadership while Manning has often been knocked for his lack of fire. I used to be one of the pundits who knocked Manningbut I stopped doing this once I saw that his teams were doing better and going further than Rivers’ more talented Chargers teams.

For instanceRivers led a team with a 12-14 win talent level to a 14-2 mark in 2006but then piloted them to a home divisional playoff game loss. The 2007 Chargers were nearly as loaded as their predecessors and he guided them to a wild-card berth. He won the opening playoff game that season against a limited Tennessee roster and technically got the win in the divisional roundbut he wasn’t on the field when San Diego’s offense made their comeback. The Bolts were quite banged up for the AFC championship and couldn’t overcome the Patriots. Put it all together and it means that Rivers has but the single wild-card playoff win that he can claim as his own. That’s a poor record when you have a physically superior teamas the Chargers were in those seasons.

Contrast that to Manning. The Giants have always had a very good rosterbut my personnel eye says they were not in San Diego’s league. New York also played in a division that was strong from top to bottomunlike the AFC West. In spite of thisManning has led his team to more playoff berths and more playoff wins than Rivers has. I don’t like to lean solely on the win criterionas it has its weaknesses (see Trent Dilfer and the 2000 Ravens)but in this case Manning has done a lot more with a less than Rivers hasso I’ve taken to giving him the edge in that matchup.

Now let’s look at Romo. The Cowboys have been the near equals (if not equals) to the Chargers in roster strength the past couple of seasons and yet Romo has not a single playoff win to show for it. He also lost a home divisional game to a Manning-led Giants squad last year. I can’t put all of that on Romobut lack of leadership is one of the reasons that team is losing the big gamesand some of that does fall at the feet of the quarterback. That means Manning gets a large edge in this department and it’s the reason I have to go with Manning as the better QB.

 2320,  2006, a, (A weekly look at favorable matchups)

Harrison’s Turn

In the long career of Colts wide receiver MARVIN HARRISONlast week’s one catch for eight yards was one of his worst performances. The rookie running back JOSEPH ADDAI stole off with four touchdowns. Bad games make Harrison mad. The last time he had back-to-back poor ames was last season in Weeks 2 and 3. Against a Titans defense that has allowed 19 passing touchdownsquarterback PEYTON MANNING is likely to look Harrison’s way and make him happy again.

Romo Familiar Foe

In a storybook year for Cowboys quarterback TONY ROMOthings will come full circle when he faces the Giants. Romo came on in relief of Drew Bledsoe in Week 7 and showed flashes of potential with 227 yards and 2 touchdowns in the second half. But no one could have expected his production since. Romoa first-year starter out of Eastern Illinoishas thrown 10 touchdown passes and two interceptions and has a 110.8 passer ratingthe best in the league and the fifth highest in league history if it holds up.

Need for Speed in St. Louis

When the mighty Rams offensive tackle ORLANDO PACE was

lost for the seasonhe seemed to take the team’s passing game

down with him. Since his injury three weeks agothe team once

known as the Greatest Show on Turf has had only 228 yards

passing in two games. But predating the injury was the fall in

production from the star wide receiver TORRY HOLTwho has

not broken 100 yards or scored in a game since a big performance in Week 6 against the Seahawks. That should all change when the Rams face the Cardinalsa team that gives up 230.1 passing yards a game and allowed Holt to get eight catches for 120 yards and a touch-

down in Week 3.

Point of Emphasis in Pittsburgh

Steelers tight end HEATH MILLERabovehas been a bit of a disap-

pointment this seasonwith 27 catches for 329 yards and 3

touchdowns. He had six touchdowns in 15 starts as a rookie.

With wide receiver HINES WARD out for today’s game against

the BuccaneersMiller should get more attention from quar-

terback BEN ROETHLISBERGER. Facing the 30th-ranked Bucs

passing defense won’t hurt.
 1447,  2010, a, 2010 began well for at least one member of the Paris Opera Ballet. At the end of the company’s New Year’s Eve performance of Rudolf Nureyev’s “Nutcracker,” the principal dancer Karl Paquette learned that he had been promoted to the exalted status of “étoile,” or star. The title is the only one at the Paris Opera Ballet that is not earned through the grueling annual competition. It is bestowed by the director of the OperaNicolas Joelat the request of the ballet company’s director Brigitte Lefèvreand it remains elusive for many. Mr. Paquette33who joined the company in 1994is both a sterling technician and an excellent partnerwith an ability to step in to roles at the last minute.

 669,  2015, a, St. Louis County Biased Against Black JuvenilesJustice Department Finds

A report says that the county’s Family Court denied fundamental due process rights to thousands of people and treated blacks far more harshly than whites.
 1997,  2007, a, Congressional travel arrangements and Democratic presidential candidates both old and new played large roles on the blogs today.

Al Gore was nominated for a Nobel Peace Price for his efforts in global climate changeefforts that also have him in position to possibly win an Academy Award for his documentary “An Inconvenient Truth.” And some blogs saw these potential awards as a possible prelude to a victory of a bigger kind.

The left-leaning Daily Kos considered the possibility of the world’s first Nobel Prize winningOscar holdingPresident of the United States.

“So say Gore scores an Oscar and Nobel in the same yearhe can announce in November and still become THE story in the primaries. It’s not as if he’ll need the full year to get his name recognition up or make the case for his candidacy … His passion is fighting global warmingnot Social Security solvency or extracting ourselves from Bush’s myriad messes. But if the stars align properlyyou never know.”

MyDD thought Gore might be taking too much time to leap into the presidential race.

The winner of the Nobel Prize “is traditionally announced in mid-October… then he can announce for President the following week? Seriouslyhow much time does Al Gore need to have for announcing a presidential campaign?”

The blogs also focused on Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delawarewho kicked off his run for the nomination yesterday with some widely criticized “compliments” for Senator Barack Obama of Illinois.

Patrick Ruffiniwriting on his self-titled blog(even though he’s been hired on by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s nascent 2008 campaigntook another angle on the comments from the charges of insensitivity and potential racism of yesterday.

Whythe site wonderedwould a politician be so effusive in praise of his competition,

“Exciting. Fresh. Smart. New. Insightful. Lightning in a jar. Six ways of saying the same thing. Excuse me Senatorbut if Barack Obama is all these thingswhy don’t you get out of the race and endorse him now?”

And Nancy Pelosiwho the conservative blogs covered with copious doomsday posts when she became Speaker of the Housefound herself under conservative criticism yet againthis time for her travel arrangements.

Responding to reports in the Washington Times that she is “pressing the Bush administration for routine access to military aircraft for domestic flights,” Suitably Flip said

“Nancy Pelosi is so bounteous with her new-found spoils that not only will she treat herself to military aircraft for all her travel needsbut so too shall her family membersher staff – heckeven fellow Congress members (so long as they hail from California) avail themselves of the on-demand military commuting service.”

Captain’s Quarters Blogwhile acknowledging that J. Dennis Hastert of Illinoisthe previous Speakersometimes used military transport for security reasonssaid that Ms. Pelosi’s “request goes far beyond even that questionable consideration … the military is not a charter service for politicians who want to avoid using the same airports as the rest of the hoi polloi. The military has other responsibilitiesespecially in a time of warand pampering Congressmen shouldn’t take precedence over them.”

 2542,  2004, a, In something of a microcosm of ABC's fortunes this television seasonthe comeback of ''Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' last week started strong in the ratings but faded as the competition stiffened.

The game shownow called ''Super Millionaire'' to reflect the $10 million jackpotstill performed better than almost everything else on ABC's schedule. It was the highest-rated program on the network each of the five nights it was on last weekalthough none of the shows matched Sunday's promising performancewhen it was the highest-rated show on any network.

The show averaged more than 13 million viewers a nighta strong showing that would place it about 21st among all shows this season. But its viewership among the 18-to-49-year-olds that ABC most cares about -- the group advertisers want to reach the most -- was more modest. ''Super Millionaire'' attracted about 5.3 million viewers in that age range(good for about 37th overall this season). Stillthe show was some good news for ABCwhich is mired in fourth place among the four major networks and a drag on the earnings of its parentthe Walt Disney Company. It improved on all the shows it replaced on ABC's regular schedule and on the ratings on the shows that preceded itas well as performing surprisingly well among younger men from 18 to 34. Last Thursdaythe network ordered another week's worth of the shows in May.

As the show's executive producerMichael Daviesput it''The ratings were solidnot spectacularsolid.'' But he added''I'm sure in their wildest dreams ABC wanted 'Millionaire' to be the show that could put the network on its back and carry it. It's not that.''

 3427,  1999, a, By all rightsthis should be the perfect time to be a woman in medicine.

The days of women toiling as a mostly unwelcome presence in the country's medical schools are long over: women now account for roughly 45 percent of all medical studentsup from about 25 percent in 1980.

And once they graduatethey are in high demand: many patientsespecially womennow request female doctors becauseamong other reasonsthey are perceived as spending more time with patients. Furtherwomen's health issues -- breast and ovarian cancer most prominently -- are front and center in medical research and political agendasfostering star-studded fund-raisersroad races and the like in every major city in the country.

But despite these gainsthe top tiers of medicine have remained inaccessible to many womenlargelyexperts saybecause they are unwilling or unable to find a balance between the years of study those specialties require and a life outside of medicine.

''Basicallythe picture is bad,'' said Dr. Wendy Chavkineditor of the Journal of the American Medical Women's Association. ''Women comprise very few dean and tenured faculty positionsand there are a lack of them in surgical specialties.'' The main reasonDr. Chavkin saidis that in medicine''there are still issues about career pathways that are the least bit off tracklike taking time off for child rearing.''
 6036,  1977, a, Mr. Carter said that the existing welfare structure was “worse than we thought.”

The “many separate programstaken togetherstill do not constitute a rationalcoherent system that is adequate and fair for all the poor,” he said. “They are still overly wastefulcapricious and subject to fraud. They violate many desirable and necessary principles.”

Mr. Carter said that he would send Congress specific welfare legislation the first week in August. Even if the measure can be enacted early next yearhe said“an additional three years will be required to implement the program.”

The President impliedhoweverthat it might be impossible for Congress to act next year. He said that energy legislation was his “first priority for Congress,” and other forthcoming proposalsincluding those that would revise the tax and Social Security lawswould have to he considered by the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committeesthe same panels that have jurisdiction over welfare measures and most of the energy package.

“I'll have to depend on Congressional leaders to decide in which order they will address these measures,” the President said. He said that the welfare bill to be proposed in August would meet the following 12 goals:

¶No higher initial cost than the present system.

¶Access to a job for at least one member of every family with children where there is a person able to work.

¶Incentives for those on welfare to take jobs in the private sector.

¶Public training and employment for those able to work who cannot find private jobs.

¶A higher income for families who work than for those who do not.

¶Incentives for families to stay together.

¶A continuation of tax credits to the working poor. (IA single cash payment to replace existing welfare programs.

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Have you ever traveled to a new town with no real plan for exploring and just meandered along the streetstaking in the sights as you go? I love doing thatbecause it’s the best way to stumble upon the hidden jewels that a town has to offer. That’s precisely how solving Sam Ezersky’s fine puzzle felt to me. I wandered around his gridlaughing and learning as I wentand that is the best possible outcome one can hope for on a Saturday.

We are a MOZZARELLA STICK-intensive householdso that’s where I got my toeholdand I counted myself lucky to gain entry into the puzzle at such an auspiciouscentral position. I crossed that almost immediately with TONY DANZA (how many boxers-turned-sitcom stars could there be?) and was off on my crossword adventure.

There was quite a bit of new stuff hereand even the entries that are not new felt freshor at least crunchy to me. I liked all the chatter in Mr. Ezersky’s grid: HOLD ON A SECAIN’T INO DOUBTOH I FORGOT and NERTS. I liked having to look up HUPMOBILE so that I could bring this interesting line of cars (back) to your attention. I appreciated the beginnings of a cocktail at 36 Down (SKYY VODKA) and the BRAIN GAME at 1 Down. For those of me who have trouble staying awake for “Saturday Night Live,” here’s a short article on the recurring sketch “Les Jeunes de Paris.”

Let’s take a stroll through the cluesshall we? For dark humorI liked “Notice after the expiration date?” for OBITand the Misdirection Award goes to “One doing 40+?” for FULL-TIMER. I could have lived without the abbreviated clue/entry pairing of “Size up?:Abbr.”/ENL.and I had a tough time getting from the vague “No wuss” to RAMBO at 12 Downbut there are always a few streets in our wanderings that we realize in hindsight it was better to avoid.

Let’s hear from Mr. Ezersky:

Constructor’s Notes:

From a constructor’s standpointit’s always interesting to look at a puzzle that you haven’t touched in seemingly forever. The one published today was constructed over two years agowhen I was in my novice stages of puzzlemaking … and as happy as I am with its acceptance and publicationI can see parts of the fill that I know I would have reworkedhad I constructed this puzzle more recently. For instancethe top-right doesn’t feel like my normal workwith ELUL / VALS / ENL right next to each otherand nothing in the stack of 9s really sparkling. But heyWill accepted thisso I must have done something right! The more fascinating part about looking at this puzzle now is noticing the development of clues over time. When I sent this puzzle inI had SKYY VODKA clued as [Liquor with the slogan “Passion for perfection”]. Wellnot only did another constructor debut this entry before me in a 2012 New York Times puzzle (grr!)but the slogan in the clue was updated to “West of Expected,” which I assume happened because the original one became outdated. Henceas time fliesclue tweaks become necessary! Enough with my lamenting and scrutiny. What did I like about this puzzle? WellI like MOZZARELLA STICKmy seed entry. I like BRAIN GAME (for which Will made a nice clue). And I like the way this puzzle “talks” to the solverwith “OHI FORGOT” and “SAYS ME” and “HOLD ON A SEC.” Coming up with LIVE RADAR while constructing helped me out of a real bind in the bottom-right. Pleased with all the clue saves Will made for crosswordese-y bits. Most of allI’m just grateful to be constructing for the Timesand I can promise many more puzzle in the future! Thank you alland enjoy! P.S.: If you’re interested in solving more of my workfeel free to check out my “indie” blogThe Grid Kid. New puzzle every Monday with some zippy stuff! [If you would like to check out some other terrific indie puzzle blogsI’ve listed as many as I could think of in the Blogroll to the right. — D.A.]

And look where we’ve ended up at the end of our stroll: The SAVOY Ballroomin New York City’s Harlem. Let’s swing on over to the Variety puzzle with this clip about the role The Savoy played in integration through music and dance.

 3632,  1998, a, Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern and other Parks Department officials declined to comment. An official who spoke only on the condition that neither he nor his agency be identified said''Calling it a park site conveys a sense of permanence.''

The housing agency began its campaign to redevelop the garden sites in late 1996 by evicting gardeners from 50 of them and beginning development plans. Construction has started on a few sitesand design has been done on others.

At about the same timethe department announced that all gardens under its jurisdiction would be open for development or sale. Nowits inventory of garden sites has more than doubledthough they still represent just a small fraction of the 11,000 city-owned vacant lots.

Frank Braconiexecutive director of Citizens Housing and Policy Councila research group sponsored by the real estate industrysaid the danger is that temporary useseven if clearly defined in advancecan be very hard to end. ''If I were the city and knew that temporary uses all become entrenched in stoneI would never allow temporary uses,'' he said.

He suggested that the new policyhowever reasonablecould mean an uglier city. ''We could end up with a lot of empty lots with cyclone fences around them,'' he said.

That is exactly the vision being suggested by a coalition of nine environmental groups called New York City Greenwhich said it was studying possible legal actions. Some advocates have urged that all the gardens be preservedthough others have said they would be satisfied with clear criteria for deciding which gardens should be preserved and which should be housing sites.

''This is nothing but a land grab,'' said Steven Frillmannexecutive director of the Green Guerrillasan environmental group that built its first community garden in 1973 on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. ''But we don't suffer from tunnel vision,'' he said. ''We're not saying we have to hold on to every garden.''
 2412,  2005, a, Adam Fisher remembers walking home from elementary school thinking not about Mister Softee or Ms. Pac Man but about Ms. Gracehis third-grade teacher. Whyhe wonderedhad she explained a new math concept in such a roundabout way? If only she had laid it out like thishe recalls thinkingreworking the lesson in his headthen we would have understood it immediately.

This was not the first time Mr. Fisher had pondered the art of teaching and learning. In facthe had been tutoring his classmates since the previous yearhaving discovered that he had a knack for explaining concepts so the other kids understood them.

A slender fellow with a goatee and a mass of curly hairMr. Fisher34still tutors students. Only today his students are seeking higher test scores -- and his tutorials cost $375 to $425 an hour.

Mr. Fisher is among about 100 tutors working for Advantage Testing Inc.an Upper East Side test preparation firm. He joined nine years agowith no formal teaching experience but a master's degree in music from Juilliard and a Harvard physics degreeand is now one of the firm's most senior tutors. He says he consistently raises SAT scores by more than 200 points and achieves similar results in graduate school exams.
 2919,  2002, a, To the Editor:

Citing the First AmendmentStephen Gillers opposes a Minnesota rule that bars judicial candidates from announcing their views on issues likely to come before them if elected (''Let Judicial Candidates Speak,'' Op-EdMarch 28). But there are values of equal constitutional importance on the other side of this controversy: the right to fair and impartial courts.

Already that right is jeopardized by the increasing role of money in judicial elections. The public wants judges who dispense impartial justicebut three-quarters of voters now believe that campaign contributions are influencing judicial decisions.

Without safeguards like the one in Minnesotajudicial candidates will feel more pressure to speak to the special interests that pay for campaigns.

 4156,  1995, a, Just before midnight yesterdayhousing police officers in the Melrose section of the Bronx fastened a plastic plate high on the wall behind the station desk bearing the shield of the New York City Police Department. For the officers therethe act symbolized a merger that would forever change the structure of law enforcement in New York City.

The consolidation of New York City's three police departmentssomething sought unsuccessfully by two Mayors and for years the focus of intense debatebecame final yesterday with the incorporation of the housing police into the New York City Police Department. The merger followed by about a month the incorporation of the transit police into the larger city force.

In some neighborhoodshousing officers wore black bands on their shields. "We're mourning the death of housing," one said. But while city officials said the merger would actually increase the police presence in the projectsit would have little immediate impactexcept for new patches on the officers' uniformsand some bureaucratic changeslike different overtime forms.

Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani commemorated the merger by visiting officers in what was until yesterday a housing police service area in the Bronxthe equivalent of a police precinct. He sought to assure them that they would be valued members of a larger police force that would now number more than 38,000 people.

 1893,  2008, a, So who won the Subway Series this year?

As the Mets spokesmanJay Horwitzsaid in a statement“We won four of six games from the Yankees.”

And over the weekendthe Mets and the Yankees won two games apiece — “a split” in the words of our Mets reporterBen Shpigel.

So how is it that the Empire State Building officials declared the Yankees victoriousilluminating the landmark icon in the Yankees’ blue and white team colors on Monday night? A news release on Monday declared“Empire State Building Shines For Yankees’ Win!”

This sparked confusion. An e-mail message was sent to City Roomwritten by a curious reader: “I just looked out my office window and noticed the Empire State Building shining a bright blue and white. How can this be when the Yankees lost the Subway Series4 games to 2?”



Other Met fans expressed indignation.

It’s enough to validate the recent sentiment espoused by Jerry Manuelthe Mets’ managerwho said that his squad is “kind of the second team.”

But the light slightapparentlycomes down to how one defines “series.”

As has been noted on this blog beforethe Empire State Buildingoutfitted with high-tech lightshas done a Solomonic splitting-the-baby approach during this year’s two Subway Series weekendssplitting the four sides of the building into both teams’ colors: blue and white (Yankees) on the north and south sidesand blue and orange (Mets) for the east and west. The victor of each three-game series knocks out the other team’s colors for that weekend.

So what happened? Wellthe Mets won two of the three games at Yankee Stadium in Maybut the third — the May 16 game — was rained out and rescheduled for this past Fridayjust before the first of the already scheduled three-game series at Shea Stadium — it resulted in a day-night doubleheader in two stadiums.

The Yankees then proceeded to win the scheduled three-game series at Shea Stadium2 games to 1.

“Each yearthe Empire State Building celebrates the friendly New York rivalry of the Mets-Yankees subway series by splitting its tower lights for both teams’ colorswith the winning team of each weekend’s games claiming the entire crown of the world’s most famous office building,” said James Connorsthe general manager at the Empire State Building.

Mr. Connors went on to say:

We’re bipartisan here at the Empire State Building and love both of our home teams equally. Because the Yankees won two of the three scheduled games for this past weekend’s Subway Series at Sheathe building was lighted in Yankees blue-and-white on Monday night. As you may rememberthe Mets won the Subway Series weekend last Mayso the building was lighted in Mets blue and orange as a result. Thusboth teams are 1-1 for the overall 2008 Subway Series seasonjust like the results from last year. We’re glad to see New York City’s baseball fans getting into the fun spirit of the Subway Series games with hopes of team-color bragging rights lit up on the Empire State Building.

Nexta call was made to the Elias Sports Bureauthe official baseball statistics keeperand this is where things get murky.

“The thing is that there is no real definition of series,” said Ken Hirdta researcher who answered the phone. “A ‘doubleheader’ is a defined term in the rulebook and ‘series’ is not one of those terms.”

“Usually we define a series as change of venue or opponent,” he said. Note: change of venuenot change of city. And what happened on Friday was that the two teams changed sites between their two games. The Mets won in the afternoon15-6at Yankee Stadiumbefore the Yankees won at night9-0at Shea. (So much for home-team advantage.)

“There were two games in one day in the same city with the same teams — I can see why it could be considered one series,” Mr. Hirdt said. “This weekend shows where there is some gray area in the definition of a series.”

There have been Subway Series since 1997when Major League Baseball introduced interleague play. After starting with just three games apiece in 1997 and 1998the league moved to six games (two series of three gamesone at each stadium) in 1999 because of the popularity of Yankees vs. Mets. For the last three years (2005 through 2007)2002 and 1999the teams split the six games. In 2004the Mets won4 games to 2. In 2001 and 2002the Yankees won4 games to 2.

In 2003the Yankees won all six games. “That was a bad year for the Mets,” Mr. Hirdt noted.

(Of coursein the Subway Series that mattered most — the 2000 World Series that pitted the teams against each other — the Yankees beat the Mets4 games to 1.)

If it is any consolation to the Met fans (as Mr. Connors pointed out)since their team had won the two of three scheduled games in May of this year (with one unplayed)the Mets got the Empire State Building lights all to themselves.
 5376,  1987, a, While Dr. Edelson was focusing on immunologyJohn A. Parrishthen a young dermatologist at Massachusetts General Hospitalwas exploring what seemed to be a different puzzlethe role of photobiology in treating skin disease. But Dr. Edelson's cancer experiment arose from the drug-and-light-based therapy that Dr. Parrish and his team had developed for severe psoriasis.

Dr. Parrishnow director of the Wellman Laboratories of Photomedicine at Massachusetts Generalhad been experimenting with a centuries-old treatment for vitiligoa fairly common disease caused by the absence of pigment cells in certain parts of the skin which results in a checkerboard appearance. Ancient Egyptians had extracted a chemical8-methoxypsoralenfrom limesfigs and various plants and used it in combination with sunlight to treat the disease. The interplay of drug and light caused a deepuniform tan that hid the patches of colorless skin. Dr. Parrish administered the drug in pill form and activated it with artificial ultraviolet lightwhich was more controllable than sunlight.

When he discovered that the photoactivated drug could inhibit cell growthDr. Parrish shifted his attention to severe psoriasisa nonlethal but disfiguring scaling-skin diseasewhichlike cancerinvolves the abnormal and disorderly growth of cells. His work led to PUVA - psoralen plus ultraviolet type A - which revolutionized the treatment of psoriasis. With PUVADr. Parrish and his team added a new word to the medical lexicon: photochemotherapy - light plus drug plus treatment.

Dr. Edelson's epiphany came one day in 1976whenas an assistant professor of dermatology at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeonshe was explaining how PUVA works to a psoriasis patient about to undergo the treatment at Columbia-Presbyterian: You ingest a dose of psoralen and wait a few hours for the drug to be absorbed. Then you stand in a chamber lined with tubes emitting ultraviolet light. The light activates the drugwhich in turn halts the abnormal growth of skin cells.

It occurred to Dr. Edelson then that ultraviolet light might also be able to affect the diseased white cells characteristic of C.T.C.L. in its advanced stages. If suitable materials could be found through which ultraviolet light might passthe whole procedure could be done safely outside of the body.

DR. EDELSON EXPERIMENTED with culture dishes used in the lab and found that certain plastics permitted ultraviolet light to penetrate their surface. ''In my mind,'' Dr. Edelson recalls''the question then became'Is this concept too cute to work?' ''

There washowevera practical basis for his idea. Investigators at Massachusetts General had proven that PUVA can affect the life span of lymphocytes. Dr. Edelson was already working with a process involving the removal of T-cells. But he needed a way to deliver the light to the patient's psoralen-bathed blood cells and then get the damaged cells back into the body so that the spleena major repository for T-cellscould jump-start the flagging immune system.

 3635,  1998, a, 'Didn't Do It for Love'

Directed by Monika Treut

Not rated; 82 minutes

One thing you can say about Eva Norvindthe flamboyant subject of Monika Treut's documentary film ''Didn't Do It for Love,'' is that she has never stayed in one mode for very long. When she was still a teen-ager in the early 1960'sthe Norwegian-born actress took a bus from New York to Mexico with only $10 in her pocket. She quickly established herself as a blondbuxom star in a series of Mexican B-movies and worked as a prostitute whose clients included a number of prominent Mexican politicians. Later she participated in a scheme to smuggle television sets into the country.

After appearing on Mexican television advising women about birth control and creating a scandal by exhibiting herself on the streets in a bikiniMs. Norvind was officially deported from the country (but remained secretly)and had an illegitimate daughter.

Moving to New York City after winning a scholarship to study film at New York UniversityMs. Norvind established a raffish literary salon of sorts and under the name Ava Taurel became a professional dominatrix administering punishment and humilation to a mostly male clientele (many of her clients were lawyersshe recalls) at $300 an hour. As business boomedshe began teaching workshops in dominance and submission and appeared on television talk shows.

All this frenetic change is more than one modest 80-minute movie can comfortably encapsulate. The person shown in the film clips of Ms. Norvind when she was a Mexican movie star bears hardly any physical resemblance to the severe gray- haired woman of todaywho in the movie's black-and-white film clips of her practicing her sadomasochistic trade fits the 1940's movie stereotype of a menacing prison matron.

 1850,  2008, a, The New York Post reported today that Gov. David A. Paterson has asked the state attorney generalAndrew M. Cuomoto investigate reports that the State Police had improperly collected information on public officials for political ends. Mr. Cuomoconfirming the report in The Postissued the following statement this afternoon:

I am in receipt of a letter from Governor Paterson requesting that I conduct an investigation of the State Police. I accept the governor’s direction. I applaud Governor Paterson for his leadership and commitment to integrity in government and in the State Police specifically. Combining politics and police work is a toxic brew. Any questions about political interference within the State Police are a serious concern. Our investigation will determine whether or not this has occurred within the State Policeand if so to what extent. We will be purposeful and thorough in undertaking this inquiry. I will assemble a team dedicated to this effort and will update the governor on our progress periodically. We will follow the facts wherever they lead and we will get to the truth of the matter. Public integrity has been a priority of my office and we will continue our efforts to restore New Yorkers’ trust in their government.

The Post reported that Governor Paterson took the action after consulting with Joseph L. Brunothe State Senate majority leaderand Sheldon Silverthe Assembly speaker.

Mr. Bruno applauded the decisionsaying in a statement today:

 5237,  1988, a, But he also said that the mere presence of asbestos in a building did not mean its occupants were in danger. The degree of danger depends on whether the asbestos is crumbling and sending fibers into the airand whether the material is in parts of the building where people are exposed.

He said that maintenance workers in boiler rooms or those who repair the buildings were at the highest risk.

The agency has not done a survey of asbestos contamination of private homes. It has found that at least 35,000 school buildings contain asbestos in potentially dangerous form.

Acting under a Congressional mandatethe E.P.A. last year issued rules requiring all schools to be inspected for asbestos dangers. Where such dangers are foundaction must be taken to reduce or remove the danger by steps ranging from removal of the asbestos to sealing it off. Improving Technical Capability

Although the report did not recommend a similar program for putlic and commercial buildingsthe agency did not rule out the possibility of a mandatory inspection and asbestos control program in the future. The recommendations to Congress in the report were limited to improving the nation's technical capability for dealing with asbestos by training more professionalsenforcing existing regulations for protecting schoolchildren and workers and trying to ''objectively assess'' how the program for cleaning up asbestos in schools is working.

John F. Welchpresident of the Safe Buildings Alliancean association of companies that formerly made asbestos building materialscriticized the report for what he said was ''an absence of concrete recommendations and guidelines for building owners.''

Mr. Welch also said he was unhappy that the agency did not give more publicity to a another E.P.A. survey of asbestos in 43 buildings owned by the Federal Government which showed thaton averagethey contained no more asbestos fibers in the air than in the outside air of their area.

 3411,  1999, a, It is usually Variety magazinethe hometown publication of Hollywoodwhere a reader can find the headline ''For Your Consideration'' above film-studio advertisements promoting a particular movie or actor. The audience for the ads tends to be voters who nominate and select the winners of the Academy Awards.

But the ''For Your Consideration'' form was transported to a different stage on Thursdayas The Wall Street Journal ran a full-page ad in The Washington Postthe hometown publication of national politics. At first blushthe message seemed to be: We Told You So.

Under the headline ''Who Is Bill Clinton?'' the ad -- a reprint of The Journal's editorial page Thursday -- excerpted seven years' worth of editorials about the President.

Two passages are favorites on Liberty Streetwhere the Manhattan-based Journal is published. Onewhich first ran on Jan. 181994reads''A special prosecutor will have irreconcilable mandates; if he sticks too strictly to the law the public will remain unsatisfied and skeptical; but if he exposes everything of legitimate public concernhe will look abusive by normal prosecutorial standards.''

His penchant for flamboyance -- he regularly landed in town on his private Boeing 737 -- played skillfully to an Argentine weakness for gaudy displays of money and fast living and a wistful fascination with political power.

The final score of the matchwhich began on Oct. 8 in Manhattanwas 12 1/2-11 1/2. Kasparov27 years oldhad already clinched a tie and retained his title last week. In a tiethe $3 million prize money would have been splitalthough Kasparov would have kept the world title he won from Karpov in 1985. But by winningKasparov won $1.7 million and a diamond-studded trophy. Karpov39won $1.3 million.

Although Karpov will have to win the right to challenge Kasparov again in 1993they are clearly the world's best and second-best players. In 144 games that the Soviet grandmasters have played in five world title matchesKasparov is ahead by only 2.

After losing the previous gamethe champion played as conservatively as he knew how. He shifted from the belligerent 1 e4 openings that he had used throughout this series to the more solid English Opening. Karpov did his best to try to create complicationsbut that was difficult when his opponentas Whitemoved first. In the final positionwhich was heavily in Kasparov's favorthe champion offered a draw and Karpov had little choice but to accept. QuietPositional Opening
 651,  2015, a, In 2008the Justice Department blocked Yahoo from making a deal with Google to provide the search ads for Yahoo’s web search efforts.

NowYahoo and Google are exploring a new relationship in which Yahoo would use Google for some regular search results as well as search ads.

Yahoo confirmed on Wednesday that it has begun testing the use of Google search ads for a small portion of its desktop and mobile web search results. “As we work to create the absolute best experiences for Yahoo usersfrom time to timewe run small tests with a variety of partners including search providers,” the company said in a statement. “There is nothing further to share at this time.”

Google also confirmed the arrangement.

The tests were first uncovered by Aaron Wallfounder of SEO Booka site that helps companies improve their rankings in web searches.

Yahoo got the right to work with other search providers in Aprilwhen it renegotiated its partnership with Microsoftwhose Bing search service had been the exclusive provider of search results and ads to Yahoo under a 10-year partnership between the companies. Under the revised dealYahoo can use its own search technology or that of other providers for up to 49 percent of its search results.

Marissa MayerYahoo’s chief executiveoversaw search products at Google earlier in her career. Howeveruntil nowshe has signaled that she was focused on developing new search products at Yahoo rather than turning to her old employer for help. She has also been aggressive at getting Yahoo’s search engine bundled into third-party productslike Mozilla’s Firefox web browser and Oracle’s Java software.

Any broad search deal between Yahoo and Google is likely to come under antitrust scrutiny. Google already handles most web searches worldwideand the European Commission has a formal antitrust case pending against italleging it has abused its dominant position.

 2038,  2007, a, Just a short while agoPresident Bush made good on his promiseand vetoed the war spending bill that included a timeline for troop withdrawal passed by the Democratic-controlled Congress last month. He made his action public in a short announcementsaying the Democrats had approved a plan that set a “rigid and artificial” deadline that “would impose impossible conditions for our commanders and troops in combat.”

“I recognize that many Democrats saw this bill as an opportunity to make a political statement about their opposition to the war,” he said. “They sent their message,” but nowhe warnedCongress should begin working on a new bill so that troops can get necessary funds. A meeting with Congressional leaders from both parties is scheduled for tomorrow at the White House. Benchmarks for the Iraqi government appear to be a likely starting point for negotiations.

“The need to act is urgent,” he said.

Mr. Bush also defended his troop buildupsaying that sectarian murders in Iraq have decreased “substantially” since January. He added that the suicide attacks still occurring are “largely the work of Al Qaedathe enemy that everyone agrees we should be fighting.”

Though Mr. Bush did not address the anniversary of his “mission accomplished” speechwar opponents have made much of the fact that the veto comes exactly four years after Mr. Bush announced that major combat operations in Iraq had ended with a banner that read “Mission Accomplished” behind him.

Referring to the bannerJohn Edwardsseeking the Democrats’ nominationsaid at a town hall meeting in Seattle today“All the photo ops in the world can’t hide the truth – his disastrous mismanagement of the war has left our troops in harm’s way and made Iraq a breeding ground for terrorists.”

“When the president vetoes the billit is George Bush who is not supporting our troopsand nobody else,” he added.

Americans United for Changea liberal grouphas been running an ad nationwide since Friday comparing Mr. Bush’s 2003 declaration with footage of violence since then. “He was wrong thenand he is wrong now,” an announcer says before urging Mr. Bush not to veto the bill.

Text of President Bush’s Statement

Update: The Democrats’ leaders in CongressSenator Harry Reid and Representative Nancy Pelosijust held a brief press conference.

“In the coming dayswe’ll continue to reach out to the presidentand we hope congressional Republicans who remained silent—congressional Republicans through this whole debate—will work with us as well,” said Mr. Reid. “But if the president thinks that by vetoing this bill he’ll stop us from working to change the direction of the war in Iraqhe is mistaken.”

 7509,  1964, a, WHEN Joan Fleming received the Crime Writers Association's top award last year for “When I Grow Rich,” I was delighted not only by this prize for one of my own favorite suspense novelsbut by the overdue recognition of the author herselfa consistently admirable and versatile maker whose entire corpus of novels is a distinguished one. As I have often remarkedshe never writes the same book twicebut even she reaches a new extent of versatility in THE CHILL AND THE KiLL (Washburn$3.95)which should be eagerly claimed by the science‐fiction enthusiasts as well as by the suspense buffs,

For this is about a genuine case of extrasensory perceptionparticularly precognition. A hitherto unexceptional adolescent girl developsafter the shock of a minor accidenta wild talent for foretelling the future: marriagesarrivalsdeaths and a murder. But such startling aperçus are often imperfect; and when the foreseen murder happenseven the young prophetess does not know whodunit. This is an adroit plot for combining mystery and s.f. (though Miss Fleming and Dr. J. B. Rhine might argue that E.S.P. should by now be classed as recognized fact)and the treatment is excellent—a fine depiction of an English village rich in complex and unstereo typed charactersincluding the sensitively drawn E.S.P.er herself.

One of fiction's best private detectivessolidly and humanly in the Hammett (rather than the Spillane) traditionis the Chicago eye whose only name is Mac. In Thomas B. Dewey's DON'T CRY FOR LONG (Simon & Schuster$3.50)he becomes accidentally (and without pay) involved in the affairs of a controversial Congressman with a sexy and treacherous daughter. Strong suspensehard actionfirm characterizations.

Lighter variants of the private eye: Shell Scott encounterson an Arizona dude rancha gaggle of gangsters and the all‐female cast of a nude Western film in Richard S. Prather's THE COCKEYED CORPSE (Gold Medal40 cents). The action is as briskly entertaining as the title is irrelevant. . . . Rick Holmanin Carter Brown's MURDER IS A PACKAGE DEAL (Signet40 cents)undertakes to free a fading filmstar from blackmail and walks into two murders. Conventonal but fastwith a few nice macabre touches. . . Mavis Seidlitzin order to protect a threatened stripperturns stripper herself in Carter Brown's TIHE BUMP AND GRINND lMURDERS (Signet40 cents). Some of Mavis's Gracie ‐ Allen ‐ plus sex humor is as strained as her bra‐straps; but the plot culminates in a fine sequence of double and triple crosses.
 2995,  2002, a, Mr. Young has left stage managing and says he is now in a ''career crisis,'' working as an administrative assistant while he figures out what he wants to do next.

Although it has taken more than a year to complete the apartmentthe major work took place over three monthsand during that time they moved with their two dogs into a small studio. When they moved backthey were so thrilled by its transformation that all four of them ran through the new rooms.

The apartment is entered through a foyer that at Mr. Egozi's suggestion retained the lower ceilingsto make the height of the main room more dramatic by contrast. He also suggested using floor-to-ceiling doors in the powder room off of the foyer''to give a sense of grandeur,'' Mr. Odorisio said.

In their large kitchenboth the counters and island are finished in concreteinstalled by Smoothcretea Canadian company with low prices that they found on the Weband which works all over North America.

They love the smoothcool feel of their countersand the look. ''I love that it has impurities,'' Mr. Young said. ''People askdoes it stainand I sayyeah,'' he added happily.

The counter includes a cutout with a top for garbage and a trough behind the faucet that holds pebbles and bamboo. Although it looks like the result of an aesthetic decisionit was placed there to keep water from dripping over the counter and to obscure the fact that they did not rebuild the window to make its bottom flush with the counter.

Keeping plants alive proved a challenge in a room with little natural light. The bamboo was the winner after wheat grass and yucca failed to thrive.

 2046,  2007, a, I always knew I was special. And now research from San Diego State University proves that I am just as unique as everybody else: I and my collegiate peers are 30 percent more narcissistic than the fluffy-haired and spandex-clad college students of 1982.

I’m not sure how something like this is measuredbut apparently our inflated self-confidence follows us into the workplace. In an article entitled “The Most-Praised Generation Goes to Work” [$]Jeffrey Zaslow of The Wall Street Journal explores this “culture of praise,” noting an increase in the need for approval among workers in their 20s and the hiring of corporate “celebration assistants,” who help teach managers to compliment young employees with encouraging e-mailprizes and “public displays of appreciation.”

NowI enjoy a compliment on a job well done; no one likes to go unnoticed. But I don’t know that I require more praise than older people in order to perform the same level of work.

It may be true that our parents tended to over- rather than under-praise us. But I suspect that it is simply feedbackrather than praisethat my age group craves. I can’t speak for more than a handful of my friends and myselfbut I know that I feel anxious when I have no inkling of how I’m doing. Growing up with the Internet embedded in my daily lifeI’m used to hearing from people constantly. When I hear nothingmy hyper-connected self assumes that I’m performing at a mediocre levelif not doing something wrong.

Onlineeverything is instantaneously judged. Anyone who has access to a computer has a voiceand everyone’s opinion can be recorded. Being able to post amateur photographs or writing and receive comments from anonymous readers in Japan and Kansas contributes to an inflated ego.

Yet a touch of cynicism taints the complimentary experience. In a world where people can become famous by videotaping themselves stuffing a record number of marshmallows into their mouthsit’s hard to take praise seriously. Public attention and affection seems to be shifting away from the accomplished and toward the abnormal.

The striking downside to an institutionalized celebration assistant is that workers may no longer feel unique or singled out for their work. If it’s someone’s job to tell you that you’re fabulousand if your cubicle-mates are also regularly showered with confettithe praise rings hollow. Specificcontent-driven feedback is what we neednot praise for simply showing up to work or performing a basic job requirement.

Do employers truly consider us thinner-skinned than previous generations? I think we’re merely more high-strung. With colleges graduating more and better-educated students than in years pastthe competition for even entry-level positions can be fierce. It’s become increasingly difficult to turn down any opportunities that fall in front of us. So we’re taking on responsibilities earlier in our lives than our elders did.

A good friend who had an internship the summer leading up to his senior year received a job offer starting in the fallwhen he was still busy completing his last semester of schoolwork. As he thumbed through his Blackberry after – and frequently during – classhis furrowed brow and frazzled demeanor belied his image as a calm professional. In facthe felt trapped by his opportunity; he couldn’t turn it downregardless of the toll it took on his personal life.

The weight of responsibilities like these adds upas each one is precariously balanced. While we’re building our platforms to become the Professional American 2.0taking on the jobs that society offersmaybe we need reassuring feedback in order to cope.

Is a little bit of ego-stroking too much to ask?
 2697,  2003, a, But getting rid of a big distortion requires a bigger tax cut than getting rid of a small one. Thanks to all those tax-sheltered accountsexempting dividend income from individual taxes could cost only half as much as making companies' dividend payments tax-deductible. Exempting only part of the dividend from taxationas the Bush administration is expected to proposewould cost the Treasury even less. And most policy makers would rather keep the money in Washington.

Giving individual investors a break on their dividend income already subjects politicians to demagogic attacks as friends of the rich. Cutting corporate taxeseven to eliminate distortionsis politically dangerous.

In a campaign''my opponent supported tax breaks for giant corporations'' is even nastier than ''my opponent supported tax breaks for wealthy investors.'' Sounder tax policy hardly seems worth the trouble.

The second good idea gone bad is cutting the payroll taxwhich takes 6.2 percent of everyone's paycheck from the first dollar of income up to a limitset in 2002 at $84,900. Employers pay an equal amount for the privilege of employing people. The employer tax does not show up on the FICA line of your pay stubbut it nonetheless increases the gap between what you take home and what you cost the company.

Reducing the payroll tax would give every worker an immediate tax break and encourage companies to hire (or retain) employees. It's a winning idea whether you're looking for a Keynesian jolt to consumer spending or a supply-side boost to hiring. And it would particularly benefit low-income workerswho pay little or nothing in federal income taxes but still owe payroll taxes.

The problem arises in defining what it means to ''cut the payroll tax.'' A permanent rate reductionthe ideal reformis not what lawmakers have in mind. The most common suggestion is a one-year exemption on the first $10,000 or $15,000 of income. This idea has two problems.

To spur either spending or long-term hiringincome tax cuts need to be permanentnot short term.

Of courseemployers and workers would appreciate even a one-year breakespecially a large one. The idea is a political winnerbut a temporary cut does little to encourage hiring or spending.

General Manager Sandy Alderson has continued to make it clearthrough both actions and wordsthat he is less than confident about the state of the Mets’ bullpen.

Looking for a reliable arm for the middle inningshe has added veterans like Pedro FelicianoScott Atchison and LaTroy Hawkins on minor league contracts in recent days.

But part of the concern has centered on closer Frank Franciscowho will earn $6.5 million this season. Franciscowho had 23 saves and a 5.53 earned run average during an erratic campaign last seasonhad surgery in December to remove a bone spur from his elbow.

Alderson did not hesitate to suggest during an interview Thursday night on SNY that the Mets could pursue a bigger name to help take care of the late-innings responsibilities.

“Coming out of last seasonlooking with what Frankie has been dealing with in the off-season as far as his elbow is concernedI don’t know that we could have a lot of confidence in where we are,” Alderson said. “I hope that Frankie is able to step up. We’ve taken a lot of the time to look at other possibilities and ways that we can shore this up.”

He added“I think we’re going to have another guy or two between now and spring training,” though he did not specify what caliber of pitcher that could be.

One option the Mets have considered is Jose Valverdewho could compete for the closer roleaccording to an ESPN New York report Friday.

Valverde34saved 35 games for the Detroit Tigers last year but fell apart toward the end of the season. He posted a 5.02 E.R.A. in Septemberand he was removed from the closer role by Manager Jim Leyland during the playoffs.

As Alderson saidthe Mets are “not terribly comfortable” looking at Francisco as their closer. So the search for reliable arms will continue.

Mets Sign Byrd The Mets signed the veteran outfielder Marlon Byrd to a minor league contract and invited him to spring trainingthe club announced Friday night.

Byrd35was an All-Star for the Chicago Cubs in 2010. Last yearhe batted .210 in 47 games combined for the Cubs and the Boston Red Sox. He was released by the Red Sox on June 12. Later that monthhe received a 50-game suspension for testing positive for Tamoxifen.
 1824,  2008, a, Fernando Ferrerthe former Bronx Borough president and mayoral candidatedropped in to an East Side sports bar on Thursday night to kick off a Democratic debate-watching party organized by the Committee of Latinos for Hillary. The barTonic East on Third Avenue in Murray Hillwas pumped with dance music and the raised voices of young professionals straining to chat. A mosaic of big-screen televisions flashed hockey and basketball games. But the high energy wasn’t for Hillary. Amid the regular Thursday night revelryin a corner of a second-floor balconya small crowd of suit-clad Clinton supporters waited for the candidates to speak.

Mr. Ferrera seasoned politician who has been a government relations consultant since his unsuccessful challenge to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in 2005welcomed the 25 or so attendees with a joking apology. “It’s been a long time since I’ve addressed supporters from the back of a bar. I’m a little out of practice,” he said into a microphone over the din.

Support for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is strong among New York City’s Latino voters. Nearly all of the most prominent state and city Latino politicians have lined up between Mrs. Clintonwho has also received intense coverage in the Spanish-language press.

Other debate-watching events in the city had bigger crowdsbut this one ended up feeling more like an informal get-together for some key campaigners in Latinos for Hillary than a rousing rally. While there were some Hillary buttonsfor examplethere wasn’t a Hillary sign in sight.

With the noise level in the bar so loud that hearing the debate took full attentionthere was also little outward reaction to what was shown on the screen. Obama attracted some nods with his explanation of comprehensive immigration reformespecially his insistence on creating a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Butsaid Julissa Reynosoa lawyer on the Latinos for Hillary steering committeeHillary’s detailed answer “simply had more meat on it.”

“Latinos really connect with Hillary because they feel she has a real sense of compassion for what we are going through,” she said.

One thing the Clinton supporters wanted to dispel was the idea that Latinos wouldn’t vote for Mr. Obama because of historic tension between blacks and Latinos. “This is not about being against Obama,” Mr. Ferrer said. “This is about being for Hillary. I am absolutely living proof that blacks and Latinos can come together in an election coalition. It’s what happened for me in 2001 and 2005.” The strong support he received from both groups was not enoughthoughin his two unsuccessful campaigns for mayor (in the abbreviated and subdued campaign after the Sept. 11 attackshe lost the postponed 2001 Democratic primary to Mark Greenwho was then defeated by Mr. Bloomberg.)

“Hillary’s relationship with the Latino community has always been strong,” Mr. Ferrer added. “It’s a long relationship based on real achievementsnot something that happened two weeks ago. She’s stood with us on health careon access to capital. She’s been with us absolutely every step of the way since the White House.”

While pro-Clinton feeling dominatedmany of her supporters also echoed the on-stage camaraderie shown by the two candidates. Marcos Vigila 32-year-old lawyer who organized the eventsaid that while he thought Mrs. Clinton would make the better presidenthe would still be satisfied if Mr. Obama were the nominee.

As the debate wound into its second hourMr. Vigil said he was impressed by how alike many of the two candidates’ policy proposals were. “Hillary’s seen it all. She knows what to expectand she understands how the bureaucracy works. But whichever candidate Democrats put forwardwe will rally around,” he said.

And whom do you sell it to? Wellto people you really like. And maybe at a bargain price.

The National Catholic Reporter is running a cover story on the sale of church property to the Follieri Groupan investment concern with purported ties to the Vatican.

“They don’t want to compete,” said a real estate professional who dealt with the firm on a multiple-property offering in a Midwestern archdiocese. In this casesaid the professionalthe Follieri Group attempted to short-circuit the established procedures by ignoring the brokers hired by the diocese and making its offer directly to the church for the multiple properties.

The accompanying editorial calls for accountability when it comes to the church’s business practices.

Bonus: There’s a celebrity angle heating up this tale.

Thanks to his relationship with burgeoning Hollywood star Anne Hathaway (the princess of “The Princess Diaries” and most recently Lureen in “Brokeback Mountain”)Raffaello Follieri is more likely to be featured in New York’s tabloid newspaper gossip pages or paparazzi-like Web sites than on the financial pages.

Dear Diary:

The other afternoon we encountered a youngharried yuppyish matron in the mailroom of our East Side apartment house. As she fumbled for her mailbox keyshe kept muttering a litany of complaints to herselfranging from an absent nanny to her husband's shirtsa thoughtless business partner and a missed yoga class. A tiny infant slept peacefully at her breastcradled in a sling.

She left the mailroom and in the lobby claimed a double carriage in which sat two angelic little girls -- twinsabout 2. In the elevatorwith the buttons pushedI asked if they were identical. The harried mother looked at me. ''We don't know yet,'' she said in a flip tone. ''We haven't had time to checkwe haven't time to do anything. But don't bother to tell me how cute or adorable they are unless you're willing to take them off my hands for the weekend.'' Alan Mount

Buck Glenn was waiting in line to buy stamps at a West Village post office. The woman in front of him was accompanied by her daughterperhaps 3 years old. The child was playing with the postage forms and envelopes. ''Come here,'' the mother saidand the girl ran to heraccidentally knocking over a pile of IRS tax forms. The child stared at the forms on the floor and then stomped on them. The mother simply said''Well donedear.''

Dear Diary:

My mother's Cartier watch had stoppedand as it was a lovely dayshe decided to walk to Cartier instead of taking a taxi. Her arthritic knee acted upthoughand as she tottered into the store she was badly in need of help. She went to the nearest counter and said''Young mando you think you could find me two aspirin?'' Not a usual request at CartierI am surebut he responded with alacrity and returned with the aspirin and a glass of water. She then went to the watch departmentwhere they quickly repaired the timepieceand she took a cab home.

''And somy dear,'' she told me (I live in Tucson) ''if you're ever in New York and need an aspirinjust go to Cartier and ask.''

 3576,  1998, a, The bond market ended 1997 on a high note yesterdaystrengthening prices and leaving the yield on the most widely followed United States Goverment security near the lowest level in more than four years.

Traders said the outlook for further bond market gains in 1998 remained favorable.

The 30-year benchmark Treasury bond increased 19/32 to a price of 102 21/32 in an abbreviated New Year's Eve session. . Its yieldwhich moves in the opposite direction to price and is a barometer of interest rate trendsfell to 5.92 percent from 5.97 percent on Tuesday.

Yesterday's yield was near the 5.87 percent low for the year reached Dec. 23which was the lowest since October 1993. It was also sharply below the 6.64 percent at the end of 1996. The high yield this year for the 30-year bond was 7.17 percentreached April 14.

Traders were emboldened to buy bonds yesterday partly because of economic data that continued to suggest that economic growth is slowing and inflation remains benign. The December Chicago Purchasing Managers Indexa bellwether of a nationwide report on domestic manufacturing to be released Fridayfell to 58.1 compared with 60.5 in November. The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators for November showed a rise of one-tenth of 1 percentthe same rate of gain as in October.

 5495,  1987, a, ''Nowit's all about a legacy for this team and for Kareem,'' Riley said. ''That's the only thing left for them at this point. Once he leaves there'll be a newfresh challenge. Another ring? That's not enough. When I asked them who they thought the greatest team ever wasthe only team out of their lips was Boston. Every time anyone looks at Russellall they think of is the respect he achieves through his association with that team. These guys have a chance to attain that same kind of respect.''

In factthe Lakers are well stocked and well prepared to defend their titleperhaps more so than any champion in the last 18 seasons. But talent and preparationas many of their predecessors have proveddo not assure any team of repeating. Other factors conspire to undermine the champion's resolve. Jealousy? If this was to have afflicted the Lakersit would have done so last season when Riley passed the torch of leadership from Abdul-Jabbar to Johnson. With that torch came a season in which Johnson took more shots and scored more points than he had in any of his seven previous seasonsand won the most valuable player award for the first time. Rather than resist what was a drastic changethe Lakersincluding Abdul-Jabbarseemed inspired by it.

Byron ScottJames WorthyMichael Cooper and even Abdul-Jabbar all either had what Riley calls ''career seasons'' or surpassed their achievements of the previous season.

''I think everybody has taken their game to a higher level,'' said Scottthe Lakers' other guard. ''We all still take our cues from Magic. It's worked so far.''

This seasonJohnson and his lucrative smile dominate the cover of the team's media guideclutching the golden championship trophy behind smaller images of Abdul-JabbarCooperWorthy and Riley. So farcopies of the book have not been passed around the locker room. Greed? It often happens that teams are weakened by the desire of players to cash in on their championship seasonsor the feeling by management that it must make personnel changes in order to avoid stagnation. Either the team loses one or more players through free agency or it executes a tradeor players press for renegotiation of their contractsall of which tinker with the championship team's already-delicate balance. For examplein the year following the Seattle Supersonics' championship season in 1979tensions between starting guardsDennis Johnson and Gus Williams - primarily over money - and their coachLenny Wilkensbegan a long decline for that team.

On Friday evening at the Forumperhaps all but one of the 12 players who were members of the championship team will be present to receive their rings. Adrian Brancha bit playeris on the verge of losing his place on the roster to Milt Wagnerthe former Louisville guardor Jeff Lampformerly of Virginia.

And the only player who has crowed for a raise is Johnsonwho is unhappy with his $1 million salary (even with $1.5 million in deferred money starting in 1994)which is about $2.5 million less than what Abdul-Jabbar earns. Jerry Bussthe team ownerwill probably settle the issue before it becomes a problem. Injuries? This is the one area over which no one has controland it is already beginning to have an effect. Johnson played in only three games during the exhibition season because of tendinitis in his left anklea condition that will require him to wear a specially constructed shoe and perhaps undergo regular treatment. And last weekWorthy suffered a sprained ankle in an exhibition game against the Nets. It was not diagnosed as being severealthough Worthy has missed two games.

''In Dual-Faith Families Children Struggle for a Spiritual Home'' [ Home SectionAug. 18 ] by Ari L. Goldmantouches three generations of our family: My Christian parentsmyself as a converted Jew and my adult children.

As a ChristianI married a Jewish man and remained a Christian after my children's births. (I later converted to Judaism.) It took me many years of discussionargumenttears and two children before this situation moved from impasse to resolution. In the endI agreed to raise my children in the Jewish faith. Being a partner in an interfaith marriage is rarely simple or easyand putting to rest the guilt I experienced at disappointing my parents was no exception.

I believehoweverthat time has proven the approach right. While my children were raised in the Judaic traditionthe religious identity turned out to be less important than the fact that they have developed an assurance and integrity directly related to their self-recognition as Jews. I am certain their characters would have developed in much the same way had they been raised in a Christian home.

My experience in counseling many mixed-marriage couples has reinforced my belief in the need to provide children of such marriages with a sense of religious structure.

Statement from the President of the United States

Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency. When he was firedhe not only lost his jobhe lost his mind. Steve was a staffer who worked for me after I had already won the nomination by defeating seventeen candidatesoften described as the most talented field ever assembled in the Republican party.

Now that he is on his ownSteve is learning that winning isn’t as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victorywhich was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country. Yet Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans. Steve doesn’t represent my base—he’s only in it for himself.

John Starks had left the team earlier this season to be with the grandmother who raised hima woman dealing with the latter stages of the disease.

And now thisanother jolt from his insulated basketball world.

There were maybe 20,000 people at Madison Square Garden tonight who wanted and needed Starks to do what he has been doing so well for this franchise since he stopped bagging groceries after college. With their team on the brinkthey needed yet one more emotional rescue from elimination.

But that phrase is for basketball. This was life. How do you concentrate on your job when the people who brought you into this world and raised you are seriously ill or dying?

Everyone will talk about last night's fight after Game 4the most violent and enduring image from this ugly rivalry. But in the skewed little world of sportLarry Johnson versus Alonzo Mourning was minuscule next to Starks's battlethe emotions tugging at him tighter than any Miami Heat player grabbing his jersey coming off a screen.

 5629,  1986, a, ''Break It Down,'' Lydia Davis's new collection of fictionjust out from FarrarStraus & Girouxgives us 34 stories in 177 pages. Half a dozen of these ''stories'' are no more than a page - or a paragraph - long. The one called ''Safe Love'' reads in its entirety:

''She was in love with her son's pediatrician. Alone out in the country - could anyone blame her.

''There was an element of grand passion in this love. It was also a safe thing. The man was on the other side of a barrier. Between him and her: the child on the examining tablethe office itselfthe staffhis wifeher husbandhis stethoscopehis beardher breastshis glassesher glassesetc.''

As part of a larger narrative collage this fragment might help shed light on certain characters or a situation. And aloneit might serve as a good idea for a storyeven a good idea for a good story. As it standshoweverit's nothing but an unrealized sketcha free-floating bit of prose. Why thenone wondersdid Ms. Davis - who elsewhere in ''Break It Down'' demonstrates a gift for narrative complexityan ability to capture and orchestrate emotional nuances -choose to include such flimsy pieces in this volume?

The thing isMs. Davis is hardly alone in publishing the sort of fragments that writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald used to relegate to their notebooks. Michelangelo Antonioni's new bookfor instanceconsists entirely of what he calls ''nuclei'' - that isscenarios for possible films. Some of the entries in ''That Bowling Alley on the Tiber'' sound like newspaper clippingsdescribing heavily ironic events (i.e.some people go on a crocodile hunt and are subsequently eaten by their would-be prey); others are nothing but perfunctory descriptions of vaguely ominous landscapes.

In a sensesuch ''stories'' represent another dead end reached by the Minimalism so popular in the last decade. Spareness of expressiona willful refusal to impute motive or interpret characteran inability or unwillingness to use the conventions of traditional narrative - all were initially strategies invoked by writers to portray the alienation experienced by a generation. And they were strategies that mirroredin their very formthe post-60's sense of discontinuity and flux. In the hands of such writers as Raymond Carver and Ann Beattiethis approach could result in tightly controlled works of considerable emotional power; but at its worstit dwindles into a grudging fiction in which the white space between the words and lines seeps into - and subsumes - the actual stories.

 3424,  1999, a, To the Editor:

Alan Greenspanthe chairman of the Federal Reservecorrectly recognized President Clinton's proposal to ''save Social Security'' by investing a portion of it in the stock market as politicizing the monetary policy apparatus that took a century to de-politicize. Robert B. Reich (Op-EdJan. 26) seems to imply that it would be better to have Congress establish interest rates by a process of open public debate than to let such decisions be made behind closed doors by the Fed. Can anyone think of a better way to legislate economic catastrophe than to have Congress set interest rates?

We have now learned that the threat of deposing the President has less effect on the financial markets than the subtle implications of Mr. Greenspan's comments on interest rates. We seem finally to have a monetary system that works. It would be better not to fix it.

From its offices here at 604 Fifth AvenueHoliday Adventures will be making vouchers available to participating advertisers that will be good for free rooms at thousands of hotels around the world.

According to Elaine Taylor-Gordonwhose year-old agency Taylor-Gordon Aarons & Company has just been assigned Holiday Adventuresthe vouchers will be used as premiums. She said that hotels are giving up their rooms with their only incentive being the hope that the guests will then pay for other available servicessuch as food and drink.

Anyone with a U.S. address who will be 18 or older on SundayNovember 12009may apply for entry until 11:59 p.m. on June 12009. (The deadline for international entries has already passed.)

The New York Road Runners will hold the drawing on Wednesdayso people should be able to check their status online on Thursday. They will also be notified via e-mail on Thursday.

New York Times writer Liz Robbinsauthor of “A Race Like No Other: 26.2 Miles Through the Streets of New York” (Harper)warns that it takes a lot of luck to win a lottery slot. In 2008nearly 57,000 people entered the lotterybut only 5,600 were accepted.

“I always joke that it’s easier to get into Harvard than the New York City Marathon,” she says.

But it’s worth a try. If you don’t make itcheck back with the Run Well series later this week and we’ll explore the various charity options that guarantee willing fundraisers a spot in the marathon. We’ll also take a look at other localnational and international marathon options for the lottery rejects.

 2651,  2004, a, On our way to a screening of "Shark Tale," my daughter and I fell into a discussion of "Finding Nemo," a movie she has seen several dozen times. The subject came up naturally enoughsince the movie we were about to seewhich opens nationwide todayis DreamWorks's attempt to follow Disney and Pixar into the lucrative and technologically demanding world of underwater computer-generated 3-D animation. In anticipation of the novel delights of "Shark Tale," my daughter was happy to revise her earlier high opinion of "Nemo." "It's about a fish who gets lost," she said with a shrug. "That's not really very interesting."

As if on guard against such jadednessthe makers of "Shark Tale" have ensured that their movie is about as many things as possibleincluding a fish who gets lostthough not quite in the way that Nemo did. The busy storyin any casewith its predictable messages -- Be who you are! Don't forget where you came from! Fish are friendsnot food! -- is secondary to the packaginga brighthectic swirl of easy jokes and accessible pop-culture allusions.

There are cheerful quasi-ethnic stereotypes -- jellyfish Rastafariansshark Mafiosiaquatic ghetto kids with cans of spray paint -- that are technically insulated against offensiveness becausewellthey're all fish. There are movie-star voices galore -- Robert De NiroWill SmithRenée ZellwegerJack BlackAngelina Jolie -- and evenmore unusuallya recognizable movie-director voice and caricature. I'm relieved (and maybe just a tiny bit disappointed) to report that when Sykesa fast-talking blowfish with bushy eyebrowsappeared on screenmy daughterwho is 5did not lean over and whisper"Heyisn't that Martin Scorsese?"

But of course Mr. Scorsese was not there for her benefit. Like the "Shrek" picturesalso from DreamWorks"Shark Tale" lobs a barrage of movie and television references over the heads of the children in the audience and into the faces of their parents. Some of these are visuallike Sykes's resemblance to the auteur reading his lineswhile others pop up on the soundtrackwhich quotes the scores from "The Godfather," "Car Wash" andof course"Jaws." For the finalefishy likenesses of Christina Aguilera and Missy Elliott strut and prance while the real-life divas sing us through the closing credits.
 152,  2018, a, But Ms. Kotba longtime fan favorite for her freewheeling segments with Ms. Giffordhas provided more than a steadying handand may even have given the show a boost. NBC has defeated its ABC rival “Good Morning America” every week since Mr. Lauer was removedsomething it had not done for four consecutive weeks in more than five years.

The “Today” lead has narrowed — the program averaged around 4.4 million viewers the week before Christmasabout 54,000 viewers more than “G.M.A.” — and there is some uncertainty whether the lead is sustainable. Furtherall three morning shows experienced rating drops last year.

A surprise boon from an emergency host isn’t new at NBC. When Brian Williams was suspended for six months in 2015 from his evening newscast after he was caught embellishing stories about a Middle East reporting assignmentLester Holt replaced him and the show’s viewership figures were strong. Mr. Holt became the permanent replacement later that year.

Likewisethe departures of Charlie Rose from “CBS This Morning” and Mr. O’Reilly from Fox News after public allegations of sexual misconduct have done little to disrupt either network. Fox News is still No. 1 among cable news networks in prime timeand the ratings for “CBS This Morning” have held steady while Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell continue in Mr. Rose’s absence. (CBS has not yet hired a replacement.)

Ms. Kotb cut her teeth as a local reporter and anchorincluding a six-year stint for the CBS affiliate in New Orleans. She joined NBC in 1998 as a correspondent for “Dateline.”

 3210,  2001, a, To the Editor:

Many Americans are complaining that the military tribunals for terrorists would be unfair (''President Defends Military Tribunals in Terrorist Cases,'' front pageNov. 30). It's time for these people to wake up.

This is not some storybook we live in. These terrorists do not care at all for our civil liberties or our livesand they would probably just as soon kill any American trying to stand up for their rights. The idea that we should be fair to them is utopian at best and foolish at worst.

These people view themselves as soldiers at warso let's treat them as such. It would be a terrible shame if a terrorist were on trial in a civilian court and got off on some technicality. It is better to put these people away for good. I couldn't care less about their ''rights.'' Rememberthey don't care about ours.

 2295,  2006, a, In a Square you will find nothing that resembles an actual geometric square. In factthe predominant shape is the triangleas the intersection of many randomly generated roads would dictate. For driversSquares are nightmarish; because the roads rarely intersect at the exact same placemotorists can expect to encounter a confusing battery of traffic lights and signs every twenty yards or so. After running this gauntletBoston drivers can expect smooth sailing for roughly the next quarter of a mileat which point they will come to another Square.

Harvard SquareInman Squareand Central Squarethe areas that we'll be primarily concerned with hereinall exist quite close to one another in CambridgeMassachusetts. They arenaturallymade of triangles. Taken as a groupthey form something of a triangle themselves (as is the wont of any three points). Not an isosceles trianglemind youbut a stable and powerful shape nonetheless. Inman and Central are a bit closer to each otherlinked by Prospect Street. Harvard is slightly farther offto the westlinked to Inman and Central by Cambridge Street and Mass Averespectively.

On a mapif you look at the triangle formed by these three Squaresyou might note that the shape they describe is a triangle with one dramatically acute anglethe one emanating from Harvard Square. The angle is sharp enough that the triangle looks very much like an arrowhead. If you owned a map of the entire United States big enough and detailed enough to depict the street-level configuration of this tiny section of Massachusetts-a map that would by necessity be approximately the size of your living room-you would be able to see exactly what this arrowhead is pointing at.

It's pointingmore or lessdirectly at Montana.

The President of Montana slumps low behind his desk and waits for the gunshots to stop. No doubt about itthe assassin's dead out therebut there's still a whole lot of risk from friendly fire. Dixon probably won't stop until he pumps thirty rounds into the pile of flesh that was a man thirty seconds ago.

There's a small corner of the President's mind that wonders if all the assassins that have come around here lately were actually assassins at all. By the time the President sees themthere's really not that much that can be done in the way of interrogation. They could be just ordinary visitorscouldn't they? Salesmen and milkmen and such. But why would Dixon shoot the milkman? the President wonders. No reason that he can see. Dixon likes milk.

Dixon comes in and sits in front of the President's desk. The President looks at his Secretary of Defensewatches him without moving. Dixon watches back. They spend a long while watching. The President is aware that Dixon is looking at a fiftyish "white" man whose leanyouthful pallor has given way to a fleshymottledembarrassing red-the kind of red that lets everyone know that all efforts to lay off the salty fried food have been unsuccessful. The President also can't understand why Dix seems to look the same way he did when they were twenty-five.

It's not a good momentfrom the Chief Executive's point of view. Finallythe President speaks.

"Assassin?"

"Yep."

More watching. They've been friends since they were smallbut the President feels like these quiet staring times have been getting longer lately. Hellfriends don't need to talk. That's how you know it's a friend. But these silences have been getting ... tense. Ever since he took the Oath of Office.

"No milk."

"We're out of milk?"

"Yep."

Johnny's first thought after the noise and the blood started was how incredibly clichÈ it was to have one's gun go off while one was cleaning it. Then he bled to deathrealizing all the while that thattoohad been done before. Done to deathhe thought. Ha-ha.

Fortunatelyor unfortunatelyno one came down to the basement for three days after thatso Johnny Felix Decaté didn't actually die until his grandmother opened the basement door three days later. Wellreallyhe was dead long before that. But not really. It's hard to explain.

* * *

Dr. Schrödinger was trying to explain quantum physics.

"Imagine if you will," he said"a cat in a box with a vial of deadly gaseous poison which may or may not have been bro- ken by a trip-hammer before you open the box." Everyone imagined this. "Now let me tell you thatin terms of particlesthe cat is neither alive nor dead until you open that boxbut it is in fact simultaneously alive and dead AND neither alive nor dead until a human observes it!" Everyone was thrilled. Captivated.

"Only in terms of particles and wavesof course," continued Dr. Schrödinger. "I'm not talking about a real catof course. And this is somewhat of a counterexample." No one was listening anymorethe idea was too grand. "Really," plied the doctoraware that he was losing his audience"we're talking about subatomic particles herenot cats. Not cats. Pleaselet's forget about the catokay?"

By this timeDr. Schrödinger had pushed everyone a bit too farand he was given his coat and shown to the doorstill grumbling something about being misunderstood.

In a small one-bedroom apartment in CambridgeMassachusettsDeborah Johnstone is having an orgasm.

Johnny Felix Decaté was in a bar. This was several hours after he accidentally shot and killed himself. But he hadn't been found yetso he wasn't actually dead-he was both alive and deadand neither alive nor deadand he was drinking a beer. Being dead wasn't a problem at the moment; it was just an eigenstate.

* * *

We called Dr. Schrödinger on the telephone to find out about these eigenstates. He was eager to oblige us. Franklyhe seemed a little lonely. He started to talk about subatomic particlesbut we played dumb so that he would talk about the cat and the box. He then explained it like this:

"When I say that the 'cat' is both alive and dead before human observation intervenesI mean it. It has the properties of both a dead thing and a living thing. At that pointit is said to exist simultaneously in two opposing eigenstates: alive and dead. At the moment of observationit retains all the properties of one of the eigenstates and loses all of the other's. The cat becomes either truly alive or truly dead."

Then Dr. Schrödinger let us know that this only applies to subatomic physicsthat we should substitute "particle" and "wave" for "alive" and "dead," thattellinglycomplex physical systems don't behave with the same indeterminacy.

"How would you know?" we askand he gets very quiet for a moment. Just enough time for us to hang up on the tiresome old codger.

Deborah Johnstone is still having an orgasm in Cambridge. The same orgasm. She is sitting uprightstraddled across a manher head is thrown backand rivulets of sweat are running down her neck. Her eyes are closedher jaw is clenchedand her body jerks and flails spasmodically.

Deborah has been having this orgasm for three minutesand it's a very powerful orgasmand it shows no sign of abating. In factit's intensifyingall of her soft but strong nether muscles convulsing in an uncontrollable spastic rhythm as a lowopen-mouthed moan dances around the very back of her throat.

 4048,  1996, a, ''We never had a discussion about 'Let's change your imageGeorge,' '' Mr. Rubinstein said. ''The discussion centered on'What's the best thing to do as I build a good team.' Last year George told me he wanted to build the best team he could for New York and for Yankee fansand to let that do the talking for the team.

''He's aware of all the bad publicityand this was his decisionto build the club and let people write about the club. It's been on purpose that he's given veryvery few interviews. He came up with the solutionhe stayed the courseand it was hard. During this whole yearhe wasn't boastfulhe wasn't hateful. It was an interesting effort on his part.''

Not everyone thinks that the Yankee owner has changed his stripes. ''Sports fans have the feeling that the Yankees win in spite of him,'' said Chris Russothe co-host of ''Mike and the Mad Dog,'' a popular sports call-in radio show on WFAN-AM. ''Most realize he's a pain in the neck.'' But even Mr. Russowho is emphatically not a Steinbrenner fanacknowledges a seeming change in the volatile facade.

''Last year he really ticked people off,'' Mr. Russo said''so I'm not going to give him a break just because he's had a good 11 months.''

But not only do some fans feel he has a lot of making up to dothere's also a feeling that Mr. Steinbrenner is making nice to New Yorkers before announcing that he will move the team from the Bronx to Manhattan or even New Jersey.

''He just wants to get a nice reputation before he makes the big move,'' said Frank Myers19who was outside Yankee Stadium yesterday afternoon. ''With a guy like himit always comes down to money. If he moves the stadium to a richer neighborhoodhe'll make more money.''

Mr. Steinbrenner66broke his silence briefly yesterday and spoke to a reporter on the subject of his image. He said his demeanor this season had nothing at all to do with the issue of whether he will move the team. He declined to address the question of whether he would move. As for his treatment of Mr. Showalterhe said''I will not say one bad thing about Buck Showalterbut I don't think I have to apologize for what happened.''
 4134,  1995, a, Federal regulators are proposing an unusual method to provide more educational television for children: broadcasters will be forced to carry up to five hours of educational programming a weekbut stations can pay other stations in their areas to do the job for them.

The ideawhich the Federal Communications Commission will formally propose on Wednesdayis the latest and perhaps the strangest attempt yet by the Government to promote social improvement by invoking the marketplace's self-interest.

Under the plantelevision broadcasters would be forced for the first time to carry a minimum amount of educational programming for children -- three hours a week initiallyand an increase to five hours after several years. But these requirements would be "tradable," so that a station could comply with the law by paying another station in the same city to carry all but one of those extra hours.

The proposal resembles a Government program in which companies that generate air pollution can trade "pollution credits" among themselves as a more flexible way to meet clean air requirements.

GEORGETOWNCayman Islands — Just off the tarmac at the Grand Cayman International Airportvisitors were recently greeted by colorful banners advertising the Caribbean island’s sunny offerings: waterfront seafood restaurantstax-free shopping — and hedge fund directors for hire.

In the last decadeas hedge funds ballooned in size and number to become a dominant force in the investing universedirectorship services have grown from a cottage industry into a big business on the Cayman Islands. Many funds run by United States money managers have their legal residence here for tax reasons. And because of a quirk in the island’s tax codethese funds must appoint a board.

As a resultdozens of operations have sprouted up on the Caymans to supply directorsfrom one-man bucket shops to powerhouse law firms. Directors are often Cayman-based professionals: accountantslawyers and administrators of hedge funds.

Related Links Graphic: Serving on Many Boards

They are rarely investorsthough. Ostensiblydirectors offer guidance and oversight to the funds. In returna director is typically paid anywhere from $5,000 to $30,000 a year. With more than 9,000 funds domiciled on the tiny islandbusiness is booming.

And so is a debate. Major investors and others are starting to question the value of offshore directorsespecially in light of recent hedge fund fraudsliquidations and missteps. An analysis of thousands of United States securities filings by The New York Times shows that dozens of directors sit on the boards of 24 or more funds in the Caymanswhich individually are supposed to be overseeing tens of billions of dollars in assets. Some hold more than 100 directorshipsand one particularly busy director sits on the boards of about 260 hedge funds.

“You might as well save your $5,000 and buy a rubber stamp,” said Luke Dixona senior investment manager at the British pension fund USSwhich oversees more than £32 billion ($50 billion).

Directors have also been the target of lawsuits. A recent fraud case found two directorswho happened to be relatives of the hedge fund managerliable for $111 million. The subject of directors has become an industry obsessionheadlining hedge fund conferencesincluding one in April at the Grand Cayman Ritz Carlton.

The rise of the director-for-hire business — and the questions that surround it — underscore a transition for hedge funds. As the industry sheds its cowboy culture for a more button-down approachit is adopting the structure and practices of mainstream investment firms. But even as funds hire compliance officers and marketerssome corners of the industry remain in a state of arrested development.

“The hedge fund industry is still trying to figure out what it wants to be when it grows up,” said Greg Robbinsthe chief operating officer at a unit of Mesirow Financial. “Like any industryit is just going to have to get embarrassed along the way to stop doing the silly stuff it used to do.”

The data for this article was drawn largely from filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission as part of its new oversight of hedge funds. Yet the filings do not paint a full picture. The directorships cited are only for funds with American investorsomitting thousands of funds that manage strictly overseas money.

Mesirow and other hedge fund investorsincluding USS and Man Grouphave been clamoring for greater disclosure on how many boards directors serve on. They have taken their grievances to the Cayman Islands Monetary Authoritythe local regulatorwhich has so far declined to release the information. Financial services are the island’s lifebloodaccounting for more than 35 percent of its gross domestic product and employing about 15 percent of the work forceaccording to a 2008 study by Oxford Economicsan economics consultancy.

At the heart of the hedge fund business here is Don Seymourwho has financed a mini-empire on the island with his directorship services companyDMS Management. Mr. Seymoura onetime hedge fund auditor at PricewaterhouseCoopersdeclines to say how many boards he sits onthough he says he selectively tells investors. A review of the S.E.C. filings shows Mr. Seymour occupies roughly 180 board seatsaccording to the Foundation for Fund Governance.

Mr. Seymour likens his work as a hedge fund director to that of a top doctorwho can see hundreds of patients a year. Just as every patient is not equally sickevery directorship is not equalhe says. He points to proprietary computer systems that track information about the hedge funds served by DMS directors. And associate directors at his firm handle much of the day-to-day responsibilities.

The growing debateMr. Seymour saysis driven by competitors eager to snag a share of his business.

“We have a bit of a Goldman Sachs problem,” he reflected from his company’s offices at DMS Housea slate-colored stucco building resembling the White House. “We are the worldwide leader in fund governance.”

A rival firmIMSalso serves a large swath of the hedge fund industry. Its founderPaul Harrissays focusing on numbers won’t tell investors whether a director can fulfill his responsibilities.

“Sometimes two boards are too much,” said Mr. Harriswho does not require his directors to disclose how many boards they serve on.

Mr. Seymour served as the head of investment services at the Cayman Island Monetary Authoritystarting in 1998. While at PricewaterhouseCoopershe says he audited the funds of the investor George Soros.

“I’m the guy that actually created the regulatory framework for hedge funds here,” he said in a wood-paneled conference room at DMS Houseflanked by nearly a dozen staff members. Outsidea rooster crowed in the distance.

While in that postMr. Seymour recognized there was a huge business opportunity in staffing boardsand in 2000he left the regulator to start DMS.

Mutual funds also have directorscharged with responsibilities similar to those of their hedge fund brethren. And theytoohave also come under fire for failing to protect investors. But while some directors oversee dozens of fundsthose funds are typically operated by the same mutual fund company.

With hedge fundsdirectors sit on the boards of dozens of distinct hedge fund managers. And directors face far fewer requirements than mutual fund directors.

Some large hedge fund firms don’t even bother with outsiders for their Caymans funds boardchoosing to stock their boards with people who work for the hedge funds or their lawyers.

In addition to firms like DMS and IMSlaw firms like Ogier on the Cayman Islands offer hedge funds director services. That has raised questions about the dual role they can playrepresenting the hedge fund as counseland the investors of the same fund as directors.

Citing in part those potential conflicts of interestthe prominent law firm Walkers recently sold its directorship business. Before thattwo Walkers directors had come under scrutiny for their oversight of two collapsed hedge funds of Bear Stearns Asset Managementwhich the law firm also counted as a legal services client.

“There is a trend toward complete independence,” said Ingrid Piercea partner at Walkers. “I think we’ll see more of that.”

 3432,  1999, a, The bookan argumentative memoir titled ''Truth Versus Lies,'' does not acknowledge that Mr. Kaczynski was the bomber who conducted an antitechnology campaign that killed three people and injured at least 22 from 1978 until shortly before his arrest in 1996.

As the UnabomberMr. Kaczynski wrote prolificallymost notably in a long manifesto of his ideas for which he won publication in exchange for his promise of a moratorium on killing and maiming. But the book offers his first extensive public comments since his arrest.

The 548-page manuscript includes angry assertions about the news medianeighborsteachers and acquaintances. One promiscuous woman he knewhe sayswas a ''damned animal.'' A school official was ''prissy.'' As a youthhe remembershe called his mother a ''fat pig.''

The themehoweveris that contrary to what his lawyers contendedthe author is not mentally ill.

Mr. Kaczynski was sentenced last year to life in prison without possibility of paroleafter pleading guilty so as to avoid a trial in which his lawyers intended to argue that he was acutely schizophrenic. His family had been complicit in the idea of a mental-illness defensehe sayslying about him not only to avert a trial that might have led to a death sentence but also to skirt embarrassment over abuse that his book says had been inflicted on him since childhood. It was this abuse that led to social difficulties for himhe saysbut it was more convenient for his family to maintain that he was sick.

David Kaczynski ''knows very well,'' the book says''that imprisonment is to me an unspeakable humiliation and that I would unhesitatingly choose death over incarceration.'' But his brother also knewhe writesthat a trial in which an insanity defense was offered would be too agonizing for him to bear.
 1942,  2008, a, WASHINGTON – It was Senator Barack Obama who crossed the aisle.

As the senators gathered to vote on the $700 billion financial rescue package on Wednesday eveningMr. Obama walked over to the Republican side of the chamber to extend a greeting to Senator John McCain.

He got a chilly response.

While it took Mr. Obama several seconds to make his way over to see his rivalMr. McCain barely pivoted his body as he took Mr. Obama’s hand for a handshake that lasted just a moment. The eye contact was just as brief.

The moment provided a rare element of drama in an otherwise routine evening of votes. It was a curious sight on Capitol Hillmarking the second time in less than a week that the two presidential candidates crossed paths in Washington over deliberations on the economic relief package intended to stabilize the nation’s financial system.



Mr. Obamawho first arrived on the Senate floor at 5 p.m.presented his argument in favor of the legislation in a 13-minute speech. When Mr. McCain arrived shortly before 8 p.m.he did not join other Republicans in addressing the Senate. Aides to Mr. McCain said he had already addressed the substance of the bill during a speech earlier in the day in Missouri.

As Mr. Obama worked the floor of the Senateholding a long conversation with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and walking around to greet a host of other colleaguesMr. McCain largely stayed near his seat. Republican senators wandered by to say hellobefore he walked away from the chamber.

The legislation passed by a wide marginwith spectators looking on from crowded galleries as the senators voted from their desksa procedure that is reserved as a formality on pieces of legislation that are carefully watched.

The two men each returned to the campaign trail about 9:30 p.m.with Mr. Obama setting off on a late-night flight to Michigan and Mr. McCain spending the night in Washington.

Their next scheduled meeting? Next Tuesday at their second presidential debate.

 1881,  2008, a, Usain Bolt of Jamaica set a world record for 100 meters late Saturdayrunning 9.72 and defeating the reigning world champion in the eventTyson Gay of the United Statesin what was billed as a preview of the Olympic final. About 6,500 fans watched the Reebok Grand Prix at Icahn Stadium on Randalls Island. The meet was televised live on ESPN2 and highlights were shown the next afternoon on CBS.

A short time earlier and not far awayKimbo Slice defeated James Thompson by technical knockout in mixed martial artsa sport/spectacle that isshall we saynot quite on the International Olympic Committee’s radar screen. About 8,000 fans watched the bout at the Prudential Center in Newark. The fight card was shown live in prime time by CBS.

Two sports heading in different directionsat least in the New York area.

Icahn was filled to capacity for the Reebokthe third of four major American meets in the run-up to the Olympic trials. (A day later70,000 fans in Berlin watched a Golden League track meet.) The stadium is beautifulbut its modest size can be seen as emblematic of the decline of track and field as a spectator sport in New York.

As recently as a generation agothe city was the world’s hotbed of indoor track. It had been the center of that universe for a century. For a timeMadison Square Garden hosted three major meets each season: the Millrose Gamesthe Olympic Invitational (later at the Meadowlandsnow defunct) and the national championships (later at the Georgia Domenow in Boston). Sellouts were the rule. Todayonly the Millrose remainsand 12,000 is considered a banner turnout.

Some of today’s bigger meets are held at the armory on 168th Streetlike Icahn a beautiful facility but one thatcompared with the Gardenis decidedly modest in size. And yet the renovated armory is hardly a new addition to the city’s track landscape. For decades rough-and-tumble all-comers handicap races were held on what was then an unforgiving board trackstarting early Friday evening and ending sometime around the time the sanitation crews finished their Midtown sweep. Columbia’s Baker Field had a bubble with a steeply banked board track that had once been the Garden’s. All the city’s college teams that didn’t have their own track — well into the 1970sthat meant most of them — worked out there cheek by jowl while dodging the occasional errant 35-pound weight that could and did punch a neat hole in the boards. When the world’s best came to town for the big Garden meetsthey trained theresometimes sharing the track with the collegiate rabble and the flying iron.

Track and its fall incarnationcross-countryare still extremely popular in the city as participatory sports (visit Van Cortlandt Park any Saturday in October). But puzzlinglyas more people have discovered running as a way to stay in shapefewer have taken an interest in track as a spectator sport. Long gone are the days when a Glenn Cunningham was as well known as a Babe Ruthwhen Jim Ryun was as popular as Johnny Unitas.

That’s too bad. Bolt is clearly the caliber of athlete who merits the serious attention of any sports fan. At only 21 and almost 6 feet 5 incheshe seems a preternatural talent in one of track’s glamour events. His start is remarkable for a man of his size. His midrace poise belies his relatively meager experience. His finish is devastating. That he also runs the 200 (see video below) and 400races in which his long stride is an even greater assetmakes him the most intriguing all-around sprint talent since Tommie Smith four decades ago. Combine those qualities with what is shaping up to be an epic rivalry with Gaywho has won six of their nine head-to-head races in the 100 and 200and with his countryman Asafa Powellwhose record he brokethen throw in the fact that this is an Olympic yearand there would seem to be reason enough to start following track againat least one 9.72-second slice of it.
 2439,  2005, a, Atkins Nutritionalsthe former heavyweight champion of the low-carb diet businessfiled for bankruptcy protection yesterday.

The filing is the latest attempt to salvage a troubled company. Once a high-flier with surging salesAtkins faltered as the diet fad it helped create started to wane and sales of low-carbohydrate products slowed in the second half of last year.

An Atkins spokesmanRichard Rothsteinsaid the companywhich is privately heldhad worked out agreements with a majority of its lenders that would give them equity in exchange for a reduction in debt. Mr. Rothstein said the company was seeking the bankruptcy court's approval for this plan and hoped to emerge from bankruptcy "before the end of the year."

A hearing is scheduled for today in United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.

As it faced sagging consumer demand and a marketplace glutted with low-carb products last yearthe company's operations quickly founderedmaking it difficult for it to keep up with its loan obligations. Since late 2003Atkins has been saddled with roughly $300 million of debt from a deal in which Goldman Sachs and Parthenon Capitala private equity firmbought a majority stake.
 3623,  1998, a, In the 1970's Michael Weller established himself as the unofficial biographer of the generation that came of age as flower childrenchronicling their aspirations and inevitable disillusion in plays like ''Moonchildren'' and ''Loose Ends'' and in the screenplay for the movie of ''Hair.'' In ''Ghost on Fire,'' a poignant play suffused with humorMr. Weller writes their requiem.

When we first meet him in the mid-80'sDan Rittman (Lee Sellars) is teaching screenwriting in New Yorkand an affair with a student has put his marriage to Julia (Betsy Aidem) in jeopardy. Suddenly out of the past arrives Neil Toomie (Nelson Avidon)a onetime sidekick to Dan and Julia when they made short documentary films together in their hippie days''when we believed everyone was important,'' as Dan explains at one point. Neila cameraman who stayed on in California when Dan and Julia abruptly leftis now married to a ditsy woman ''from the Bordeaux region of Texas'' and is in New York to work on a movie about ''drug abuseor is it child abuse . . . one of the abuses.''

Neilwho keeps up a steadyglib banter increasingly tinged with bitternessalso may have found an Israeli who is willing to bankroll the big feature movie he and Dan always dreamed of making. But Neil also has a secretwhich is revealed when his wifeMichelle (Dannah Chaifetz)arrives from California with some CAT scans showing he has an inoperable brain tumor.

''Ghost on Fire'' fills the stage with ably drawn characters: the vacuous but earnest soap opera actor who is so in love with Julia he has started reading philosophy (albeit at a page an hour) so he can carry on a conversation with her; a sex-obsessed doctor of dubious ethics who wants to be a poet; an upstairs neighbor who is still trying to ban the bomb; the Israeli producer with an amusing if imprecise command of English idiom and his leggy but erudite mistress.

It was Lavanya Rajamania professor at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi — not her colleague Navroz K. Dubash — who said“Stating that the Paris Agreement hamstrings the U.S. while allowing India and China to increase their emissions is baffling. The Agreement allows every country to choose its pledge tailored to its national circumstances.” The article also referred incorrectly to comments by President Emmanuel Macron of France. In criticizing Mr. Trump’s decisionMr. Macron spoke in French before switching to Englishnot the other way around.

An article last Saturday about parking permits in New York City misstated the number of placards given to city employeesas well as the total number of people employed by the city and the percentage of total placards held by city workers. About 114,600 of the placards were given to city employeesnot 160,500. As of Marchthere were 317,944 full-time city employeesnot 293,296meaning that less than a third of all city employees have parking permitsnot more than half.

 5102,  1989, a, The opportunity came for Tucker on Saturday afternoon with 11 seconds left. It was only the ninth 3-pointer in his last 49 attempts for the man Al Bianchithe team's general managercalls ''our pinch-hitter.''

''When our offense needs a boost,'' Bianchi said''and it seems like there is a lid on our basketit's time for Trent to come in and take it off.''

It hasn't always been that way for Tucker in his seven Knick reasons. He can remember Hubie Brown's coaching dayswhen calls of ''power right'' and ''power left'' rang out from the bench and he was left out of the offense. Pitino has changed all that. He introduced a running game and incorporated the 3-point shot into the offense.

''Rick is always aware where his 3-point shooters are,'' said Tuckerwho is among the league leaders from 3-point range. ''He's got a very loud voice and it carries all over the court even when the Garden is filled.

''There was a time the 3-point basket was looked upon as a desperation shot. Rick changed that. Properly executed the way we did it Saturdayit can be a thing of beauty. When I'm shooting them wellthe basket looks like one big ocean to me.''

But before Tucker found a coach who would believe in his long-range shootinghe had to change his way of lifeespecially during the off season.

''When you're young,'' said the 29-year-old Tucker''you don't always watch what you eat and you don't stay in shape. You let your youth take care of that. But when Rick came in and talked about playing a much faster gameyou have to take care of your body to play that style of basketball. It called for a lot more running and drills. I wanted to be part of itso I worked hard.''

It took Tucker only 45 games to break the club record of 69 3-pointers he set last year. This seasonhe finished with 118. Tuckerwho will be an unrestricted free agent after the seasonwould like nothing better than to ''finish my career with the Knicks.''

 1094,  2012, a, Four of the Republican presidential candidates actively campaigned in Iowa on Sundaytwo days before the state’s caucuses. This is what they were saying:

In Iowa Reporting on candidates and voters from the Hawkeye State.

Mitt Romney in Atlantic:

“I’ll let people make their own assessment of our respective recordsbut I’m a conservative.”

“I’m proud to be a conservative businessmanand what distinguishes me I think from others in the field is that I understand the economy first-hand having lived in it.”

“And I think that the people of this country recognize that with our economy as the major issue we face right nowthat it would be helpful to have someone who understands the economy first-handwho spent the bulk of his career working in the private sector.”

Newt Gingrich was in Marshalltownwhere he talked about his opponents Rick SantorumGov. Rick Perry of TexasMr. Romney and Representative Michele Bachmann:

“If you count Santorum and Perry and Bachmann and mecompared to the Romney numbersit’s going to be overwhelming that the conservative base of the party is still there and that Governor Romney remains basically a Massachusetts moderate. He has not broken out despite spending millions of dollarsand as we go on in New Hampshire and South Carolina and Floridathose numbers will ultimately prove decisive in the race.”

“I think New Hampshire is the perfect state to have a debate over Romneycare and a debate about tax-paid abortionswhich he signed.”

Mr. Santorum talking to supporters in Sioux City:

“This is the most important election in our lifetime. This is a decision as to what kind of America you are going to hand to your children and grandchildren. Are you going to leave an America that is more and more dependent on bigger and bigger government to do the things families and churches and local communities should do?”

Representative Michele Bachmann in Oskaloosa:

“Who stands for marriage between a man and a woman? Who stands for life and the protection of human life from conception to natural deathnot just to be politically popularbut who really means it? And who’s going to do something about it?”

“I am not a politician. I am not an establishment person. I am a real authentic Iowan.”

“I believe I’m the best person to take on Barack Obama and defeat him.”
 4265,  1994, a, George Youngthe Giants' general managersaid that Simms in all likelihood would have surgery but he declined to say when. When players need surgerythe Giants tend to take care of it quicklyso the procedure could take place by the end of this month.

"This is not a career-threatening thing," Young said. "Let's not be an alarmist about this. He has some problems and all indications are this will be nip-and-tuck type of surgery."

Stillsome people in the organization are slightly worried. They say arthroscopic surgery is delicate by nature and in a sense is even more delicate when performed on the throwing arm of a quarterback approaching 40.

The advantage for Simms is that he is one of the best-conditioned quarterbacks in pro football history. A major reason he has been able to play 15 years is that he takes good care of himselfengaging in extensive weight training and conditioning programs.

"I'm not worried about it," said Young. "It's not a major concern."

But if it should be a serious problemthe Giants' quarterback situation would become very interesting. The Giants would have to determine whether Dave Brown or Kent Graham is ready to step into the starting role. If Simms could not performwould the Giantswho already have a number of players who are free agentshave to look for a free-agent quarterback?
 5187,  1989, a, President Bush today reluctantly signed into law a measure creating an independent inspector general within the Central Intelligence Agency.

Creation of the new inspector general's officesimilar to those that review other Government agencies' programs and seek out abuseswas part of a broader bill authorizing intelligence activities for the coming year.

In a statementMr. Busha former Director of Central Intelligencesaid the new post ''could impair the ability of the C.I.A. to collect vitally needed intelligence information by creating a perception that confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.''

But the President said his objections were eased by a provision allowing the Director of Central Intelligence to kill any investigation he believed might compromise national security.

 2289,  2006, a, It’s time for President Bush to go to China. I don’t mean that literallybut metaphorically. It’s time for George Bush to do what Richard Nixon did – perform an act whose effectiveness is a function of the fact that he is the last man anyone would have expected to do it. What would that act be? It won’t be – and shouldn’t be – agreeing to a face-to-faceone-on-one debate with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iranif only because when you accept the other guy’s invitation you cede him the initiative and the position of leadershipand we all know that George Bush will never willingly do that. Noit has to be something that a) makes clear that he is the one in chargeand b) is so surprising and (apparently) out of character that its very announcement alters the geopolitical landscape and disarms criticism in advance.

President Bush should announce that he’s going to the Middle East for a 7-to-10-day trip and taking along Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and a few congressional leaders from both parties. He should explain that it is not his intention to negotiate anything and certainly not to ask for anything. He should say that he just wants to see firsthand what is going on in a region that is the repository of mankind’s hopes and fearsand so he will visit every countrynot only those that are already friendly to the West. He should declare that while he has every faith in U.S. intelligence and considers himself fully informed by the appropriate agenciesthere is simply no substitute for being on the ground where you can look the other fellow (or woman) directly in the eye. (He already says that all the time.)

There would be any number of upsides to this venture (or adventure) and almost no downsides. (There would be one big onebut we’ll get to that later.) First there is the political upside. Members of his own party could not demur without giving the Democrats a weapon in the upcoming elections and beyond. (Seeeven when the president comes up with a good proposalhis party’s regulars will nix it.) Democrats would be obliged to applaud the plan because it is a version of what they have been calling for all along – a turn from military action to diplomacy.

And Democrats would not be able to upstage or imitate the initiative because any unilateral visit from them would be perceived as nothing more than a political sideshowa grandstanding gesture with no real power behind it to act. Best of allthe Democratic leaders could not decline to participatefor they would then come across as (what they often are) petulantobstructionist and weak.

Then there is the upside of no possible bad outcome. If the relevant leaders refuse to host the U.S. delegationthe administration still gets both local and international credit for having been willing to go. If the leaders acceptbut the trip is so complex an undertaking that it cannot occur before the midterm elections (as would almost certainly be the case)voters will give the administration credit anyway (credit on credit) for having the idea and being ready to act on it. (And besideswhether the trip is stalledin progress or in the planning stagesall the radio and TV commentators will talk about little elseand names like Abramoff and Katrina will be distant memories.)



If the trip comes off but goes badly – ugly protests at every step; transportation foul-ups; (mild) food poisoning; potentatesprinces and presidents refusing to engage in substantive conversation – the president gets to look like a heroic warrior persevering in the face of adverse circumstances. Even if there is no apparent yieldthe yield will already have been harvested. And if the trip is a success – crowds come to jeer but end up cheeringendless photo-ops of the president interacting with the common man or woman in the streetreal conversations that produce a resolution to meet again or a joint statement declaring mutual respect and a commitment to future cooperation – the president should start writing the speech he will give when he receives the Nobel Peace Prize in Stockholm.

Then there is the historical legacy. Forget about Abu GhraibEnronHalliburtonthe Social Security fiascothe prescription drug fiascothe deficit fiascothe Iraq fiasco (the list could be continued indefinitely). President Bush will be remembered as the man who broke the Middle East impasse. The mere act of announcing the trip will be his version of “Tear down that wallMr. Gorbechev.” This is an October surprise that could keep on giving for decades and even centuriesand it would be risk-free.

Wellnot quite. There is that one downsideand its name is security. Every day hundreds of thousands of people in that part of the world declare that they want to kill George Bushand here would be the best chance they ever had to do it. Of course the security precautions would be massive. No governmenteven a government hostile to the United Stateswould want an assassination or even an attempt at an assassination to occur on its territory. And this would be one time when the hierarchical and despotic political structures about which we always complain would be a good thing: the more absolutist the regimethe more likely that it will be able to identify and control (or perhaps “detain”) persons and groups who are thought to pose a threat of violence. Stillsecurity can never be perfectly tight and the possibility that a lone wing nut (a favorite term of the political right) might get through cannot be discounted. It would then be a matter of doing a cost-benefit analysisa balancing of the danger and its likelihood against the probability of a very large success.

I’m serious. Despite the occasional tongue-in-cheek tone of the preceding paragraphsI really think this is a good idea. At the very least it would change the dynamic in the region without asking the president to yield an iota of moral or political authority.

When I was a dean – to compare great things with small – and confronted by a disruptive and obstreperous faculty member or chairpersonI would never call the difficult party into my office. Instead I would telephone and ask him or her if I might drop down and pay a visit. The result often (but notalasinvariably) was to eliminate defensiveness and improve the chances that something constructive might actually get done; and while I sat there in the uncomfortable straight-backed chairI was still dean and everyone knew it.

Now being a dean is nothing like being a presidentand walking down a few flights of stairs or taking an elevator is nothing like traveling half the world to make your way in hostile territory. But the gesture of going to someone else’s office (or house or parliament or mosque) is a powerful one that has the promise at least of wiping the slate clean and making a new beginning. It might just work. Nothing else has.
 5139,  1989, a, In 1986a Federal law addressed illegal immigration by legalizing the status of long-term undocumented aliens and imposing sanctions on employers who hire new ones. Though bureaucratic problems remain that could jeopardize some of those aliensCongress is now turning its attention to legal immigrants with a bill that confirms two worthy principles: the importance of reuniting families and America's need for skilled workers.

Under a visa allocation system enacted in 1965foreigners seeking permanent relocation in the U.S. are given preference if they have relatives here. That tends to favor immigrants from Asiathe Caribbean and Central America. It has also forced immigrants with no family tiesbut with needed job skillsto compete with relatives of U.S. residents.

A Senate billsponsored principally by Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Alan Simpson of Wyomingpassed by a vote of 81 to 17 last month. It establishes two immigration categories: family members and independentsmostly workers.

At least 630,000 would be allowed to enter each year for the next three yearsabout 136,000 more than entered in 1988. Of the total480,000 would qualify under various family preferences; 150,000 would be admitted as independents. For the first timethe law would allow admission of some independent workers - up to 54,000 - without specific jobsbut with specific skills needed in the U.S. labor market. The immigration ceiling would be reviewed and adjusted every three years.
 7456,  1964, a, The Soviet press has not given general currency to the persistent speculation abroad that the assassination of President Kennedy was the result of a plot.

It has never publicly acknowledged that Oswald spent some time in the Soviet Union.

After the immediate flush of excitement that followed the murder of the Presidentthere has been no concerted effort of the part of newspapers here to represent the assassination as the result of a dark conspiracy instigated by rightwingers because of Mr. Kennedy's efforts to improve the international climate between East and West.

Communist party propagandists are apparently reconciled to the prevalent view that Oswald carried out the assassination without any accomplice and that the killing of Oswald was the work of one manRubyand notas Soviet papers hinted at firststaged with the connivance of the Dallas police.

This general press policyhoweverhas not prevented the occasional reprinting of Western speculation in Soviet newspapers.
 6222,  1973, a, After four hard‐driving years as prosecutor in the Bronxformer District Attorney Burton B. Roberts donned the robes of a State Supreme Court justice in Manhattan yesterdayshowing no let‐up in his zeal for action.

The fiery red‐haired prosecutorwho was always ready to go to trial with one case or another—of ten big ones —had become the judge with the same idea—“Let's go to trial.”

Facing a light calendar on the first day of his 14‐year termhe could have finished his work in 15 minutes. Insteadhe had his aides “search around the other courtrooms for a case ready for trial” and succeeded in having a rape case switched over to his part by midafternoon.

By 3 P.M. Justice Roberts was in his elementinstructing a jury.

In the massive building at 100 Centre Streetwhich is usually characterized by the dungeon‐like somberness of its courtroomsa flash of sunlight literally spotlighted the new justice as he told the jury:

“While I'm the judge of the lawyou folks truly are judgestoo. You and you alone are judges of the facts.”

 6411,  1970, a, In baseballthe best relief pitchers are those who “throw strikes,” as the managers like to say.

And last nightfor the edification of 38,681 spectators at Shea StadiumRon Taylor threw strikes almost exclusively in preserving a 7‐6 victory for Jerry Koosman over the Pittsburgh Pirates and the triumph gave the New York Mets a two‐game grip on first place in the Eastern Division of the National League.

Koosman appeared about to produce his second consecutive complete‐game performance following his sore‐arm problems when Al Oliver doubled and Willie Stargell lofted a homer over the right‐field‐fence in the ninth inning.

With the Pirates only a run behindGil Hodgesthe Mets’ managerbeckoned Taylorhis right‐hand man in the bull pen. Taylor threw 11 pitches10 of which were strikesin disposing of Bill MazeroskiRichie Hebner and a pinch‐hitterJose Paganfor his ninth save of the season.

 6052,  1977, a, Government is having some difficulty defining a family. It still approves of the idea of family (except in the Justice Department's organized crime division). But there is confusion about just who belongs to a nuclear family and who belongs to an extended family and what ought to be the legal rights of each. The innocent may think that a crude kind of genetic democracy decides such things; that biologically qualified applicants belong where they wishsubject to the sufferance of matriarchs and patriarchs. But the state is getting edgy.

It took a 5‐to‐4 decision of the Supreme Courtfor instanceto reaffirm the right this week of Mrs. Inez Moore to share her “single‐family” home in East Cleveland with a sona grandson and a second grandson whose mother had died. The trouble was a zoning ordinance that allowed only one family for each dwelling unitand defined family in the nuclear sense to mean a head of householda spouseonly one of the couple's parentsthe couple's unmarried children and the minor children of only one of the children. Mrs. Moore drew a five‐day jail sentence and $25 fine because she gave shelter to two minor children of two of her children. East Cleveland argued that zoning against crowding and against extended families would be useless unless the line were drawn somewhere; given the special circumstances at the Mooresit could not understand why they refused to seek a zoning variancewhich would surely have been granted.

After four yearsand with the help of the Legal Aid SocietyMrs. Moore found a slender majority on the Supreme Court willing to strike down the law as hostile to “family itself.” “The tradition of unclesauntscousins and especially grandparents sharing a household has roots equally venerable and equally deserving of constitutional recognition,” the Court heldclearly but conservatively. Note the especially grandparents; observe that only a tradition with roots as deep as the common law itself could have survived the state's assault. One Justice siding with Mrs. Moore preferred to defend her rights in property instead of blood. And the Chief Justice did not think the Constitution should be bothered with family trees and roots as long as Mrs. Moore refused so stubbornly to treat Johnny Moore Jr. like an extension of the porchas a zoning variance.

The conflicton reflectionis not between law and nature but between myth and reality. Government must codify convention and it has codified a fiction: the family composed of male providerfemale homemakeran adorable child or two or three. Societyhoweverpersists in pruning and replanting the family tree. Half the mothers are off to work; innumerable homes are run by a single parent; youngsters flock into family communes; old folks congregate in the sun. The family becomes what the heart or stomach declares it to be.
 6236,  1973, a, Laterhis present lawyerDonald Tuckergave him $5and the former gypsy ‐ cab driver walked through the rain alone and took the subway home to his mother's apartment at 401 West 40th Street.

At his mother's apartment Mr. Garcia received the congratulations of relatives and friends late yesterday afternoon. Before that he had been busy seeing his lawyers.

I've been straightening out my life,” he said. “My wife and I have been having trouble since 1966and we have been separated for the last six years. I saw my wife and made arrangements for the support of my sonJonathan Davidwho is 6 years old.

“She will let me visit him regularlyand my chief concern now is bringing him up right. We are going to be divorced—she is giving her consent.

“My lawyers are looking for a job for me and I am also going to welfare to see if they can helpme get a job. I have to have a job to support my son.”

As news of Mr. Garcia's acquittal cittulated yesterday through the Criminal Courts Building at 100 Centre Streetwhere the case has long been a matter of considerable discussionMr. vanden Heuvel spoke out again on the subject.

“I've been pleading for months for this trial to take place,” he said.

It's an injusticehe said“to keep anyone in detention for more than 90 days without a trial.”

 4372,  1994, a, WHO has the top Top 10 list?

On this side of the field is Lehman Brothers. Every July since 1949Lehman has offered up a list of 10 best stocks for the next 12 months. But last year Shearson Lehman split upand while Lehman retained rights to the list -- Ten Uncommon Values -- Smith Barneywhich got Shearsonfelt heir to the traditiontoo. So in July it suited up a rival portfolio -- Ten Exceptional Names -- and yesterday ended the new contest's first quarter.

The resultsdividends and commissions excluded: Lehman Uncommons over the Smith Barney Exceptionals14.1 percent to 13.5 percent.

But both teams strongly outpaced the S.& P. 500up just 4.15 percent. The disparity is not unusual. Many brokerage firms have best-buy listsand they often outdo the marketsaid Rick Chrabaszewski of Zacks Investment Research. In 1990these lists' 7.25 percent loss trailed the S.& P. 500's loss of 3.1 percentfor instancebut their total returns of 50 percent in 199120.24 percent in 1992 and 19.6 in 1993 consistently outdid the 500's respective returns of 30.5 percent7.6 percent and 10.1 percent.

And the two Top 10 listssmaller than most best-buy rostersare among the pickiest of picks. Lehman's 10 Uncommons are culled from 300 buy recommendationswhich are themselves drawn from the 1,000 stocks Lehman follows. Smith Barney's Exceptionals come from the 180 high-rated buys among the 1,200 securities it tracks.

 4620,  1992, a, Someday soonthe Yankees will have a healthy bunch of players. Danny TartabullMike GallegoPat Kelly and Don Mattinglythe latest casualtywill all be ready to play. At least the Yankees think so.

Mattinglywho missed Wednesday night's gamecould return as early as tomorrow. The Yankees said Mattingly has tendinitis in the little finger on his right handand Mattingly said doctors told him he has carpal tunnel syndromea nerve disorderin his fingers. He will be examined by a hand specialist today. The ailment has bothered Mattingly since the springand his expectations of playing this weekend could be optimistic.

If there are no other injuriesthere will eventually be questions about playing time. Since Buck Showalter is an equal opportunity managerhe has spent hours wrestling with various lineups. Though Showalter will not reveal most of his ideasthere can be situations that will be quite intriguing. Pondering the Possibilities

The manager has pondered just about every possibility. He has even bandied about the idea of playing Mattingly in left field. The Don Mattingly who has already won six Gold Glove awards and is perhaps the best defensive first baseman in baseball. It would allow the Yanks to keep Kevin Maas in the lineup if Tartabull comes back as a designated hitter. But Showalter insists it is only a possibility.

 6072,  1977, a, The World Hockey Association may soon merge with the National Hockey Leaguebut the bidding war for draft choices goes on. John Fergusonthe general manager of the New York Rangersplayed his part this week in the international intrigue of secret offerslate night phone calls and quick plane trips. Yesterday he displayed the spoils—five young Canadian hockey players whom the Rangers have signed to contracts for this coming season.

The players will report to the Rangers’ special rookie campwhich will begin Sept. 11 at Pointe ClaireQuebec. Regular training camp is scheduled a week later at Long BeachL.I.

One Choice Is ‘Shanghaied’

A tour of the southern city and a date with Miss Alabama had been arranged. “He was shanghaied!” charged one Birmingham official,

By empowering a negotiating committee last week to work out an agreement with the W.H.A.the N.H.L. effectively spurred some of the other league's members into confident and aggressive pursuit of their 1977 junior selections. “Expecting and amalgamation,” said Harrison Vickerspresident of the Houston Aeros“we thought it was probably a good idea to have a competitive draft and so we went out and got our man.” Scott Campbella defenseman who was St. Louis’ first pick and ninth over all in the N.H.L. draftwill play with Houston next sea

THURSDAY’S PUZZLE — I don’t remember the last time I saw a quip theme in a New York Times puzzlemostly because Will Shortz generally doesn’t run them. Todayhoweverhe makes an exception for Stu Ockmanwho is also making his debut. I asked Mr. Shortz why quip themes run so rarelyand he responded:

“Generally speakingquip themes are not as interesting as more traditional themes because they give the solver only one “Aha!” (usually at the end)whereas a traditional theme provides a little punch with each entry. Thereforefor a quip or quote theme to be worth devoting an entire puzzle tothe “Aha!” needs to be really bigsuch as by being very funny or very interesting. Most quips and quotes just don’t have that big a punch. Alsoit’s really hard to get quips and quotes that appeal to a broad range of solvers. A quip that’s funny to one solver probably won’t be funny to someone else. I think quip and quote themes are worth running once in a whileas with [Mr. Ockman’s] puzzlefor variety’s sake — just not too often.”

Mr. Ockman quotes the philosopher Confucius in his gridand I personally couldn’t agree more with the quote. We learn many things in life — especially from crossword puzzlesam I right? — but the older we getit seemsthe more we realize how little we actually know. Don’t even get me started on trying to remember where I put my car keys.

I was surprised to see that the nicelong Down 15s — IN ALL LIKELIHOOD and BEETHOVEN’S NINTH — were not first-timersand I wasn’t partial to the partial A LET at 61 Across. I’m not even sure what a let really is in tennisand I sure didn’t like it as a partial fill-in-the-blank.

All in allhoweverthis was a nice debut.

Some parents in China are embracing the return of Confucian philosophy as a means of educating their children:

But you knew I’d have to include this as welleven though Confucius was thoughtlessly left out:

Constructor’s Notes

If I don’t succeed in embarrassing myself with my first puzzle (be gentleRex)I’ll surely succeed with these constructor notes. I’m a civil engineer in real lifeand I’ve always found constructing things to be an enjoyable challenge. I started solving crossword puzzles in sixth gradeand New York Times crosswords a year later. So when Adam Perla longtime friend and college classmatementioned that his crossword would be in The New York Times on Thursday (at the very end of a long phone call)I started to research crossword construction on the Web. Soonarmed with a trial version of Crossword CompilerI submitted my first puzzle to Will on Christmas Day2010. Andthe rest is history! In case you’re still readingthat particular puzzle has never appeared in The New York Times. ButI’ve learned a lot from Will’s suggestionsand Adam is the best crossword mentor in upstate New York (it was Adam’s 16th New York Times crossword). Thanks Willand especiallythanks Adam! I couldn’t have done it without you two. In my first dozen puzzlesI tried three with what I thought were great quotes. “They have miscalculated me as a leader”a George W. Bush malapropismsadly (depending on your political point of view)did not make the cut. “I made a killing on Wall Street a few years ago. shot my broker”by Groucho Marxwas rejected with a note that The New York Times almost never runs quip-themed puzzles. Finallyscouring the Internet for suitable materialI stumbled on the Confucius quote featured in tomorrow’s puzzle. Hope you enjoy it.

 434,  2016, a, Cirque du Soleilciting creative differencessaid it had made a late-in-the-game decision to replace one of the lead actors in its first Broadway showthe musical “Paramour.”

The company said it was replacing Bradley Deanan actor who most recently appeared on Broadway in “Doctor Zhivago” and “The Last Ship,” with Jeremy Kushnierwhose Broadway credits include “Footloose,” “Jersey Boys” and “Jesus Christ Superstar.”

The timing is extraordinarily awkward — Mr. Dean performed the lead role of a movie producer at a press preview on Thursday. On Friday afternoonScott Zeigerthe head of Cirque’s new theatrical divisionsaid he had decided to make the change.

“Bradley Dean is an extraordinary actorand won the part for all the right reasonsbut we all felt that the chemistry and dynamic on stage wasn’t what we were hoping it would be,” Mr. Zeiger said in a telephone interview. “We were looking for something slightly different from what we were gettingand it took watching it from start to finish to see that.”

Mr. Kushnier had initially auditioned for the rolebut didn’t get it. He is now performing Off Broadway in “Shear Madness,” but will leave that production join the Cirque productionMr. Zeiger said.

He said “Paramour,” which combines acrobatics with theatrical storytelling to depict a love triangle between the film producera writerand an actresswould maintain its planned schedulebeginning previews on April 16 and opening on May 25 at the Lyric Theater.

President de Gaulle's proposal came at the end of a rambling 92‐minute news conference in the Elysee Palace. His audience totaled 1,000including French Cabinet ministers and reporters.

The generalwho is 73 years oldseemed older and more tired as he took his seat beneath glaring lights. He hardly glanced at the Cabinetwhich sat at his right. Although his sentences were as rounded as everhis choice of words as precisesome of the old vigor appeared to be missing.

The impression that he had aged rapidly in the last six months was linked by many to his refusalgood‐natured but definiteto say whether he would be a candidate for reelection.

The news conference in the Salle des Fetes began with a weighty discourse on the advantages of the French Constitutionwhich will be six years old next October. He took a poor view of the 175year‐old American constitutional system.

Milne poemsand bathing and feeding her. After Jane’s bedtimeI returned to the law books with renewed will. Each part of my life provided respite from the other and gave me a sense of proportion that classmates trained only on law studies lacked.

I have had more than a little bit of luck in lifebut nothing equals in magnitude my marriage to Martin D. Ginsburg. I do not have words adequate to describe my supersmartexuberantever-loving spouse. Early on in our marriageit became clear to him that cooking was not my strong suit. To the eternal appreciation of our food-loving children (we became four in 1965when our sonJameswas born)Marty made the kitchen his domain and became chef supreme in our home.

Marty coached me through the birth of our sonhe was the first reader and critic of articlesspeeches and briefs I draftedand he was at my side constantlyin and out of the hospitalduring two long bouts with cancer. And I betray no secret in reporting thatwithout himI would not have gained a seat on the Supreme Court.

Ron Klainthen associate White House counselsaid of my 1993 nomination: “I would say definitely and for the recordthough Ruth Bader Ginsburg should have been picked for the Supreme Court anywayshe would not have been picked for the Supreme Court if her husband had not done everything he did to make it happen.”

That “everything” included gaining the unqualified support of my home state senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and enlisting the aid of many members of the legal academy and practicing bar familiar with work I had done.

I have several times said that the office I holdnow for more than 23 yearsis the best and most consuming job a lawyer anywhere could have.

The court’s main trust is to repair fractures in federal law. Because the court grants review dominantly when other jurists have divided on the meaning of a statutory or constitutional prescriptionthe questions we take up are rarely easy; they seldom have indubitably right answers. Yet by reasoning together at our conferences andwith more depth and precisionthrough circulation ofand responses todraft opinionswe ultimately agree far more often than we divide sharply.

 7418,  1964, a, TO THE EDITOR:

I applaud Dr. Foster's suggestion that we reevaluate our physical fitness programsbut I am concerned that the casual reader will conclude that now he can with good stop exercising. This is not so. We cannot stop moving because to live is to move. Let us learn to do it as efficiently and lly as possible and at the same time learn to conserve the human body.

Womenwhom Dr. Foster dismissed in a brief two‐sentence paragraphhave probably come closer to realizing this than men. Women know that the shape given to them by nature must be carefully cultivated throughout the years and that the only way this can really be done is through proper diet and effective g. As a result of gthey sense a greater feeling of well‐being and remain younger‐in looks and in feeling.

One element of aging is loss of flexibility. Regain and increase that element and a great deal has been achieved. Could all this have something to do with women outliving men ?
 5325,  1988, a, Two Palestinians were killed today as Israeli troops and a Jewish settler opened fire on stone-throwing youths in Hebronin the West BankPalestinians said.

An army spokesman said the circumstances of the kilings were unclear. ''There are five wounded and we are speaking of one or two killed,'' the spokesman saidadding that the army was investigating the shootings.

Eight Palestinians have been killed in the last week by Israeli soldiers using live ammunition and plastic bullets to quash unrest in the occupied territories. Early this weekDefense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said the plastic bullets were nonlethal and were meant to injurenot to kill. He said he hoped that an increase in injuries would discourage Palestinian protests.

But there was a surge in the number of deaths this weekwhen the plastic bullets were first put into useand the United States has protested. Palestinians say at least 100 people have been wounded by the plastic ammunition.

 3479,  1999, a, ''I do think it's true that future generations are going to find themselves making decisions about the allocation of long-term assets that were once made by state or corporate pension schemes,'' said Michael Morleya Merrill Lynch private client specialist.

The American invasion has added to the competitive pressures on Britain's own fractured investment fraternitywhich is heavily concentrated in Londonand which has traditionally carved up the market between high-ticket stockbrokersindependent financial advisers selling pensions and insurance and a range of fund managers. In recent yearssome of Britain's best-known private client stockbrokers have been forced into mergers and that trend may well continue. ''We expect a lot more changea lot more consolidation,'' said Mr. Taylor at Merrill Lynch.

There is plenty at stake. More than 4 million Britons have financial assets -- pension fundsbank deposits and investments -- worth more than $80,000 andof those1.4 million have assets of between $160,000 and $800,000making Britain the world's fifth biggest personal financial services marketaccording to a Merrill Lynch study released last year and based on 1997 figures. By the end of 1997this report saidBritain's private investors controlled assets -- including offshore investments -- of more than $1 trillion.

The Edward Jones approachof courseis distinctive in Britainstressing a Main Street presence and local contacts made from a one-person officewhere advice is free and revenues come from commission fees and transaction charges.

Steve Jonesan American pioneer who opened an Edward Jones outlet in Sevenoaks last yearcame from a similar operation in Wake ForestN.C.and established himself in Britainhe saidby ''walking up and down the street''seeking out the nameplates of accountants and solicitors for his client list.

Mr. Benarroch's own operation on Finchley Road in Golders Green is sandwiched between Diva's Italian restaurant and Co Co's Fitness Center. But while Co Co's offers ''rapid inch loss'' and ''the ultimate relaxing experience,'' Mr. Benarroch is hooked up by satellite and computer to the markets and is set to offer ''buy-and-hold'' investmentsprimarily in British equitiesfor the long haul. ''Some people come in wanting to make a quick fortune and we say they are not the people for us,'' Mr. Benarroch said.

If Britons resent the American approachthey are not saying so. ''As a womanyesit appeals to me because I feel comfortable coming into a place like this,'' said Susan Mindelwho runs a mail-order business in photographic supplies. Mr. Benarroch even won the endorsement of one representative of the British establishmentLord Jeffrey Archerwho traveled to Golders Green to inaugurate the office andtherebypress his campaign for London's mayoral elections next year. Pointedlyhe noted that the American company said it was no fly-by-night. ''Those are the ones we like,'' he said.

 2979,  2002, a, Flaws in the F.B.I.'s handling of the Zacarias Moussaoui case before Sept. 11 are prompting Congressional leaders and the Bush administration to try to make it easier for the government to obtain secret wiretaps and search warrants to investigate foreigners suspected of involvement in terrorist plots.

At a Congressional hearing todaylawyers for the Justice DepartmentFederal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency all expressed support for legislation in the Senate that would lower the standards of evidence required to obtain court approval for secret wiretaps in investigations of foreign terrorists and spies.

Under the rules in use last summerF.B.I. officials did not believe they had enough evidence against Mr. Moussaoui before Sept. 11 to prove that he was an agent of a foreign power or had connections to an international terrorist group. He now faces trial in federal courtaccused of being the 20th hijacker.

Under the legislationsponsored by Senator Charles E. SchumerDemocrat of New Yorkand Senator Jon KylRepublican of Arizonathe Justice Department would no longer have to convince a special court that a suspect was an agent of a foreign power or a member of an international terrorist organization to obtain a wiretap under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

LOS ANGELES — A crowd of finance-starved filmmakers wanted to know where the money was.

They were at a symposium on state-sponsored incentives for film production at the Landmark Theater here on Fridayand the news was mostly bad.

Iowa’s subsidy program has collapsed in the face of a criminal investigation. New Jersey’s is suspended. California spent its $100 million yearly allotment of tax credits in one day.

But there is new money on the wayinsisted Schuyler Moorea veteran film lawyer with the firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavanwho spoke to fellow panelists at the symposiumorganized by the Incentives Office consulting firm.

From where?

Mr. Moore said. “It’s absolutely coming.”

Less comforting was Mr. Moore’s assurance that Chinese film investors would be looking not so much for monetary return as cultural influence.

The keyhe saidis to “find a project that portrays their culture in a positive light.”

Roland Emmerich’s “2012,” backed by the Japanese-owned Sony Corporation and shot in Los Angeles and Canadashowed how a Hollywood film could give China a boostMr. Moore said.

In that oneas much of the planet was being destroyed by tidal wavesChina saved the day with a bunch of ingeniously built arks — and the film was a blockbuster in Beijing.

If Chinese plot lines don’t appealMr. Moore suggested that producers keep an eye on the trading in box-office futuresa proposed practice that was ostensibly banned by the federal government’s financial reform act.

“There’s a way through that,” said Mr. Moorewho did not trace the exact path.

Society news was a longstanding feature of the European edition. Reports on the high society of capital cities often filled several pages. Stationed at popular resorts during the holiday seasonthe Herald’s reporters told colorful tales of elegant festivities and sporting events.

While mostly frivolous by naturethe society columns reveal interesting facets of social change. In February 1909for examplethe Herald’s correspondent told of “the roller-skating craze” that has “spread all over London from Whitechapel to Mayfair.”



“Everybody seems to have gone ‘rinking’ mad from duchesses to costers. Dozens of rinks have sprung into being like mushroomsbut the biggest and most important is in the enormous structure called Olympiamade famous years ago by Barnum and Bailey’s circus.”

The story ran under pictures of high society figuresand contained the usual list of patrons“prominent either by their titles or because they are theatrical celebrities.” But the writer picked up on a new phenomenon:

“It is interesting to see how democratic English people can be when they are victims of a fad. At these rinks grand ladies and shopgirls are all on the same levelboth socially and physicallyas they glide around. You can’t tell them apart.”

On the rink there might have been no constraint or embarrassmentbut it would probably have been a very different story if the “grand ladies and shopgirls” had met in a ballroom…

 6234,  1973, a, WASHINGTONFeb. 1 —North Vietnam turned over to the United States in Paris today the names of nine American prisoners — seven servicemen and two civilians—held by Communist forces in Laos. The list also included the name of a Canadian civilian.

American officials were privately disappointed by the list since they had hoped that it would contain a substantial number of the 311 servicemen whom the Defense Department had reported missing and the 6 men carried as prisoners in Laos. Officials emphasized that the United States would be seeking clarification on the status of men believed captured or missing.

The provision of the prisoner list for Laos removed one procedural hitch that had developed in the prisoner‐exchange program under the Vietnam cease‐fire agreement that was signed Saturdayand it presumably cleared the way for release of the prisonersprobably starting next week.

When the Communist side supplied information Saturday on prisoners it heldthe lists—to the surprise of American ofoped in the prisoner‐exchange program under the Vietnam cease‐fire agreement that was signed Saturdayand it presumably cleared the way for release of the prisonersprobably starting next week.

John V. Lindsay often delivered homespun advice to ordinary constituentsand Edward I. Koch claims to have answered every letter or e-mail he has received. But a century agofew elected officials were more prolific or perspicacious in their correspondence than William J. Gaynorwho became New York City’s mayor 103 years ago on Tuesdayand served until 1913.

A biographerLately Thomaswrote that Mayor Gaynor’s “means of communicating with the mass of the people were two: the daily newspapers and the United States mails,” and that he spent a considerable amount of his workdays personally answering his constituents. One critic even complained that the mayorwho wrote thousands of his letters in officeconducted “government by epistle.”

In sheer numbersprobably no mayor except Mr. Koch came close. And Mayor Gaynor’s letters were distinguished by frequent references to philosophers and other learned figures whom he had encountered during his early religious training.

His candorsagacityvigorous defense of civil liberties and fierce independence (and his scrapping of the East River bridge tolls) endeared him to his constituents. In 1910his shooting by a fired city employee prompted such an outpouring of sympathy that he was briefly mentioned for governor and even president. (Mayor Gaynor died three years later of complications from the wound.)

A former seminary student and State Supreme Court justicehe was nominated for mayor by the regular Democratic organizationbut governed independently and was described as a liberal with libertarian leanings.

His inauguration as mayor on Jan. 11910was his first visit to City Hall. From then onhe routinely walked across the Brooklyn Bridge between his office and his home in Park SlopeBrooklyn. He often coupled common sense with Greek philosophywhichhe wrote“seemed to astonish the whole journalistic fraternity in New York City.”

No less a cynic than H.L. Mencken pronounced Mayor Gaynor a “great political philosopher and a great soul” who “began an heroic but vain effort to give New York decent government.”

The mayor dictated his lettersmany of which survive as typed copies in the municipal archives. No subject was too small; he once delivered a lengthy exposition on how to boil an egg.

Mayor Gaynor dismissed critics with sarcasm. Accusing a Republican politician of lyinghe wrote“Suppose you pray every morning for a while for God to direct you to tell the truthand see what fruits it will bear.”

When Charles M. Freyan erudite rat catchercomplained that his livelihood was threatened by repeated calls to jury dutythe mayor suggested that rat catchers be exemptcautioningthoughthat “so many exemptions have already been passed by the Legislature that there seems to be only the rat catchers and a few other people left to serve on juries.”

To a solicitation for a $10 contribution from the Anti-Saloon LeagueGaynor wrote: “If I gave money in response to all the similar demands that are made on meI should be bankrupt in short order.”

When a Christian minister asked for a license to preach conversion in predominantly Jewish neighborhoods of Brooklynthe mayor responded“Did not we Christians get much or the most of what we have from the Jews?’’

When city aldermen proposed banning the Socialist’s red flagGaynor lectured“They chose the color red for their emblemnot to signify that they favor violence or the shedding of bloodas the unintelligent suppose and as actions of those in official authority often lead people to believebut for the purposes of typifying the common brotherhood of all men of all nations through the same red blood which flows through the veins of all.’’

Constituents frequently groused about noise. To one who was irked by the cries of newsboysGaynor wrote“A whole lot of people have been hollering at me of latebut they do not disturb meand much less does the hollering of the little newsboys disturb me.”

To another who worked in the Flatiron Building near a church presided over by his nemesisthe Rev. Charles H. Parkhurstand who complained that the clock on the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower chimed 40 times an hourhe wrote: “But reallydoes the clock make as much noise as Dr. Parkhurst does? You know we all have to bear with somethingand I am willing to do my share of it.”

When a Manhattan lawyer demanded that piano playing and singing be banned at nightespecially during the summer when people open their windowsthe mayor advised: “I hereby authorize you to carry out all of these reforms. It may be that you will first have to get elected to the Legislatureand pass laws thereforfor you know this is a government of lawsand not of men.”

He championed children’s street gamesadvising one young man who wrote him“If you show this letter to the policemanI think he will let you play with a soft rubber ball on 101st Street between Lexington and Park Avenues if you ask him and if you are careful not to hit other people.”

To a correspondent who grumbled that aldermen were extorting a fee to preside over marriageshe wrote“if I had time I would marry you all for nothing.”

His reply to a Chicago woman reads like advice to the lovelorn: “You are looking for happiness in the wrong direction. I do not think there is any man living who would suit you. If you want to be really happy for the rest of your lifework for the happiness of othersand forget yourself.”

Gaynor was not easily impressed. Responding to a book by the pastor of a Park Slope churchhe wrote that the Emancipation Proclamation “had to be almost extorted” from President Abraham Lincoln“and the Russian emperor had done the like not long before.”

Of George WashingtonGaynor wrote that he was “of warm blood and prone to passion,” that he was “even known to have sworn like a trooper at times,” that his “face was pitted” and that he “was not the equal in knowledge of historyeconomics and government of the men who surrounded him.”

Many of the letters were answered the same day they were received. Form letters were dismissed. Anonymous ones were often answered in the press. “You are evidently a dishonest scampbut I acknowledge the receipt of all letters,” he wrote one correspondent.

And to the National Publicity Bureauwhich asked what message he would deliver to readers of the group’s 3,000-member newspapersthe mayor replied“I would say to them to be very careful about believing all they see in the newspapers.”

The cause was complications from alcoholismaccording to a report from the Milwaukee medical examiner's office.

Mr. Katz's programPKZipplayed a major role in making Internet communications faster and less expensive. The zip file archive he developed compresses information so that it takes up less space on a disk drive and less time is needed to download it from the Web or send it to another computer.

 4381,  1994, a, A Premiere of Rorem Songs Turns Out to Be Chamber Music Alice Tully Hall

The premiere of Ned Rorem's "Songs of Sadness" had its proper setting on Sunday evening. At first glance eight songs with accompanimentthis was really chamber music as played by the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. In Mr. Rorem's brief cycleguitarclarinet and cello areif not equal partnersat least important friends to the vocal part.

In "How Can I Sing," flurries of arpeggios from the clarinet offer back-and-forth dialogue with the singer's leaping intervals. "A Vision of the Garden" is vigorous syncopation. In "StrikeChurl," a bleak wind blows in chromatic movement. A long cello solo introduces "A Mother's Lament."

Two of the songs are gentle danceswhile "Binsley Poplars" matches the gray despair and inner rhythms of Gerard Manley Hopkins's text. The songs are bound togethersometimes by solo interludes. Kurt Ollmann was the excellent baritoneDavid Shifrin the clarinetistSharon Isbin the guitarist and Fred Sherry the cellist.

There was other music: a Trio Sonata in E by C. P. E. Bachstrangely soporific for such a volatile composer; Gounod's delightful "Petite Symphonie" for nine windsin which the organ-grinder's art is raised to new esthetic heightsand finally Mozart's dark and precisely played C-minor Serenade.

 4548,  1993, a, Daniel H. Majeskethe concertmaster of the Cleveland Orchestra since 1969died on Sunday at his home in EuclidOhio. He was 61.

The cause was prostate cancersaid NancyBell Coethe orchestra's manager.

Mr. Majeske was born in Detroit in 1932 and made his orchestral debut with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra when he was 16. After studying with Ivan Galamian at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphiahe joined the United States Navy Band in Washington in 1951.

During his four years in the Navy BandMr. Majeske also studied theology with the intention of becoming a minister. But he also wrote to George Szellthe music director of the Cleveland Orchestraseeking an audition. Szell offered him a seat in the orchestra's first violin section. Mr. Majeske became the orchestra's assistant concertmaster in 1959 and its associate concertmaster in 1967. A Turning Point

When Rafael Druian abruptly resigned hours before a recording session for the Brahms Double Concerto in 1969Mr. Majeske performed the solo violin line. Szell appointed him concertmaster the next day. He performed as a soloist with the orchestra more than 100 timesand his performance of the Martinu Concerto last April was recorded by London Records for release next year. He is also the violin soloist on the orchestra's recordings of Richard Strauss's "Also Sprach Zarathustra" and "Heldenleben" and Rimsky-Korsakov's "Scheherezade."

TOOTH ALIGNMENTS MAY BE INHERITED; Two Scientists Offer Theory at 91st Session of American Dental Association CITE PATTERN IN FAMILIES Thumb-Sucking and the Other Local Factors Are Almost Eliminated as a Cause
 6324,  1970, a, BUFFALOJan. 2 (AP)— Seven patrol cars cruised throughout Erie County to day looking for motor vehicles that were polluting the air. Inspectors reported spotting 41 of them.

 4505,  1993, a, I thoroughly enjoyed your articlewith one exception -- the family portrait of John Eberhardt and his "adopted son and lover." My attitude has always been live and let livebut the words "adopted son and lover" denote an unhealthy relationship -- dare I say incest?

 1153,  2012, a, Savvy politicians know that it’s usually a good sign when a political advertisement provokes cries of outrage from the opposition. The picture gets murkierthoughwhen that same advertisement prompts high-minded expressions of disappointment from the politician’s own supporters. Sometimes that’s a signal that the ad in question has overreached and risks a backlash. But sometimes it’s just a sign that those high-minded supporters don’t recognize the weakness that the ad is trying to exploitor just don’t have the stomach for a necessary fight.

This is the dilemma the Obama re-election campaign faces with the ad it released recently suggesting that Mitt Romney might not have given the order to send Navy SEALS to kill Osama Bin Laden. The attack clearly touched a nerve with Republicansbut it also earned the White House a rebuke from several liberalsincluding no less a left-wing eminence than Arianna Huffington.

On the Early Show on CBSHuffington called the ad “despicable,” suggested that questioning an opponent’s ability to serve as commander-in-chief is “not the way to run campaigns on either side,” and compared the attack to the “3 A.M. phone call” ad Hillary Clinton’s campaign released in 2008which made a similar case against then-candidate Obama’s ability to make the toughest national security decisions.

When even Huffington thinks a Democratic attack goes too farit usually has. And yet a moment’s scrutiny reveals that her argument doesn’t make much sense. Why do we have election seasonsafter allif not to argue about which candidate would be better-suited to making decisions that put Americans in harm’s way overseas? How can we not politicize national securitygiven how central it is to the work of the modern presidencyand how unconstrained the executive branch’s national security powers have become no matter which party holds the White House?

These are the arguments that Hillary Clinton partisans mounted in defense of that “3 A.M. ad,” and that George W. Bush’s partisans mounted in defense of his 9/11-centric 2004 re-election campaign. And those arguments were right! It’s one thing to say that candidates shouldn’t impugn one another’s patriotism. But impugning a rival’s judgmentas the Obama camp’s Bin Laden advertisement just didis precisely what a presidential campaign is for.

Strategicallytoothe White House has every reason to press these kind of arguments to the hilt. As I’ve noted in this space beforemost of President Obama’s record is unpopular – sometimes deeply so – with the voting public. But the big exception is national securitywhere polls often show that Obama has built up a fair amount of credibility with voters. Foreign policy thus offers the White House its best (and perhaps only) opportunity to draw contrasts with Romney by highlighting the president’s actual accomplishments.

Whereas on domestic issues the Romney camp can answer almost every Obama attack by changing the subject to the unemployment rateon foreign policy the Republican message is much more muddled and uncertain. In the usual order of thingsRomney would be simply try to out-hawk the presidentbut this is not a hawkish moment in American politics. Outside of the most Republican portions of the electoratethe Iraq War is still widely regarded as a bad blunderand even conservatives are increasingly supportive of a speedy exit from Afghanistan. Public opinion on Iran is unsettledbut there is next to no support for the kind of stepped-up American intervention in Syria that some Republicans have championed.

Meanwhileby keeping much of the Bush-era anti-terror architecture in place and stepping up covert warfare from Waziristan to the Horn of Africathe president has effectively undercut the soft-on-terror arguments that Republicans used so effectively against John Kerry in 2004. Indeedthe most compelling criticisms of this White House have come from libertarians and anti-interventionists on both the left and righton issues ranging from the dubiously-legal “kinetic military action” in Libya to the White House’s willingness to order the assassination of an American citizen abroad.

This explains why the Republican Party’s foreign policy rhetoric can seem so opportunistic and confused. The Rand Paul-ledanti-interventionist wing of the party arguably has a more coherent case against the president than the more hawkish wingwhich often finds itself emphasizing what it has in common with the president – as Florida Senator Marco Rubio did in a widely-touted foreign policy address defending interventionism last week. (Tellinglythe word “Iraq” did not appear in his remarks.) Yet the hawkish line of attack is still the Republican defaultand Mitt Romney’s case — to dateat least — against the president has generally circled back to its tropes and premises.

The result is an incoherence that James Poulos described well in a recent column in Forbes:

With Obamathe GOP has become like Woody Allen’s neurotic diner: the food is horribleand such small portions! The president is condemned for leading and for leading from behind; for relying too much on talk and too much on drones; for slavishly kowtowing to foreign leaders and for arrogantly refusing to stroke foreign leaders. Obama’s foreign policy has paralyzed the GOP by laying bare just how much Republicans collectively refuse to fully commit to one grandunifying possibility in international affairs — including the possibility of stepping away from sweeping principles and playing it by ear for a while.

Arianna Huffington’s qualms notwithstandingit would be political malpractice for the president not to exploit this kind of confusion with national security attacks on his opponent. IndeedRepublicans who care about these issues should welcome them. Advertisements like the Bin Laden spot and political stunts like last night’s almost-victory speech in Afghanistan present a challenge to the rightbut also an opportunity.

The rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign affords conservatives their best chance yet to come to terms with the Bush era in foreign policy and its aftermath — to figure out what they think about the recent pastwhere they stand at present and where they would have the country go from here.

 3088,  2001, a, OF coursepart of the trans-Atlantic distinction lies in the deep cultural divide in attitudes toward success. In the United Statessuccess stands as a beacon to the ambitious of what can be attained -- an outlook that appears to justify the kind of one-time windfall bonuses that bloat some American executive pay deals. In Europejust as oftensuccess breeds resentment.

That is one reasondespite moves toward more openness about corporate accountsthat individual salariesbonuses and other perquisites are simply not disclosed in much of continental Europe. When Göran Lindahlthen chief executive of ABBthe Zurich-based engineering giantwas asked in an interview how much he earnedhe declined to answer. Mr. Lindahl said he would provide a figure only when the company moved to American accounting rules -- that iswhen required to do so.

In Germanytooonly the total amount of basic salary paid to an entire board of directors is routinely disclosed to shareholders. Individual amounts are not given.

The executives' reticence is related to two aspects of the German mentalitysaid Ms. Bergdoltthe shareholder activist in Munich. ''We are not so open as Americans are about our salaries,'' she said in a telephone interview. ''At homeeven the children don't know what the father earns. And we have a stronger envy complex. In the U.S.A.if you earn a lotyou show it. In Germanypeople don't show how much they earn because we are quicker to envy.''

That could also be said of Britainwhere the salaries of senior executives at the country's top 100 companies rose by an average of 20.4 percent last yearto around $1 millionaccording to New Bridge Streeta consulting firm in London. While that total is only about one-twelfth of the annual packages for the most successful American executivesthe percentage increase far outstripped the national average pay gain of about 4 percent.

Another consulting firmTowers Perrinsaid Britain's chief executives were paid 24 times the average manufacturing salary -- the highest multiple in Europe -- compared with 15 in Germany and 13 in Sweden. The average American chief executive made 475 times as much as the average blue-collar worker in 1999according to the A.F.L.-C.I.O.

Britain has twice sought to tighten rules on executive pay. A commission led by Lord Cadbury in 1992 urged the creation of compensation committees made up of independent nonexecutive directors. Anotherunder Sir Richard Greenburythe former chairman of the retailer Marks & Spencerproposed the principle that bonuses be linked to performance over several years. The results have been ambiguous.
 1095,  2012, a, Four of the Republican presidential candidates actively campaigned in Iowa on Sundaytwo days before the state’s caucuses. This is what they were saying:

In Iowa Reporting on candidates and voters from the Hawkeye State.

Mitt Romney in Atlantic:

“I’ll let people make their own assessment of our respective recordsbut I’m a conservative.”

“I’m proud to be a conservative businessmanand what distinguishes me I think from others in the field is that I understand the economy first-hand having lived in it.”

“And I think that the people of this country recognize that with our economy as the major issue we face right nowthat it would be helpful to have someone who understands the economy first-handwho spent the bulk of his career working in the private sector.”

Newt Gingrich was in Marshalltownwhere he talked about his opponents Rick SantorumGov. Rick Perry of TexasMr. Romney and Representative Michele Bachmann:

“If you count Santorum and Perry and Bachmann and mecompared to the Romney numbersit’s going to be overwhelming that the conservative base of the party is still there and that Governor Romney remains basically a Massachusetts moderate. He has not broken out despite spending millions of dollarsand as we go on in New Hampshire and South Carolina and Floridathose numbers will ultimately prove decisive in the race.”

“I think New Hampshire is the perfect state to have a debate over Romneycare and a debate about tax-paid abortionswhich he signed.”

Mr. Santorum talking to supporters in Sioux City:

“This is the most important election in our lifetime. This is a decision as to what kind of America you are going to hand to your children and grandchildren. Are you going to leave an America that is more and more dependent on bigger and bigger government to do the things families and churches and local communities should do?”

Representative Michele Bachmann in Oskaloosa:

“Who stands for marriage between a man and a woman? Who stands for life and the protection of human life from conception to natural deathnot just to be politically popularbut who really means it? And who’s going to do something about it?”

“I am not a politician. I am not an establishment person. I am a real authentic Iowan.”

“I believe I’m the best person to take on Barack Obama and defeat him.”
 3677,  1998, a, Frankie Andreu said before the start of the Tour de France's 19th stage today that his legs were dead and that there was no point in expecting him to join a largeearly breakaway.

No wayhe said. No legs.

Andreuan American rider for the United States Postal Service teamsounded convincing even though his goal in this Tourhis seventhwas identical with his goal in the first six: get in a good breakaway and win a stage. It had not happened yetand there were only three days to go before the finish in Paris on Sunday.

A breakaway was expected by nearly all of the 96 riders left because the journey from La Chaux- de-Fonds in Switzerland to Autun in France measured 150 miles and most teams with top sprinterslike Mapei and Telekomsaid that they were too tired to lead a long chase for a chance at a mass rush to the finish.

With only 14 of the original 21 teams left after the withdrawal of the last five TVM riders this morning and at least four teams intent on a restful daythe road was open to an early acceleration.

“How anyone can look at 314 as a desirable solution is beyond me,” says Bruce Lippkeeconomist for the Weyerhaeuser Corporationthe Northwest's giant forest products company. “Yet it's the first chance people have had to kick back. They're fed up with no help for the schools from the legislature and this is one way to vent their anger.

“We are against it. But the initiative will probably pass because people are mad—and uninformed about the real consequences.”

Then he adds: “Our investments could be reduced as much as 20 per centdepending on our cash flow.”

Foes of the measure also say that the tax is “regressive” because corporations who do in ‐ state businesssuch as grocery and retail storeswill increase their prices andin effectconsumers will pay the tax. They also contend that the tax will not cure the school illsas the measure will raise only half of current school requests and will not totally replace future school levies.

Also receiving attention is the impact the tax would have on the flow of out‐of‐state investment funds; Initiative 314 applies a compensating tax to earnings of out‐of‐state corporations investing in Washington. Mortgage officials estimate that 50 to 70 per cent of funds for its industry come from out of statemainly the Eastand they say the tax could shut off that money.

Gov. Daniel Evans has been quoted as having said the initiative contains a bombshell that has been little noticed—its effect on municipal‐bond interest rates. Such bonds are taxexempt under the Federal regulationsbut Initiative 314 would tax such interest.

On a $100‐million bond issuethe interest rate might be about 6 per cent. But under 314one bond expert said any corporate buyers of the bonds would be required to pay the 12 per cent tax on the interest. Thusthey would demand higher interest rate to purchase themperhaps 6.8 per cent. Taxpayers would pick up the extra costwhich could run into millions.

 2015,  2007, a, Lara Stone isn’t your typical runway android. She walks like Lurch and you can’t tell from her stunned expression if she’s going to burst into tears or belt you in the chops. But we love her. She’s 23Dutchand she has a little gap between her front teeth.

“They say in French that it’s good luck,” Stone told me last night in the Givenchy backstage. She’s had a lucky year. Overlooked until Riccardo Tisci put her in his Givenchy couture showsStone has a big Bardot-like spread in this month’s Paris Vogue; she gets the cover (in Chloé) for April. “Sometimes a girl just touches you,” Carine Roitfeldthe magazine’s editorsaid. As for Stone’s awkward gaitthe explanation is almost too dopey for words. She wears a size 7 shoe — and runway shoes are at least a size larger. “They made me my own special shoes,” Stone said at Givenchy. “I’m so happy.”

I asked the photographer Greg Kessler to keep a record of Stone: one girlone season. Here she is in every show since New York.

 3696,  1998, a, In a back-to-school gift to shoppers and retailersthe fourth tax-free shopping week in the last two years begins today in New York Statewith state sales taxes eliminated on all clothing and shoes costing less than $500.

New York City has suspended its own tax as wellmeaning that through next Mondaycity shoppers will not have to pay the normal 8.25 percent in sales tax on most types of apparel. The reprieve is intended in part to keep shoppers from taking their business elsewhereas lower-tax states like New Jersey have often drawn people at peak shopping times like the holidays and before the opening of school.

Some retailers are worriedhoweverthat the recent turmoil on Wall Street and other factors may undermine the impact of this week's tax cut.

''During past tax-free shopping weeksUnited Colors of Benetton stores citywide saw a dramatic surge in sales,'' said Carlo Tunioligeneral manager of Benetton U.S.A. ''Howeverthis tax-free shopping week may be impacted by the recent instability in the financial markets and the unrelenting hot weathermaking customers reluctant to shop and thereby affecting a normally profitable sales period.''

 6219,  1973, a, Most of the programs that the commission recommended had been proposed beforeat least in basic form. Thus the creation of a merged “Superior Court” was suggested by another state group in the midnineteen‐sixties. And the idea of a centralized court administration to replace the present Administrative Board has been suggested numerous times.

The suggestion that the state pay all costs of the courts has been made by Mayor Lindsay and by Chief Judge Stanley H. Fuld and others.

Though no state has yet done away with the bail systemdifferent aspects of reform have been broached by various groups here. According to the commissiona judge should either release a defendant on his own recognizance or release him subject to certain conditions and supervision—the supervision to be provided by an expanded Probation Department. And if a defendant has previously failed to meet court dateor where the charge is a felonythe judge should be allowed to detain the defendant if it thinks that detention is needed to ensure the defendant's appearance for trial. He would have to give his reasonsin writingfor thinking this.

The commission's plan for judicial discipline—the creation of a full‐time staffed commission to investigate complaints about judges—has also been suggested before andin factis modeled after the California system.

But the commission proposal adds some refinements that. according to Mr. Jerry would make New York's system the “strictest in the land.” The commission could censure judges. If it wanted a judge retired or removed it would refer the case to the Court on the Judiciary whichunder the commission planwould be made a permanent court. The court now is convened by the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals only after documented complaints have been lodged.

Nearly all of the commission's proposals require constitutional amendments and some also require subsequent legislation.

In an effort to help get its proposals passed —in a year when many othersincluding the Governor and Mayor Lindsayare also planning courtreform packages to the Legislature—the commission included in its report a full volume of proposed constitutional and statutory amendments.

 2007,  2007, a, Did I write last week’s column simply to provoke you?

The answerof courseis nothough for a moment this week I found myself seriously wondering about itas I re-read all your comments – 83 pages worth – in one long sitting.

The question wasn’t unreasonable. I hadafter allwritten my account of Rebecca Riley’s death with a particular straw person in mind: someone who would generalize from her story to say that it was emblematic of what was happening in a sick society where kids are being medicated to shut them upmake parents happyand assure doctors of “quick fix” solutions to cultural ills that no one has any desire to cure.

Why did I seek to take that particular straw person on? And how did I know what he or she would be thinking?

It’s very simple: that person used to be me.

Some of you may perhaps recall that I used to sing a very different tune on the whole business of diagnosing and medicating children. It’s a topic I’ve come back to with some regularitybecause as some of you knowI’ve been trying for the past three years to write a book on the mystery of why so many kids are being diagnosed with so many issues.

My book was initially supposed to be a kind of social reading of the culture of pathology in our time. You know what I mean: this world of A.D.D. and O.D.D. and G.A.D. and O.C.D. and P.D.D.* and bipolar disorder that has replaced the world of playground fights and bloody noses and kids sitting on the floor in the hallway after they’ve been kicked out of class that we all recall from our childhood. I was supposed to deconstruct this world – of “affluent parents and neurotic kids” as my contract put it – taking on “the overanalyzingthe overperfectingthe overpathologizing of America’s children” and raising questions “about the way an anxious culture reproduces itself.”

Some of you may find all this questionable. Even offensive. Parents of kids with “issues” generally do. In factwhen I was starting out with the booka fair number of peopleincluding good friends of mine whose children suffer from emotionalbehaviorallearning or developmental difficultiesfound my attitude – and my early postings here on the subject – just plain mean.

I didn’t see what was mean about them. I didn’t see what was offensive or objectionableor even particularly opinionated. After allthere had been no end to the news stories bringing to light how the drug companies manipulate and mislead consumers. There was no refuting the fact that the field of research psychiatrywith its dependence upon Big Pharma for research grantswas profoundly corrupted. There was no question that doctorspressured by managed-care companies and the demands of their own bottom linewere dispensing too many meds in too little timeasking too few questionsand providing parents and kids with too few real answers. I didn’t see what was debatable about the notion that kids were by and large being overdiagnosed and overmedicated; that doctors and parents and teachers and schools were taking the easy way out; and that all were turning a collective blind eye to the pathological aspects of our culture that were showing up as symptoms in our kids. It seemed obvious to me that our children were truly the canaries in the coal mine for our sick culture and that we were drugging themin large partto neutralize their cries for help and to “help” them more efficiently get with the program. That was what I set out to write about.

Most of you probably find that point of view appealing. Much more appealingperhapsthan what I’ve been saying in recent weeks. But you seethere was a problem. That original booktentatively titled “We’ve Got Issues: Childhood in the Age of Anxiety,” never got written.

For a long time I thought that it wasn’t getting written because I was too busy or too lazy or too scatterbrained to write it. But then I realized that it wasn’t getting written because it simply couldn’t be written. Its central argument was a tenable one in theorybut it crumbled in practicewhen I ventured further than reading books and newspaper and magazine articlesand got beyond theory and started to talk to real people. To real parents who consistently told stories of how they’d painfully accepted labels and medications for their kids only after exhausting every other possible optionand to practitioners who often enough had themselves approached the whole issue of “flavor of the month” diagnoses like attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder with skepticismbut had then come to see their validity – and the value of properly prescribed medication – from the weight of evidence they’d amassed in clinical practice.

I became awareover timethat there was a name for people like me within the community of parents and doctors whose lives were consumed with treating children with A.D.H.D. and other issues: “naysayers.” I learned that we – the people who had no idea what it was like to parent a child with serious issues but found it easy to theorize and moralize and pontificate about the “abstract other” – were just one more burden that these parents and their children had to contend with in their already overburdened lives.

Do you know what life is like for parents whose children end up on medication? It’s not filled with annoyance because troublesome Junior has come along to wreck your years of childless fun. It’s filled with things like having your 6-year-old beg you to push him in front of a truck because he doesn’t want to live anymore. Or having your 8-year-old cry while she struggles through her homeworkbecause her “brain is broken.” Or having your lovely 9-year-old start to do things like dump a plate of food on her head in the school cafeteria becausewellbecause everyone already thinks she’s the “weird kid” anyway. Parents who medicate have kids whose “antics” sometimes require calls to 911. For self-protection. Parents – most parents – who end up choosing to medicate do so because their kids are in serious pain.

NowI’m not naïve. It is obvious that overdiagnosis and overmedication exist. Every doctor I’ve spoken with – even those who are most aggressive in wanting to raise awareness of disorders like A.D.H.D. and bipolar illness in kids – has said so. The practice of direct-to-consumer marketing is a scandal that has made serious mental illnesses banal and created an easyovereager and underscrutinized market for serious drugs. And I do think that a certain portion of what is sometimes labeled as pathology in children can be attributed to poor parentingpoor schools and the pathological levels of stress and pressure that kids (and adults) now experience.

We live in a depressinganxious-making and frenzied era; it’s no surprise that signs of depressionanxiety and overwhelmed distractibility are so widespread. But there’s a difference between people who exhibit these signs of distress under certain conditions and those who show consistent signs of disorder under all conditions. Overdiagnosis is surely happening within the former group. But the latter groupin many communitiesactually remains underdiagnosed.

I now think that the worthwhile story to tell isn’t the one about the excesses of our era. It is rather about howin this brave new world of diagnosismedicationbrain sciencesocial serviceseducational reformprivate consultantssupport groupsInternet chat rooms and endless playground conversations about this or that nutritional therapy and this or that occupational therapyparents of children with issues still find themselves so profoundly alone. With all the talk and all the therapy and the theorizing and the moralizingwe as a society are still failing them and their kids.

I’m going to leave you with a few questions:

What if children’s troublesome symptoms are not their truest form of self-expression?

What ifin the pastit really wasn’t so great to leave “quirky” kids to tough it out on their own?

What if recycling a watered-down version of ’60s-era radical thinking about psychiatry and the normalizing evils of mainstream society (“Mental illness is the revolt that the free organism in its total entity invents in order to live in an unbearable situation,” is how Jean-Paul Sartre once put it) isn’t the best approach to take in today’s world?

What if the whole topic deserves a new kind of radical rethinking?

Note to readers: For the next two weeksI will be writing a column for The New York Times Op-Ed page. My next column for TimesSelect will appear on FridayMarch 23.
 217,  2018, a, “Seeking help is a sign of strength,” said Timothy Marchelldirector of the Skorton Center for Health Initiatives at Cornell University. “It’s normal for many students to struggleand they should know there are people on campus who can help.”

Almost every college and university has a campus counseling center to which students are supposed to be referred if a faculty member believes they are in a downward spiral academically or emotionally. Sometimesfor ongoing servicesstudents will be referred to outside therapists.

And the incidence and potential for crises mounts annually. According to the National College Health Assessmentthere’s been a dramatic increase in the number of students suffering from depression — to 40.2 percent last year nationwide from 32.6 percent in 2013. Likewiseduring that same periodthere has been an increase in those thinking about suicideto 11.5 percent from 8.1 percentand those attempting suicideto 1.7 percent from 1.3 percentduring the same period. About one student in 12 has a suicide plan.

For the seventh year in a rowcollege counseling centers report an increase in the number of students seeking treatment who represent “threat-to-self,” according to this year’s report from the Center for Collegiate Mental Health.

Many institutions of higher learning are struggling to keep up with the demand. For exampleCornell Health Counseling and Psychological Serviceswhich provided care for the 13 percent of Cornell University students experiencing debilitating depressionstress and anxiety in 2005-6counseled 21 percent of the student population in 2016-17. They have also added 10 full-time employeesfor a current total of 32 counselors to provide the needed services for 14,500 undergraduates and 7,000 graduate studentsa better-than-average ratio.

The university has also created a “Caring Community” with a website that directs students to helpincluding emergency servicesfor all kinds of health-related issues.

One link under “Notice and Respond” directs anyone concerned about another student to potentially lifesaving information. It lists 13 signs of distressfrom “falling behind and missing classes” to “impulsivity and unnecessary risk-taking” to “verbal or written threats of suicideor expressions of hopelessness or a wish to die.” It also provides guidance on how to respond in a caring mannernoting that the only real risk is doing nothing.

 1560,  2010, a, With publishers looking for ways to capitalize on e-booksstarting an independent publishing house may be as foolhardy as investing in Betamax. But that’s not stopping Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth. He and the editor/publisher Eva Prinz founded Ecstatic Peace Library (ecstaticpeacelibrary.comor facebook.com/pages/Ecstatic-Peace-Library/346362294368)which features artdesignphotography and poetry booksincluding “Fly Me” by Yoko Onoa limited-edition book and box of kiteseach with a kite framestringsinstructions on flying and a message from Ono.

Moore hatched the Ecstatic Peace franchise a decade ago. In 2001 he started the Ecstatic Peace Poetry Journal and has published it every year since. He and Andrew Kesin run a record label called Ecstatic Peace Records and Tapeswhich releases music by their favorite indie musicianslike Hush ArborsLuke Roberts and Tall Firs. “Thurston is building an underground consortium quietly taking over the world,” Prinz joked.

Journals and record labels are one thingbut whywhen the future of the book is in questionwould anyone start a traditional publishing imprint? “Small-press publishing is a tradition that at times can be pleasurable for us and other times spiritual,” Moore said. Indeedthe more solid the nichethe greater the potential for success. So farEcstatic Peace Library has produced handmade limited-edition art catalogs and modest editions of poetry chapbooks. But its first catalog of widely distributed art books (through DAP) this fall will logically be focused on music. “One could say that music is our nicheand three out of seven of the titles are packaged with vinyl records,” Moore explained.

Ecstatic Peace Library has a decidedly eclectic point of view. Last year it released 500 signed/numbered catalogs of the photographer Justine Kurland’s recent train-hopping landscapes and portraits. It was followed by 100 handmade copies of “Go Vegan!” by the artist Jonathan Horowitz. Back in the music nichethere is “The Noise Paintings,” by Thurston’s wife and bandmateKim Gordonwhich comes with a cassette. There are poetry chapbooksas well as the Yoko Ono bookabout which Moore added: “We are hoping to fly these on Labor Day weekend in Strawberry Fields.”

Moore and Prinz believe that the analog and digital are more distinct in books than in other media. “To say that an art book can be an e-book is ignorant of the tradition and art of color separationsprinting and binding,” Prinz said. “Likewiseto suspect that a digital storytelling experience is simply a pdf downloaded on your iPad or Kindle platform is disrespectful to the interactive arts and artists.” She has been experimenting with video game technology to create their first e-book. “In similar processes to those employed by the 1960s experimental subcommittee of the College de Pataphysiquea group of French writers and poets who called themselves OuLiPo (Ouvroir de litterature potentielle),” Prinz continued“Ecstatic Peace Library is creating new ways to ‘escape’ into literature and art.” Next yearthey are hoping to introduce a few of those productionsas well as a Web-exclusive “Abbie Hoffman-inspired Free Storeto release bookspoetry and art for free.”

These days more books are being made as “objects” and “experiences,” so Moore and Prinz have been perfecting the format for a so-called record/book. “After 25 maquetteswe finally nailed the industrial design,” Moore explained. “The record is affixed to the cover of the book so that the label on the record itself is the cover image and can change depending on whether side A or B is up.”

Ecstatic Peace Library books arehoweverjust a slice of the operation. There are also readings and exhibitions (at places like White Columns and Tate Modern) and performances (Cosmic Newsstand and “A Dissertation on White Noise” benefit for “Avant-Garde Preschool” P.S. 126 at Partners & Spade).

But the duo is most excited by the book “James Hamilton: You Should Have Heard Just What I Seen,” which will be released in November. Hamiltona photographer for The Village Voicehad an archive that had never been cracked open“so it had to be published,” Prinz said. “Thurston looked through every week of Hamilton’s interesting lifeevery protestriotconcertpersonal appearancesigningin-storeafter-partypress conferencestudio rehearsalsound check. I recall asking him with indignation whether he was really that into Rod Stewart when I found him hunched over with his loupe one afternoonlooking through Rod Stewart’s contact sheets. He pointed out Patti Smith in the picturesand told me that Patti was interviewing Rod for Crawdaddy! magazine. It was so randombut so cool — Rod and Patti had the exact same haircut.” Other titles they had to publish are those thataccording to Prinz“we’ve pitched to publishers for years but were too obscure for anybody.” She cited a November release“Party With Me Punker” by Jordan Schwartz and Dave Markeyas one that “nobody ‘got’ when I brought it into editorial meetings at Rizzoli and Abrams,” she recalled. “Thurston and I do not really feel it’s necessary to make something that we know someone else would publish.”

Correction:

An earlier version of this post misstated the name of the book by the artist Jonathan Horowitz. It is “Go Vegan!,” not Vegan Zine.

 5625,  1986, a, Warnings by the Reagan Administration that it would oppose further World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank loans if Chile's leaders did not improve their human rights recordappear to have shaken the ruling junta a bit. According to the Center for International PolicyChile asked that final consideration of some $250 million in multilateral development bank loans be postponed until November.

They had originally been scheduled for consideration in September or October.

RecentlyAssistant Secretary of State Elliot Abrams warned thatif Chile did not move toward a democracythe Administration would oppose any of the new loans. Chile's PresidentGen. Augusto Pinochetin turnthreatened to stop payment on all of Chile's $20 billion in foreign debtthe highest per capita in South America.

But that could just be necessary grandstanding. Future financing that might total $1.5 billion from private banks appears to hinge on Chile's good standing with the World Bank and the development bank. As suchalthough the loan was in the final stages of approval''Chile claimed that it needed additional time to get its economic plans in order before presenting the loan to the World Bank executive board,'' the international policy center said.

Unlike the tally for American servicemembersno official count is availablefor the number of civilians killed in Iraq.Estimates based on mortuary talliesnewsreports and household surveys vary widely.

Using figures provided by the Iraq Ministryof Healthwhich counts violent deaths athospitals across the countryand Baghdad'scentral morguethe United NationsAssistance Mission for Iraq has estimatedthat more than 28,000 Iraqi civilians werekilled during the first 10 months of 2006anumber 40 times higher than the number ofAmerican service members killed duringthat time.

The American military has criticizedthe civilian count as highbut it has notreleased statistics of its own. In its quarterlyreports to Congressthe Pentagon hasprovided a rough estimate of the number ofIraqi civilians and security forces killed orwounded by insurgents. That number hasrisen sharplyto an average of more than 90a day since last May.

 4816,  1991, a, On the eve of his first venture into the heated world of Soviet politics in the provincesPresident Bush was denounced today by the Ukraine's leading independence movement as having been "hypnotized by Gorbachev" at the summit meeting.

The Ukrainian popular movement known as Rukhthe umbrella group for more than a dozen of the republic's opposition partiesoffered Mr. Bush an advance sample of the sharp-edged politics that await him in this richsprawling republicwhich the President will visit on Thursday on his way home from Moscow.

Ukrainian politicians cautioned him today to expect the six-hour visit to be no easyfolksy photo opportunity.

Ivan Drachthe Rukh chairmansaid Mr. Bush was so supportive and uncritical of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that Mr. Bush would arrive here as the Soviet leader's "messenger," with no real appreciation of the suffering that the Ukrainian republic has seen under the Kremlin because of its yearning for independence.

 5367,  1987, a, As Mikhail S. Gorbachev delivered a televised New Year's address to the Soviet UnionPresident Reagan's radio speech could be heard over the Voice of America early today on short-wave radios in spite of some jamming.

According to American diplomats who monitored Mr. Reagan's broadcast hereit was audible on most of the frequencies used by Russian-language broadcasts of the Voice of America. One diplomat said that on at least two frequencies the broadcast could be easily understood. On other frequenciesthe speech was drowned by static.

Listeners in Leningrad reportedly received the President's message clearly.

Mr. Reagan decided to beam his message to the Soviet Union by radio over the Voice of America after the Soviet Union rejected a White House proposal for an exchange of televised New Year's messages between Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev.

Soviet spokesmen said such an exchange would be inappropriate in light of what they described as a poor state of relations between the two countriesnotably over the issue of arms control.

 5261,  1988, a, The new ''Mikado'' - which will shortly be seen in Los Angeles with Dudley Moore in Mr. Idle's place - startled the British press and public by throwing out the usual Japanese trappings in favor of a British hotel lobby of the late 1920'scomplete with a monochromaticaly dressed cast straight out of a Marx Brothers film. Mr. Miller's aim was to bring Gilbert's burlesque of English manners closer to our time by changing the setting to something more recognizable to modern audiences. Detractors thought the change just as arbitrary and gimmicky as Mr. Miller's ''Rigoletto'' resetting in New York's Little Italyanother production done for the E.N.O.and others pointed out that the spectacle of japonaiserie was part of the thrill of ''The Mikado,'' whether in 1885 or a century later.

On the recordingthe sets and costumes are immaterialand those seeking any revisionist reading of Gilbert's lyrics or Sullivan's score will find very few changes. They will find just over an hour of musicleft untouched and sung nicelyand a new set of lyrics for Ko-Ko's ''little list'' song. Thesewritten by Mr. Idle and Mr. Miller (and published by Kay-Gee-Bee Music)attempt a mild offensiveness in the Monty Python mode. During his lifetimeGilbert sanctioned encore verses - written by himself - and it might have been a good idea to have let Mr. Idle do the originals first. (In performancethere is a new overture of no great interestwhich has not been included here.) Of the singersI enjoyed Felicity Palmer as Katisha; some may find Bonaventura Bottone's Nanki-Poo just too-too in its exaggerated 1920's musical-comedy tone. By releasing only highlightsthe original British record company seems to have judged that the public would want just a souvenir of this picturesque productionrather than a musically complete version.

The new ''Ruddigore'' is a different matterbeing more complete than any previous version of the operetta. In the days that followed the badly received premiere of that operettaGilbert and Sullivan made quite a few cuts and changesmostly in the problematic second actin which a chorus of ghosts not only step out of their picture framesbut marry the female chorus at the work's conclusion. This distasteful finale was replaced (although one of the dead baronets still teams up with his former sweetheart) and the offending ''y'' in ''Ruddygore'' was changed to an ''i'' at a time when ''ruddy'' or ''bloody'' were too much for family audiences.

In spite of these alterationsa respectable eight-month London run and various toursthe operetta sank into a ghostly oblivion. When it finally was revived in London in 1921two D'Oyly Carte musical directors had made numerous ''improvements'' on Sullivan's original manuscriptand anotherMalcolm Sargentadded his own thoughts a few seasons later.

Surprisinglymany of these emendations improved ''Ruddigore'' - the 1920's overture (like the originalnot arranged by Sullivan) is more excitingthe ghost scene is thrillingly condenseddiscarding a dull dead march and some weary choral responsesas well as two attempts at a patter song right after the ghost scene that were simply ineffective. On the other handcertain cuts restored in this recording are delightfulparticularly the original finale (''When a Man Has Been a Naughty Baronet'')missing second versesand the charming love duet in Act I (''The Battle's Roar Is Over''). One also gets to hear the melodrame in Act II involving a daggerbut this would have been more effective with the dialogue it is supposed to accompany.
 5719,  1985, a, To the Editor:

Carlyle C. Douglas deserves credit for bringing attention to the gravity of Bedford-Stuyvesant's lead-poisoning problem (''In Brooklyn's Bedford-StuyvesantGlimmers of Resurgence Are Visible,'' news storyApril 19). Howeverthe article implies the commonly held misconception that the main cause of New York City's childhood lead-poisoning cases is toddlers picking and eating lead-coated paint chips from tenement walls.

Studies have shown that only about 20 percent of the city's cases are caused in this manner.

A majority of the city's childhood lead-poisoning cases are related directly to the deteriorating internal conditions of the apartment houses the children inhabit. Lead dust particles from crumbling walls and ceilings fall to the floor where young children walkcrawl and play. They then inadvertently ingest the particles from the air they breath ormore commonlyby placing fingers covered with lead-paint dust into their mouths.

Thusit should not be implied that the lead-poisoning victim is in any way to blame for his or her disease (i.e.picking and eating lead paint chips). Insteadwe should all begin to take account of the environmental hazards that childrenliving in neighborhoods such as Bedford-Stuyvesantface during their everyday lives.ANDREW B. BORINSTEIN New YorkApril 201985 The writera former research assistant for the New York Health Department's lead-poisoning-control programis a doctoral candidate in sociology at Columbia University.

 5241,  1988, a, New Cardin Beachhead

The largely untapped Chinese market is the target of a new venture linking Pierre Cardinthe French designerand Gruppo GFTan Italian manufacturer and distributor of ready-to-wear. The plan is to manufacture and to sell in China Mr. Cardin's clothing and accessories for menwomen and childrenhis home furnishings and his leather goods.

Mr. Cardin's name is already known in China. He showed his haute-couture collection there in 1979 and opened Maxim's restaurant in Beijing in 1983. He has also manufactured some apparel thereas has Gruppo GFT.

But just how much of a market for high fashion does China represent? ''The Chinese people like to dress,'' Mr. Cardin said by telephone from his Paris office. ''They have rejected the Mao suits. They don't like classique. They like high fashion. The clothes we will sell there will be the same as what I show in Paris. We are expecting to open 40,000 stores in China. It's a very big deal.'' Spring Hats Sprout

''This is a hat season,'' said Patricia Underwooda millinery designer. ''We're making them as fast as we possibly can. What we've shipped for spring is sellingand we're already getting reorders.''
 5514,  1987, a, New proof of the links between mental problems and overall health has been mustered in a large study of 29,915 Federal employees and their families who filed claims for mental-health treatment with Aetnafrom 1980 to 1983. The average of their claims for health problems of all kinds - not just psychological problems - was $158.82 a monthmore than 70 percent higher than health insurance claims of 16,468 other Federal employee families with the same coverage but no mental problems. On an encouraging noteafter mental-health treatmentthe group's use of both mental and general health care declinedto $137 a monthaccording to James O. Blosean analyst with the Human Ecology Institute in Chapel HillN.C.

Despite the downward trendhoweverthe average claim for people with psychological problems remained higher after three years of mental-health treatment than the average - $108 a month - three years before treatment was started.

Mr. Blose and Harold D. Holderdirector of the Prevention Research Center in BerkeleyCalif.published these findings in the October issue of Hospital and Community Psychiatry.

Dr. Kesslerof American Psychmanagementsaid large employers had recently been paying more attention to their mental-health costswhich often are rising 25 percent. Not soon enoughhoweversaid Kenneth S. Abramowitza health-care analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Company. ''Very few employers intelligently manage their mental-health benefits,'' he said. ''Corporate America has got to rethink its whole atttitude toward mental-health benefitsand I don't see them doing that until they get totally taken to the cleaners.'' Jeff Goldsmithhead of Health Futuresa Chicago management consultant firmis equally vehement. ''One of the hottest areas for cost containment over the next two or three years will be in-patient psychiatric servicesbecause of widespread abuse,'' Mr. Goldsmith said. ''So much of what they are doing could be moved to an out-patient basis.''

One method for minimizing hospitalization is a process known as case management. Service companies like Dr. Kessler's keep track of each mental-health claim. The case managerswho usually are psychiatric social workers or nurse clinical specialistsadvise physicians about alternatives to hospitalizationwhich may cost $4,000 per patient.

 3686,  1998, a, In the 1950's the passion for finding important moral lessons buried in ''Lolita'' was fed by the moral attacks against the book. The book was turned down by four American publishers before Olympia Pressa French press best known for its smutpublished ''Lolita'' in 1955. Shortly thereafterthe book was banned in France. Finallyin 1958an American publisherG. P. Putnam's Sonspicked it up.

The most recent wave of moral defense was sparkedyet againby moral outrage against ''Lolita.'' In 1997while Adrian Lynethe director of the new movie version of ''Lolita,'' searched for an American distributorNorman Podhoretz wrote in Commentary that ''Lolita'' bore ''some share of the blame for the plague of pedophilia.'' Nowafter much waiting and a brand new layer of moral justificationsthe new ''Lolita'' will be shown on Showtime tomorrow night and released in theaters in September. Here are the lessons of ''Lolita'' in their 1950's and 1990's versions.

Lolita is a cautionary tale.

Professor Ray said ''Lolita'' carried a warning: ''The wayward childthe egotistic motherthe panting maniac -- these are not only vivid characters in a unique story; they warn us of dangerous trends; they point out potent evils. Lolita should make all of us -- parentssocial workerseducators -- apply ourselves with still greater vigilance and vision to the task of bringing up a better generation in a safer world.''

Last year the philosopher Colin McGinn made a similar argument in an essay titled ''The Moral Case for 'Lolita,' '' in The Times Literary Supplement: ''This is not a prettification or celebration or endorsement of Humbert's actions. . . . It is an open expression of miseryremorseguilt and regret. . . . The book sees right into the heart of Humbert's deceptivenessbrutality and depravity; in no sense does it seek to excuse or mitigate them. . . . We are never for a moment encouraged to approve of his actions.

All men are Humberts.

This logic was first given by Humbert himselfwhen he says he is not the first man to fall in love with a child: ''After allDante fell madly in love with his Beatrice when she was 9a sparkling girleenpainted and lovely. . . . And when Petrarch fell madly in love with his Laureenshe was a fair-haired nymphet of 12 running in the windin the pollen and dust.''

 2106,  2007, a, The education of Donald Young continues.

He has had it hardlosing in the first round in five tournaments this year. He has had it easyadvancing to the third round of the United States Open with a walkover past 13th-seeded Richard Gasquet.

Saturday at Louis Armstrong Stadiumthe 18-year-old junior champion received a dose of grind-it-out Grand Slam tennis as he lost to 50th-ranked Feliciano Lopez3-66-37-6 (5)7-5.

Young showed flashes of brilliance. He won the first set with two service winners after he had blown an easy putaway off a net chord; he finished with 45 winners. He also showed flashes of inconsistency as he committed 45 unforced errors. But mostly he showed the fortitude to battle on a stadium court in front of an enthusiastic crowd.

The final point total: Lopez 132Young 125.

Youngwho is listed on the ATP Web site as 5-foot-9-inches tall and weighing 145 pounds showed surprising powerhitting 11 aces as his served reached a high of 135 miles per hour.

View From the Stands

By Thomas Lin

Lopez did just enough to win — in factthe match always rested on Young racket. Lopez traded lefty groundstrokes with him todayweathering many winners off Young’s best shot: the acute crosscourt forehandhis monstrous spin shooting the ball off the sideline and out of reach.

With a staunchly partisancapacity crowd in Louis Armstrong Stadium shouting “C’mon Donaldwe’re rooting for you” and “Go D-Money” and even one “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” it’s clear many see Young as the future of American tennis.

Near the end of the pivotal third set against LopezYoung put his entire arsenal on diplay in his best point of the match to get to 6-5. The point started with a number of groundstrokesYoung hitting the heavier strokes and pushing Lopez from side to side. As Young approached the netLopez hit a perfect lob that landed just inside the baseline. Young hit the acceleratorwheeling to the baseline and blazing the ball directly at Lopezwho deftly dropped the ball just over the net. Quickly reversing courseYoung charged the netreaching the drop shot with plenty of time to hit the winning passer.

But Lopez held serveleading to the third set tie break. The more experienced Lopez played the big points safelywhile Young continued to go for winners. The crowd gasped “Oh!” when he shanked a difficult overhead. They cheered his flatbackhand winner. There were gasps on almost every pointas Young has the kind of topspin that keeps fans wondering if the ball will sail longbut usuallyjust in the nick of timeit lands in the courtoften well within the baseline.

Unfortunately for Youngnot enough of these shots dropped. His last shot of the set went long and he was down two sets to onea deficit he was unable to overcome. He then almost hit the ball out of Armstrong Courtdrawing a code violation.

For American tennis fansthis match was no cause for despair. Young showed off his talent and speedand there will no doubt be many more victories to come. He also showed off his two biggest weaknesses — his service game and groundstroke consistency — andat 18he still has time to work on those and mature as a player.

Investors turned from stocks and into bondspushing long-term Government yields below 5 percent for the first time in more than 30 yearsreflecting worries about the economic crisis abroad and financial problems at home.

The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 237.90 pointsor 2.9 percentto 7,842.62but prices of Treasury securities rosepushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond down to 4.97 percent. [Page A1.]

 6381,  1970, a, The 7 per cent rise from 1969 to 1970 falls far short of the 26 per cent increase from 1968 to 1969. High in terest ratesand skyrocketing building costs have been factor in keeping down ex penditures for all commercial enterprizes.

While this indicates a sub stantial rise in capital in vestmentit falls short of the 10 per cent rise predicted for all businessand there can be no doubt that high interest ratesand skyrocket ing building costs have been a factor in keeping down expenditures for commercial enterprises.

If the large retail syndi cates are going to expand building new stores rather than by purchasing existing smaller companies. Opposi tion from the Justice De partment to some of the retail mergers in recent years has given pause to the idea of growth by acquisi tion.

Last weekHartSchaffner & Marxa men's clothing manufacturer agreed to dis pose of 30 of its retail cloth ing stores that it had ac quired since Jan. 11968. The agreement followed a suit filed by the Department of Justice to force the cloth ing company to dispose of 71 storesand is reminiscent of the agreement of Spartans Industries a few years ago to sell the Spartans Atlantic group of department stores when the company toik over the Korvette chain.

•

In the HartSchaffner & Marx caseas in the Spar tans casethe principle of dual distribution was in volved. Under dual distribu tiona manufacturer sells to other retailers and to com pany‐owned storessome times to the disadvantage of the outsider.

The question now is whether some equity has been established for the in dependent owner who is forced into competition with his suppliers they will have to do it by

As long as no provision is made for the prevention of the establishment of new outlets that are close to those of independent cus tomersthere is little chance of reducing the chance of unfair competition. In the HartSchaffner & Marx casethe disposal of 30 stores will have no bearing on the com pany's expansion program.

 1701,  2009, a, It is not every 31-year-old whoin a first government jobfinds himself dismantling General Motors and rewriting the rules of American capitalism.

But thatin shortis the job description for Brian Deesea not-quite graduate of Yale Law School who had never set foot in an automotive assembly plant until he took on his nearly unseen role in remaking the American automotive industryThe New York Times’s David E. Sanger writes.

Norfor that matterhad he given much thought to what ailed an industry that had been in decline ever since he was born.

A bit laconic and looking every bit the just-out-of-graduate-school student adjusting to life in the West Wing — “he’s got this beard that appears and disappears,” says Steven Rattnerone of the leaders of President Obama’s automotive task force — Mr. Deese was thrown into the auto industry’s maelstrom as soon the election-night parties ended.

“There was a time between Nov. 4 and mid-February when I was the only full-time member of the auto task force,” Mr. Deesea special assistant to the president for economic policyacknowledged recently as he hurried between his desk at the White House and the Treasury building next door. “It was a little scary.”

But nowaccording to those who joined him in the middle of his crash course about the automakers’ downward spiralhe has emerged as one of the most influential voices in what may become President Obama’s biggest experiment yet in federal economic intervention.

While far more prominent members of the administration are making the big decisions about Detroitit is Mr. Deese who is often narrowing their options.

A month agowhen the administration was divided over whether to support Fiat’s bid to take over much of Chryslerit was Mr. Deese who spoke out strongly against simply letting the company go into liquidationThe Times saidciting several people who were present for the debate.

“Brian grasps both the economics and the politics about as quickly as I’ve seen anyone do this,” Lawrence H. Summersthe head of the National Economic Council who is not known for being patient whenever he believes an analysis is sub-par — or disagrees with his owntold The Times. “And there he was in the Roosevelt Roomspeaking up vigorously to make the point that the costs we were going to incur giving Fiat a chance were no greater than some of the hidden costs of liquidation.”

Mr. Deese was not the only one favoring the Fiat dealbut his lengthy memorandum on how liquidation would increase Medicaid costsunemployment insurance and municipal bankruptcies ended the debate. The administration supported the dealand it seems likely to become a reality on Mondayif a federal judge handling the high-speed bankruptcy proceeding approves the sale of Chrysler’s best assets to the Italian carmaker.

Mr. Deese’s role is unusual for someone who is neither a formally trained economist nor a business school graduateand who never spent much time flipping through the endless studies about the future of the American and Japanese auto industries.

He lives a dual life these days. He starts the day at a desk wedged just outside of Mr. Summers’s officewhere he can hear what young members of the economic team have come to know as “the Summers bellow.” From therehe can make it quickly to the press office to help devise explanations for why taxpayers are spending more than $50 billion on what polls show is a very unpopular bailout of the auto industry.

Several times a day he speed-walks to Treasurytaking a shortcut through the tunnel under the colonnadenear the kitchens. The other day he talked about how sharply perceptions of the industry’s future changed after Mr. Obama’s election.

“At the first meeting with Rick Wagoner,” he told The Timesreferring to G.M.’s recently deposed chief executive“they were in a very different place. He said publicly that bankruptcy was not a viable option. It’s been a long process getting everyone to look at the options differently.”

In factfrom before Inauguration Dayfew in Mr. Obama’s circle saw any other choice. Every time Mr. Deese ran the numbers on G.M. and Chryslerhe came back with the now-obvious conclusion that neither was a viable businessand that their plans to revive themselves did not address the erosion of their revenues. But it took the support of Mr. Rattner and Ron Bloomsenior advisers to the task force charged with restructuring the automobile industryto help turn Mr. Deese’s positions into policy.

“The president’s instruction to us was that we had to come up with a solution that would work on a commercial basisthat didn’t involve indefinite federal financing,” Mr. Deese told The Times. “But we didn’t want liquidationwhich would have even worse effects. So the question was how do you design a very substantial restructuringand do it fast.”

Mr. Deese’s route to the auto table at the White House was anything but a straight line. He is the son of a political science professor at Boston College (his father) and an engineer who works in renewable energy (his mother). He grew up in the Boston suburb of Belmont and attended Middlebury College in Vermont. He went to Washington to work on aid issues and was quickly hired by Nancy Birdsalla widely respected authority on the effectiveness of international aid and the founder of the Center for International Development.

But he wanted to learn domestic issues as welland soon ended up working as an assistant for Gene Sperlingwho 17 years ago in the Clinton White House played a similar role as economic policy prodigy. EventuallyMr. Deese headed to Yale for his law degree. But his e-mail box was constantly filled with messages from friends in Washington who were signing up to work for the Obama or Hillary Rodham Clinton campaigns. Mr. Deese chose Senator Clinton’s.

“He was pretty quickly functioning as the top economic policy staffer through her campaign,” Mr. Sperling told The Times. “He could blend the policy needs and the political needs pretty seamlessly.” On the day that the Clinton campaign endedMr. Deese left her concession speech and received a message on his BlackBerry from a friend in the Obama campaign urging him to sign on immediately to Mr. Obama’s team.

He resumed his policy work thereand found himself stuck in Chicago — unable to fly to Washington with his dog — as the economic crisis deepened. Finallyone nighthe decided to get into his car with his dog and just started driving back to Washington. Tiredhe pulled over to catch some sleep in the car.

“I slept in the parking lot of the G. M. plant in LordstownOhio,” he recalled. The giant plantopened during G.M.’s heyday in the mid-1960sis where the Pontiac G5 is produced. Under the plan Mr. Deese worked on when he arrived in WashingtonPontiac will disappear.

“I guess that was prophetic,” he told The Timesshaking his head.

 229,  2018, a, Alaska Airlines apologized this week after a flight attendant asked a gay man to give up his seat next to his partner so a straight couple could sit togetheran exchange that put the airline on the defensive as it rebutted claims of discrimination.

David Cooleythe owner of a gay bar in West Hollywood called the Abbeywrote on Facebook on Sunday that he and his partner had boarded a flight to Los Angeles from New York when a flight attendant asked if Mr. Cooley’s partner would move from his seat “so a couple could sit together.”

Mr. Cooley said he told the attendant that the two men were a couple and that he wanted to sit with his partner. But the attendant gave Mr. Cooley’s partner a choice: Move for the other couple or get off the plane.

“We could not bear the feeling of humiliation for an entire cross-country flight and left the plane,” Mr. Cooley said. “I cannot believe that an airline in this day and age would give a straight couple preferential treatment over a gay couple and go so far as to ask us to leave.”

 4256,  1994, a, Now that the auto makers are in that boxMr. Bieber clearly relishes keeping them thereinsisting that they sell all 60,000 and create all 15,000 new jobs. "By GodI'll tell you thiswe're going to keep tabs of how many are sold thereand we're going to remind people of this," he said. Parts Supplier Movements

While he does not expect the auto makers to move assembly plants to Mexico overnightMr. Bieber said he thought they would begin pushing their parts suppliers to relocate there in pursuit of lower-cost labor.

In a recent interview at Solidarity Housethe U.A.W.'s headquarters hereMr. Bieber reflected both on his recent defeat on the trade agreement and on what most auto analysts regard as his recent victory over the Big Three in national labor contract negotiations. As he spoke about the future of labor and of his union -- whose diverse but declining membership includes not only auto workers but state employees and jai alai players -- he adopted a wait-and-see attitude toward Mr. Clintonwhose support he acknowledged he needs to fulfill a broad legislative agenda.

"I have great respect," Mr. Bieber allowed with the faintest of grins"for his ability to get people to vote his way."

IndeedMr. Bieber has not taken the big picture of him with Mr. Clinton off his office walldespite the irony that the President's scribble has acquired since the trade agreement vote: "with thanks for all your help."

"We worked hard in 1992 to help elect Bill Clinton President of the United States," Mr. Bieber said. "I have no regrets." Fourth and Final Term at U.A.W.

The remaining three space shuttles have been grounded since the Columbia disintegrated in the atmosphere upon re-entry on Feb. 12003resulting in the loss of its seven-member crew.

But the presiding officer of the hearingLieut. Col. Robert Jarvissaid today that he would explore having Ms. Hoster recalled to active duty temporarily so that she could be required to appear at the hearing. To do thathe would have to obtain the agreement of Army Secretary Togo D. West Jr..

The witness today said that she did not file charges against Sergeant Major McKinney for several monthsbelieving that what had happened to her was an isolated incident. She said she changed her mind after hearing Ms. Hoster's accountbelieving that she had an obligation to support Ms. Hoster.

The chief petty officer described how she found Sergeant Major McKinney staring at her on the first day of the benefits conference.

''Everything I said to him he turned around into another pickup line,'' she testified. ''When I said I was nervoushe said I was 'nervous like a schoolgirl' and'I'll make you feel like a woman.' ''

As she testifiedSergeant Major McKinney sat impassively in the small room.

The womanwho is to be cross-examined by his lawyer on Tuesdaysaid the non-comissioned officer had told her that she struck him ''as a woman in need of some passion'' and that if she went to his room she would be exposed to passion like she had never experienced before.

She said she told him that she was flattered but that she was happily married and that going to his room would make her feel guilty. She said he replied: '' 'If you come up to my roomI promise you'll never feel guilty.' ''

Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lessonstudents examine promotional products for movies and brainstorm the ways that these items affect their purchasing behavior. Students then consider the profiles of specific consumer demographics and create posters explaining why a specific age group is a viable audience for specific advertisers. Finallystudents will prove or disprove the profiles they developed by finding and analyzing real advertisements targeted to their assigned consumer demographic.

Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Examine movie product tie-in samples and consider how they affect personal opinions about the products involved in these particular advertising campaigns.

2. Consider the trend of promoting movies through popular consumer products by reading and discussing the article “Summer Movie Tie-Ins Arriving Early.”

3. Develop profiles for specific age groups and determine which products and companies will profit the most from advertising to each particular demographic; create persuasive posters.

4. Compare the profiles and advertising concepts developed in their groups with real television and print advertisements geared to the target audience.

Resources / Materials:

-samples of movie product tie-inssuch as figurinescupspostersclothingparty decorationsetc. (minimum of five; preferably different types of products)

-pens/pencils

-paper

-student journals

-classroom blackboard

-copies of the article “Summer Movie Tie-Ins Arriving Early” (one per student)

-construction paper (one piece per student)

-markers or colored pencils (enough for students to share)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Prior to classarrange desks in to as many groups as there are samples of movie product tie-ins availableand place one item in the center of each grouping. Upon entering classstudents respond to the following prompt in their journals (written on the board prior to class): “What is a ‘tie-in’? What type of tie-in product does your group have? What age group does this item interestand why? What is the consumer ‘getting’ by having this product? Does this product make you want to see the related movie more? Why or why not? Does it make you want to buy more of this particular product? Why or why not?” After a few minutesallow students time to share their answers within their small groups and then with the class. As a classdiscuss: Why might movie companies promote their movies through tie-ins such as those seen in class? What other types of companies typically use tie-ins to promote their goods or services? What other tie-in samples do the students in the classroom have with themand why did they purchase these items rather than similar items that are not promotional?

2. As a classread and discuss the article “Summer Movie Tie-Ins Arriving Early,” focusing on the following questions:

a. How many movies will be released during the 2003 summer movie season?

b. With what does Susan Nunziata compare the movie promotions discussed in the article?

c. What are the three negative results saturating the marketaccording to the article?

d. How many cross-marketing campaigns has Tanqueray gin done prior to the 2003 summer movie season?

e. With what values does Tanqueray associate itself?

f. According to Russell Weinerhow are movie brands and product brands joined together? What is an example of this joining?

g. According to Jeff Bellhow do BBDO and the Arnell Group decide which brands should be packaged with Jeep products?

h. According to Mr. Bellwhat is the ideal scenario for a marketing campaign?

i. What connection do marketers make between buying behavior and weather?

3. Divide students into six groups. Explain that each group is going to act as an advertising agency representing a specific age group. Each agency will be responsible for creating a profile of this age group and then for designing posters that inform other agencies why this age group is a perfect target audience for particular consumer products of their choice. Assign each group to a particular age demographicsuch as elementary school childrenteenagerscollege studentsyoung professionalsmiddle aged adults and the elderly.

Firstallow each group approximately 10 minutes to develop a profile of their assigned demographic group by answering the following questions (written on the board for easier student access):

–What is the approximate age range for people in this demographic group?

–What are the typical characteristics of people in this age group?

–What are the interests of this age group?

–What is their source of income?

–What might be their greatest social and economic concerns?

–What issues regarding products might be important to them?

–Where would they do the majority of shopping? (onlinemega-storesboutiquesetc.)

–What types of products do you think are targeted to this audience?

After the group completes their profileeach group member will imagine that he or she is a part of an advertising team hailed as experts for the group’s assigned demographic. Individuallyeach student will choose a different company or product that would likely benefit from advertising to the group’s assigned age group. Each student should begin by choosing a company or productsuch as a soda companyfast food chainetc. He or she then will have ten to fifteen minutes to create a poster on a piece of construction paper “selling” this demographic group to this particular company. On the posterstudents should be sure to include aspects of the demographic profile created by the whole group to express natural connections between audience and productas well as important spokespeople or types of advertising (print mediacommercialsinstant messagesetc.) that can help to make this company’s or product’s advertising more meaningful. It is acceptable to target companies that already market to this particular demographicbut whenever possiblestudents should expand their ideas to include products and companies that are not familiar to the demographicas well as advertising strategies and mediums that may not currently be used.

After posters are completedstudents will present them to their assigned groups. During these brief presentationsgroup members should consider the value of this company or product to their assigned age group and take notes on how effective each idea could be. After all students have presentedthe group will vote on the two or three (depending on group size) strongest products or companies that deserve the business of their assigned demographic.

The class should then reconveneand students should reflect on their group workfocusing on the following questions: How are ties between a particular demographic and a particular company or product formed? What might affect this relationship? What is the most effective way to reach each demographic? Why?

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individuallystudents should watch television or look through newspapers and magazines to find advertisements that are obviously targeted to their assigned demographic. Theneach student should write an analysis comparing the profile created during class the actual ads found in the consumer marketplace. In a future classstudents should display their posters and discuss their homework findings and analyses.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–What is the “law of diminishing returns”?

–Why are summer movies more popular for large marketing campaigns than movies released at other times during the year?

–Why is New York’s advertising industry called “Madison Avenue”?

–How do particular products get placed in movies and on television?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on thoughtful journal entriesparticipation in class and group discussionsmeaningful posters illustrating which companies or products best fit their assigned demographicsclear presentations to their group and the classand thorough analysis of advertisements geared to their assigned age demographics.

Vocabulary:

lucrativebarragecineplexesfreneticindicativeblitztranscendgravercacophonousdovetailinundated

Extension Activities:

1. Interview a representative from an advertising agency mentioned in the article read in class or from a local agency. How does a concept go from being just an idea to an actual print or television commercial? Write a newspaper article explaining your findings.

2. Create a jingle for a company that was chosen by your assigned demographics group. Make sure to include qualities that would appeal to the profile of your age group. Present jingles in a future class and evaluate their potential effectiveness.

3. Design an ad campaign for a popular product and a movie that is coming out for the 2003 summer movie season. What are the connections between the two? Who is the target audienceand why? What other promotional items might this movie consider?

4. Write a research paper exploring the history of name-brand products that appear in movies or on television. When did name brands like Coca-Cola replace generic cans of soda? Why? When did movies begin to take advantage of product placement? How do product placements impact your viewing of a movie or television show as an audience member?

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Create an exhibit about a famous American advertising campaignsuch as Uncle Sam or Rosie the Riveter. Historicallywhat was happening in the United States during the time of this campaign? Why was this campaign so memorable? Who was targeted by this campaign? What was being “sold” by this campaign?

Civics- Write a research paper examining copyright laws as they relate to consumer products and major motion pictures. What does the law require when a name brand is bundled for marketing campaigns? Why can’t a product be used in a film without permission? How must this product be used?

Economics- Choose a popular consumer itemsuch as McDonald’s fast foodNike sneakersJeep cars or Coca-Cola products. Create a pie chart illustrating how marketing dollars were spent on this product over the past yearand evaluate your findings.

Fine Arts- Create a print advertisement that illustrates weak product bundlingsuch as a Rugrats movie with Tanqueray gin or denture cream to teenagers.

 2179,  2006, a, Not long after the owners of the infamous Watergate Hotel announce its condo conversiontwo reports come out that say the Washington area has too many condos already.

The poor building–site of the break-in that brought down Richard Nixononce the home of Monica Lewinskyand designed by Luigi Morettithe Italian architect who became a fascist and prospered under Benito Mussolini–just can’t catch a break.

MetroStudy’s Kenneth Wenholddirector of the company’s Virginia-Maryland divisionpredicted in an interview that so many condos are under construction or plannedparticularly in Arlington and Fairfax countiesthat “there is a very significant problem” of overbuilding and the potential for projects to go bust.

Butas must be required by some super-secret real estate industry pactthere is the caveat that things don’t look that bad:

But the report concludes that the expectations of continued strong job growthstrong housing demand and low interest ratesplus the relative lack of affordability of other kinds of housingwill keep condo sales from crashing in most marketsincluding in the Washington area. “We are likely to experience a soft landing in most major metro marketsbut less gentle in others,” the Delta report found. Cities with the greatest risk of a hard landing — those with a lot of condo production and conversionhigh levels of speculator activity and modest levels of job growth — are Las VegasMiami and Phoenixthe report said.

The reports come from MetroStudya Houston-based market research firmand Delta Associatesan Alexandria-based affiliate of Transwestern Co. — DAMON DARLIN

 3061,  2001, a, EXACTLY 125 years ago next monthAlexander Graham Bell said into the very first telephone''Mr. Watsoncome hereI want to see you.'' Nobody remembers what the inventor of the first cordless phone saidbut it was probably''Heyhas anyone seen the handset?''

There's no disputing that cordless phones offer a degree of freedom lacking in curly-cord phones; for one thinga cordless phone ends the noisy humiliation of dragging your telephone off the desk while reaching for a pencil. Unfortunatelywhen a cordless conversation endsso does the freedom -- sooner or later you must return the phone to its base stationwhich is tethered to a phone jack. As a resulttypical cordless phones are really only slightly less tied down than corded ones.

But a new era of phone freedom has dawnedthanks to a new breed of phone: the multihandset cordless. These systems let you park the base station anywhere in your home or small officeeven someplace inaccessible. Then you can strategically position as many cordless handsets as you need -- up to eight or nine -- all over the premises. The tiny recharging stand that comes with each handset requires a power outlet but no phone linefreeing you to stash phones into oddball corners that aren't anywhere near phone jacks.

That freedom of placementhoweveris only the first joy of multihandset phones; another huge advantage is their corporate-style communications features. For exampleyou can make intercom-style calls from handset to handset without tying up the phone line. You can transfer a call you've just answered to the base or to another handset without having to cover the mouthpiece and yell''It's for you!'' And most let you check for messages on the base station's answering machine from any handset in the houseconserving precious muscle energy.

Hectic trading was dominant in the first week of Augustdue to international tension in Southeast Asia. Howeverafter that flurry of trading excitement endedthe market settled into a dull trading pattern for the final 16 sessions of the month.

On August 3 President Johnson ordered “retaliatory action against gunboats and certain supporting facilities in North Vietnam after renewed attacks against American destroyers in the Gulf of Tonkin.”

The following day volume spurted to 4.78 million shares from 3,783,745 on Monday and the New York Times combined average fell 7.38 points. Volume was heavy on Aug. 5 as the market rallied and rose at the close of trading when it was learned that this nation's offensive action in the Gulf of Tonkin would be of a limited nature. Sales on that day totaled 6,166,015 shares.

NEW ORLEANSLa.Feb. 28. -- The cotton market was characterized during the past week by a decided activity in contrast with the many weeks of dullness which preceded it.

 428,  2016, a, But these bits are scattered in an uneven series of sketches piled and paper-clipped together like the documents on the table. The show’s twin political preoccupations of colonialism and gender often split apartand the successive segmentssometimes separating into just sound or just filmare widely spacedas if Mr. Hafez didn’t trust his audience to process more than one idea or sensation at a time. Insteadfor large swaths of the nearly two-hour durationhe seems determined to make viewers experience the terrible boredom of any political conferenceeven one that upends the world.

Boredom is also risked in “-55,” a solo that the Moroccan choreographer Raduoan Mriziga performed at New York Live Arts on Thursday. In street clotheshe executes a series of taskseventually creating an intricate design on the floor with chalk and tape. The title tells you how many minutes it takes.

Since 2008Mr. Mriziga has lived and worked in Brusselswhere he attended the influential school P.A.R.T.S. “-55,” his first workseems to be in a familiar mode of Euro-American postmodernism. The initial motions — walkingarm swinginglying on his back — are pedestrianthough lightly decorated with snapsclapscurlicues and hand-to-foot suggestions of folk dance. Segments repeatin different orientations.

In addition to the body percussionsound comes from five cassette decks placed (as is the audience) on four sides surrounding Mr. Mriziga. The sound is highly fragmentaryas if mostly erased. When Mr. Mriziga lays out his floor geometryhe measures its proportions with his body: a line twice his heighta circle traced from the turning point of an elbow with the radius of a forearm.

 2,  2019, a, Voting rights and partisan gerrymanderingtraditionally the preoccupation of wonky party strategists and good-government groupshave become major flash points in the debate about the integrity of American electionssignaling high stakes battles over voter suppression and politically engineered districts ahead of the 2020 presidential race.

When Democrats take the majority in the House on Thursdaythe first bill they plan to introduce will be broad legislation focusing on these issues. Early drafts of their proposals include automatic voter registrationpublic elections financing and ending gerrymandering by using independent commissions to draw voting districts.

But action and anger go far beyond Congress. With voters increasingly aware of the powerful impact of gerrymandering and doubtful about the fairness of electionsvoting issues have become central to politics in key states including FloridaGeorgiaMichiganNorth CarolinaPennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Questions about the health of American democracy are being raised in areas once thought to be wholly nonpartisanas reflected in a court battle over whether the Trump administration is trying to use a question about citizenship on the 2020 census to undercount Democratic constituencies and limit their political clout.

 2240,  2006, a, “Look at that!” said my companionpointing to a glass of a French rosé that a server at Bouchon Bakery had just given me.

“I know — I love the color,” I answered.

“Not the color,” she said. “The pour!”

I had noticed thattoo. In fact it was the first thing I noticed. Although the stemless glass was broadthe level of wine in it rose highindicating a generous measure. But I hadn’t assumed it was what she was talking aboutbecause I don’t assume that everybody — correction: anybody — is as concerned with the volume of wine in his or her glass as I am.

How concerned am I?

When a server puts an already-filled glass of wine on the tablethe amount of wine instantly draws my attention. It’s my go-to appraisalmy litmus test: is this place being stingy and prissy or is it encouraging people to indulgemaking them feel appreciated and amply nourished?

When a server puts an empty glass on the tablelifts a bottle of winetilts the bottle toward the glass and then begins to fill that glassmy breath catches for a second. My heart skips a beat. (OKI’m exaggeratingbut — trust me — only slightly.) I want as much of that wine as a restaurant can reasonably be expected to provide.

AndI confessI want a bit more of that wine than a principled connoisseur would counsel. You know: there’s supposed to be a certain amount of air in the glass so that the wine can open properlyso that its perfume has adequate space in which to swim and swirl toward your nose.

I’ve got nothing against swimmingand I emphatically endorse swirlingbut I also like a few extra sips before I have to ask for my next glass. (For the purposes of this post and discussionI’m talking about wines by the glass. The amount of wine a server pours from a bottle under my control is immaterial. If I want moreI’ll pick up the bottle myself.)

I shared some of these thoughts with my companion at Bouchonwho in turn shared a story about Washington Parka restaurant that once sat on the corner of Fifth Avenue and Ninth Street in Greenwich Village. She and her husband had dined there one eveningand a server poured them some wine by the glassand when they looked at the liquid in the glassesit seemed puny indeed.

So they summoned the serverwho snappishly said“That’s our standard five-ounce pour.”

There was something so joyless and rigid about the statementmy companion recalledthat it became a sort of code phrase that she and her husband subsequently used to signal uptight situations. One of them would turn to the other and blurt“That’s our standard five-ounce pour.”

Neither of them likes the standard five-ounce pour.

Which raises the question: is five ounces a standard pour?

Yesfor the most partand it’s a sensible pourand sometimeswhen you feel cheatedit’s because you got less than that. Sometimes it’s because the glass is so big that the volume of wine in it looks small. Context and optical illusion play parts in whether you feel you’ve been treated well.

Five-ounce pours allow restaurants to get five glasses out of a bottlewhich has a bit more than 25 ounces in it. But some restaurants give six-ounce pours (perhaps priced accordingly) and figure on four glasses per bottlewith an ounce or so of “angel share” left over. That’s what Robert Bohrthe sommelier at Crucalled the excess amount that somehow disappearsas if it just evaporatesas if unseen forces consume it.

I called Robert because Cru inhabits the spot that Washington Park did; because Cru has one of the most extensive wine lists in the city; because I observed in my visits to Cru that Robert is an intelligent and kind guy; and because when I turned to my electronic RolodexI spotted his number before those of any other sommeliers in town.

Robert told me that the six-ounce pours at Cru aren’t just a matter of generosity. They’re a matter of arithmetical neatness. Crulike more and more restaurants in New Yorkpermits diners to have three-ounce tastes instead of full glasses of many wines. If those three-ounce tastes kept company with five-ounce glasseswellthe 24 or 25 divisible ounces in the bottle might not get divided all that cleanly. Toward the end of a bottleyou might have two ounceswhich wouldn’t be enough for a tasteor four ounceswhich wouldn’t be enough for a glass.

I don’t know how this turned into a second-grade math classbut it did. And I apologize.

Where was I? Ohwine pours.

I had a good one at Bouchondefinitely more than five ouncesand the wineby the waywas a Fenouillet Cotes du Ventoux roséfor $5 a glass or $13 a carafe. (Sadlyit’s off the list now — it was a delightful wine.)

I also had a good pour at Pareaa new Greek restaurant in the Flatiron district. But I received less voluminous bequests from two other new restaurantsMegu Midtownwhich is near the United Nationsand Degustationwhich is in the East Village.

At Megu Midtown I also encountered another of my wine-related frustrations: the attempt to remove a glass of wine that still had a full sip in it.

This happens all the time. And ifby chanceyou’re having a meal of paired food and wineduring which the restaurant is serving you many glasses of many different kinds of wineand if the food about to come is not the food that goes with the wine you’ve almost finishedthen the hasty removal is not such a bad thing.

But if you’re going to be ordering another glassand you now need that new glass sooner because the old glass is gonethe hasty removal isn’t optimal. I don’t think it’s an insidious attempt to pump up the bill. Too many almost-empty glasses would have to be removed too hastily for the series of gestures to equal one more glass of wine than you would otherwise have ordered.

But I do think it’s sloppy and inconsiderate.



The counter at Bouchon Bakery in the Time-Warner Center.

(Bartomeu Amengual for The New York Times) The counter at Bouchon Bakery in the Time-Warner Center.(Bartomeu Amengual for The New York Times)

Neither of those adjectives applies to Bouchonwhich I liked more than I had expected to. My colleague Peter Meehanin reviewing the restaurant recently in the Timesrightly noted that it’s an experience shaped entirely by expectations.

If you go there all Thomas Keller-gagaexpecting Per Se on the cheapyou’re going to be bummed. If you go there for a quick and casual bite in a mall with a viewyou’re going to be pleasedat least if you don’t mind dropping a bit of cash.

Sandwiches range from $9.75 (cashew butter and apricot jam) to $13.25 (roast beef and melted fontina). The quiche du jour is $10.75. But that got us a heftyinsanely rich wedge of quiche Florentine.

We liked our chilled cantaloupe and peekytoe crab soupand we loved Bouchon’s haute spin on a Nutter Butter cookiemaybe because we love Nutter Butter cookiesperiod. This one was big enough for two — a good thingbecause it costs $5.75.

But what I enjoyed more than anything else was how civilized Bouchon felt — how incredibly cosmopolitan and indulgent it felt to sit in an analogue to a food court and not be eating a hot dog or downing a milkshake.

Yesthere’s this monstrously large Samsung sign smack over your headso close that you fear it might fall and crush you. But once you’ve made peace with that possibilityyou can glance out the glass facade of the Time Warner Center and appraise Columbus Circlewhich — in case you haven’t noticed — now looks pretty fantastic. It’s a bona fide urban oasisringed by purple flowers.

The sense of light and space around you as you sit at Bouchonwhich is on the center’s third flooris really something. The mall in general and the restaurant in particular seem to draw a disproportionate number of foreign touristsso you can listen to the various accents and languages and feel tresor muchoor molto global.

Andas you doyou can sip decent wines. In fashionable glasses. Filled with generous pours.

 2523,  2004, a, Three more things to know about the process: Firstno article is guaranteed publication. Everything is written on spec. This applies to all articleseven those we commission. (Op-Ed is not a one-way street. We frequently call up people and invite them to write for us.) Secondwhat comes to Op-Ed stays in Op-Ed. Your ideas are not passed on to our Times colleagues for their use. Thirdbecause we receive so many submissionswe cannot respond to everyone who sends us an article. If you haven't heard from us within three business daysyou should assume that we are not going to be able to use your submission.

Are there guidelines for submitting an article? You bet. Shoot for about 750 words -- though it's worth remembering that some terrific and influential Op-Ed pieces have been as short as 300 words. Move quicklythe news does. EschewumI meanstay away from Olympian language and bureaucratic jargon (infrastructureinputsoutlays). Write the article the way you'd like to write it -- not the way you think The Times wants you to write it. Make one argument thoroughlypoint by point; the more detail the better. If you try to do too muchyou can wind up with an article thatin striving to say everythingends up saying nothing.

Alsoyou shouldn't feel that you have to rely on the written word alone. Maybe your point is expressed best in a charta graphican annotated illustration or a series of photographs. We're open to just about anythingso long as it's acceptable in a family newspaper. (Open letters to the president don't have a great history of success.)

A few other guidelines. Submissions must be exclusive. If you want us to consider your workplease send it here first. We don't publish articles that have appeared in other American publicationsand we rarely publish reprints of any kind. Contributors generally must let several months go by between appearances on the page. For more information on the submissions processplease see the box at the end of this article.

What happens once an article is accepted? It will start with a phone call or an e-mail message from an editor at Op-Ed. You'll be asked to sign a contract giving The Times the rightamong other thingsto distribute the article online and via other newspapers. Once the article has been scheduled for publication -- it could be days or even months after acceptance -- we'll edit and fact-check your work. Then we'll send you a copy for review. Nothing appears in the paper until the writer has signed off on the edited version.

There arehowevertwo zones of editorial privilege. We choose the illustrationswhich are created by artists to complement specific articles and are overseen by our art director. And we write the headlines. Contributors have no say in these matters. (You're in good company -- Times reporters don't write their headlineseither.) At the end of the dayyou'll receive a moderate payment.

All of our writers are obviously opinionated about their subjectsbut we try very hard to make sure our readers know if they have a financial or professional interest. Contributors are asked a lot of specific questions toward that end. In additionwe try to give readers enough information -- the dateline and identification linefor example -- so they can find out more about writers if they wish. Sadlymistakes happen. When they dowe do our utmost to correct them quickly. (Op-Ed corrections appear on the Op-Ed page.)
 5021,  1990, a, With the growing popularity of original-instruments performances of 19th-century compositionsa backlash is brewing from jealous standard-instruments performerspolemicists from within the movement and plain old thoughtful listenersdismayed at gushing hype. Even Roger Norrington and his London Classical Playersrecently hailed as the best of the bunchhave received their share of brickbats.

Sunday afternoon and Monday eveningMr. Norrington and his London musicians returned to Avery Fisher Hall for their second New York visit. Each program offered Beethoven's Fourth Symphonywhich duplication clearly cut down attendance by those who might have gone to both concerts.

The Monday concert included Mendelssohn's "Scottish" Symphonythe most "modern" score on both programsbut the Beethoven before the intermission almost played into the hands of the nay-sayers. It was hardly badgiven the skills of these musicians (still several years ahead of their American counterparts in technical ability and ensemble coherence) and Mr. Norrington's charming musicalityat once brisk and relaxed.

But Beethoven is by now familiar in this guiseand Mr. Norrington's snappyrigid approach can disappoint those who yearn for more grandeur and flexibility. One of the natural horn players was having troubletooand while Fisher Hall is far superior in its acoustical liveliness to Carnegie for such music-makingthe performances still lacked impact.

 111,  2019, a, Sanders and Warren had the sharpest messages

The race’s two leading progressivesMr. Sanders and Ms. Warrendominated Tuesday night’s debate by defending their uncompromising vision against more moderate ideas. Over and overas centrist candidates argued that Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren’s policies were impracticalthey made their case that Mr. Trump was not the root of America’s illsand advocatedas Ms. Warren calls it“bigstructural change.”

They were helped by two factors. They had significantly more name recognition — and support in the polls — than the people who were attacking themincluding former Representative John Delaney of Maryland and former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado. With them as a foilMr. Sanders and Ms. Warren were able to more easily remain above the fray. Howeverthere is also an ease in defending the progressive visionbecause it is aspirational. While other candidates are forced to argue about political possibilities and moderationthe two senators can think bigger and bolderand ask the audience to do the same.

The hard question for bothwhich they have avoided on the debate stage to this pointinvolves how they would pass their policies in a polarized Washington. And many Democrats remain worried that a message of radical change could be perilous in a general electionnoting that moderates had a strong track record in the 2018 midterms and that Mr. Obama and President Bill Clinton came from the center of the party.

 1666,  2009, a, Mario Perez/ABC

Last weekwe found ourselves marveling at the work of Sterling Beaumonthe 13-year-old actor on “Lost” who plays the junior version of Benjamin Linusthe show’s resident genius of ambiguous morality (whose grown-up incarnation is played by Michael Emerson). A few days laterin a crazy twist of fate involving time travelsmoke monsters and a helpful publicistwe found ourselves on the phone with the young actor. In this conversation with Sterling (which may contain spoilers for the uninitiated)he spoke with us about the polarizing “Lost” cliffhanger he was involved in last weekand ended up quizzing us about what we think is taking place on the show.

How were you cast to play Young Ben on “Lost”?

I went through like three auditionsand the first one was with the casting directorApril Webster. And I guess I did really goodbecause she said right in the room“OhI’m going to want to bring you back to the producers and writers.” They took a week or soand then they decidedyeahwe want you as this characterYoung Ben. But this is way back in season 3. So then it evolved from season 3 to season 5.

Were you a fan of “Lost” at the time?

NoI actually wasn’t watching the show. I actually hated the show before I was on it. [laughs] Because I was on another show on ABCcalled “In Case of Emergency,” and my episode that I guest-starred on kept on getting pre-emptedbecause of “Lost.”

What did you think about the grown-up version of Ben?

The only episode I had watched in season 3 was my episodewhen it aired. So we waited on season 3 to come out on DVD before watched the rest. Then I thought he was a total jerk. But nowafter season 4I think he has a method to his madness.

Which is…?

I have no ideabut I think he’s a good guy in the end. He always has a planand it hasn’t turned out that badlylately. And of course now that we know that the people on the freighter were not exactly the greatest people in the worldit just seems like maybe he really did save them.

Are you asked to base your performance on Michael Emerson?

My first episode of season 5Jack Bender [a “Lost” director and executive producer] told me“Don’t act like Ben. It will ruin what’s to come.” You have to have a little bit of him in therebecause that’s totally impractical for him to change 150 percent. So I have a little bit of him in therebut he’s a nicesweetinnocent kid. But he’s a very devious kid.

How is he devious?

Uhhe blew up a house.

Good point. Was it at all difficult for you to film the very brutal cliffhanger that concluded last week’s episode?

Ohit was so much fun. I was so excited.

Really?

Yes. In facteverybody had a controversy with a kid getting shot on TV. But I didn’t careand neither did my mom. I found it funny.

It was controversial on the set?

Nothey had to do it in the script. But everybody nowafter the episode was airedeverybody online or everybody that I talk to is freaking out. They saidThey can’t shoot a kid!

But you were comfortable doing it?

I’m fine with it. As long as it makes the show have better ratingsI’m cool.

Was it hard for you to watch it later?

OhI love watching that scene. It’s so much fun. Somebody has it up on YouTubeand I copied in and put it on my MySpace page.

Are you at all like Ben in real life?

Not too much. I meanI have my secrets. [laughs]

I suppose it would be silly to ask what those secrets are.

Yeah. And most of them are about the show. I’m curious — do you think Ben is alive?

Wellhe grows up to become an adultso he must be — right?

Ah. You think he becomes an adult. Nowthis is just from watchingif you listen back to when the Losties first meet up with the Dharma peoplewhen Miles asked Daniel Faraday“Heywe don’t get involvedright?” And Daniel Faraday says“It doesn’t matter nowwe’re stuck in this timewe’re going to change something.” So they’re changing time. Don’t forgetway back in season 2we saw Ben without his shirt onand there was no scar.

Are you becoming more recognizable at school for your television work?

Not any morebecause I don’t go to regular school any more. Because “Lost” was going to take up so much timemy school said you can’t miss that muchyou’re going to have to go to a home-school program.

Do you like that as much as going to a regular school?

I’m liking it. It’s a lot harderbecause you’re basically teaching yourself. That part’s hard about it.

Is that how evil geniuses are created?

I think it would be a good way.

 1147,  2012, a, When Stone Phillipsformerly of “Dateline NBC,” learned of a first-of-its-kind study in 2011 at Virginia Tech about the magnitude of head impacts on youth football playershis journalistic instincts kicked in.

“I thought the study was really importantand I wanted to get it out there,” he said.

So Mr. Phillipswho sustained two concussions as a high school and college football playerbegan reportingand he eventually paid to produce his own news report about the subject. The reportabout 14 minutes long and featuring his on-camera interviews with researcherswould not have looked out of place on “Dateline,” where he was a co-anchor until 2007. But instead he posted it on his own barebones Web siteStonePhillipsReports.com. The report compares youth football players who are battered by tackles to “bobblehead dolls.”

Nowin a twist that may reveal something about the way the media world works these daysMr. Phillips’s online reportcalled “Hard HitsHard Numbers,” is being used for television. On Monday nightPBS is scheduled to show a slightly condensed version on the “NewsHour,” its flagship nightly newscast. His title will be special correspondent.



The show picked up the report after Linda Winslowthe “NewsHour” executive producerwas told about the Phillips Web site by Neal Shapirothe president of the PBS station WNET in New Yorkwho ran NBC News for a time when Mr. Phillips was there. For Mr. Phillipsit was just a happyif unexpectedturn of events. “I did not have any plans for it to be broadcast,” he said. “I was perfectly happy to have it be on the Web site.”

PBS wound up covering a portion of his out-of-pocket expenses.

For the reportwhich was his first since leaving “Dateline,” Mr. Phillips hired a freelance television crew that he had used in the past. After the interviews were recorded in Virginiaa freelance editor came to Mr. Phillips’s home in a New York City suburb and set up his professional editing software in the home office to stitch the report together. Mr. Phillips subsequently cut about two minutes from it for Monday’s broadcast.

Mr. Phillips said he would be tackling a couple of other topics for his Web site in the futureincluding one on mental health and one on reading disabilities. But he will produce the projects on his own timetable. “The great thing about the Web,” he said“is that I can do it the way I want to do it.”

Goestenkors has labored for years to build the women's program to the level of the men'sand her Blue Devils are on the verge of becoming a national power alongside Connecticut and Tennessee. She called the sellout ''a long time coming for this arena.''

The players hope a victoryand a national title this seasonwill keep the fans coming.

''Every year you see the fan support increaseslowly but surely,'' the junior forward Iciss Tillis said. ''It takes time. We haven't won a national championship yet. Something like that really will help fans come in. We just feel like if the students come and watch us playthey'll find us just as exciting as the guys.''

This game is not lacking for drama. Aside from the matchup of undefeated teamsthere is the possibility of an individual battle that may help determine whether Alana BeardDuke's guard/forwardor Diana TaurasiUConn's guardis voted the national player of the year.

Beyond thatConnecticut Coach Geno Auriemma has stirred the Cameron Crazies into a froth. Auriemma has been taking shots at Duke for monthshis latest biting comments coming in a conference call with reporters on Thursday.

BERNESwitzerlandJuly 31 -- Crop prospects in Central and Southeastern European countries are ostensibly viewed more favorably in German official quarters as harvesting approaches and a report issued by the Dienst Aus Deutschlanda semi-official news agencypredicts that the yield throughout those areas will exceed the averages of 1940-41. View Full Article in Timesmachine »
 2602,  2004, a, In the statement accompanying the interest rate increasethe central bank acknowledged that the economy showed strengthand it ended by saying that it would ''respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.''

But many view the Fed's extremely measured approach to curbing inflationwhich is running at a rate of 2.9 percent so far this yearas a mistake. Paul Kasrieldirector of economic research at the Northern Trust Company in Chicagosaid such a tack allowed for too much inflationary pressure to build before meaningful brakes were finally applied.

Mr. Kasriel points to the past for evidence of what can happen when the Fed begins to raise rates well after inflation has taken hold. He identified two other periods during which the Fed began to increase rates when the Fed funds rate was in negative territoryadjusted for inflationas it is now. Each time -- in March 1971 and July 1980 -- inflation soon took off with a vengeance.

''Everyone recognizes that holding the Fed funds rate below the inflation rate is a recipe for accelerating inflation because it creates an incentive for people to go out and buy things and finance them at relatively low rates,'' Mr. Kasriel said. ''That act tends to drive the prices of those goods and services even faster. That was the predicament the Fed got itself into in the 1970's and spent a long time remedying. Now the Fed is in the early stages of squandering some of the gains that chairman Volcker made in eliminating inflation during the 80's.''

Mr. Kasriel said he thought the Fed would be forced to abandon its measured approach to interest rate increases early next year when inflation pressures become undeniable.

The stock market barely reacted to the rate increase; the Dow Jones industrial average closed the day up 22.05 points. Bonds ralliedpushing yields on the 10-year Treasury down to 4.58 from 4.69 on Tuesday.

Richard Bernsteinchief United States strategist at Merrill Lynchsaid he was surprised that investors seemed so optimistic about the Fed's move because corporate profits were no longer rising. A study of historyMr. Bernstein addedindicates that financial disruptions have followed periods when the Fed raised rates while corporate profits slowed.

 565,  2015, a, A number of people have been putting up candidates for chart of the year. For methe big chart of 2014 wasn’t actually from 2014 — it was from earlier work (pdf) by Branko Milanovicwhich I somehow didn’t see until a few months ago. It shows income growth since 1988 by percentiles of the world income distribution (as opposed to national distributions):

What you see is the surge by the global elite (the top 0.10.01etc. would be doing even better than his top 1)plus the dramatic rise of many but not all people in emerging markets. In between is what Branko suggests corresponds to the US lower-middle classbut what I’d say corresponds to advanced-country working classes in generalat least if you add post-2008 data with the effects of austerity. I’d call it the valley of despondand I think it’s going to be a crucial factor in developments over the next few years. More eventually.

 3327,  2000, a, That truism is reflected in the way the convention program is structured. Virtually all the major speeches this weekfrom those of Laura Bush and Gen. Colin L. Powell tonight and continuing with Senator John McCain and Elizabeth Dole on Tuesdaythe vice-presidential nomineeDick Cheneyon Wednesdayand Gov. George W. Bush on Thursdayare to take place between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. That just happens to be the hour each night that one or more of the over-the-air networks will be covering the Philadelphia proceedings live.

''Everything is geared for the 10 to 11 o'clock hour,'' said Tom Hannonthe political director of CNN. ''They're obsessed about getting their message across in the 10 to 11 hourand that is their driving concern. People say that the conventions are for cablebut as far as the parties are concernedthe conventions are for the most eyeballs they can get.''

Tonightthe Republicans got those eyeballsat least on ABCbut not exactly the program they had concocted. Like clockworkthe preseason football game -- begun an hour early to accommodate the convention coverage -- ended a few minutes before 10 p.m.paving the way for Peter Jennings to introduce several minutes of highlights before seguing about a third of the way into a speech by Laura Bush. CBS broke into its ''48 Hours'' program early with an update and returned at 10:30 to cover the final half-hour.

Viewers of ABC got a taste of what cable and PBS broadcast all night: an unusual showcase for multiculturalism. It was certainly the ''different'' sort of Republican evening the planners promised: videos of Gospel choirs and vignettes of inner-city school studentswho were used at times to underline the Bush campaign's promises of a more inclusive kind of Republicanism and to reinvigorate education reform.

Governor and Mrs. Bush -- the former appearing by satellite from a classroom in WestervilleOhio -- both spoke with backdrops consisting of children seated at desks. For Mrs. Bush's remarksABC even spliced in footage from a graduation ceremony in CrawfordTex.that the Bushes had attended.
 5255,  1988, a, Growing numbers of Vietnamese have been arriving in Hong Kong by boat in the past few monthscrowding into refugee camps with thousands of other Vietnamesemost of whom have only a slim chance of finding new homes outside the chain-link fences of the bleak compounds.

So far this yearmore than 1,500 Vietnamese refugeesmost of them poor farmers and fishermen from north Vietnamhave landed in Hong Kongfour times the number of arrivals during the same period last yearaccording to Govennment figures.

Waves of refugees have been arriving in Thailand and Malaysia as welland the Thai authorities have pushed some boats back out to sea.

Hong Kong has so far resisted such an extreme measurebut a recent newspaper survey revealed that 65 percent of those polled here want any new refugee boats turned away. And the Governor of this British colonySir David Wilsonsaid last week that Hong Kong is reconsidering its policy of allowing all boat people to land. 'Compassion Fatigue'

 124,  2019, a, Since its inceptionFOIA has rightly been denounced as a weak and ineffective lawbut The Times continues to aggressively pursue documents through the statutedoing what we have done repeatedly over the past 15 years: going to court to challenge the government’s refusal to release materials that the public should see. The Times has brought more FOIA suits over the last decade than any other mainstream media organization in the country.

A study by the nonprofit group TRAC found that The Times had filed 31 FOIA lawsuits during the Obama years. Our peer news organizations around the country — the major newspaperswire services and broadcasters — filed 10collectively. A subsequent TRAC study found that The Times continued to be the leading filer among media organizations over the first year and a half of the Trump administration. The Times has now filed 27 FOIA lawsuits in the Trump years. (A handful of public interest groups and newer media outletsin particular BuzzFeed and the Center for Public Integrityhave also been out front in pursuing litigation.)

So why do we devote so much time to trying to make a deeply flawed law work?

It’s not because it’s easy. Our FOIA litigation is done in house by our now three-lawyer teamwith our First Amendment Fellow Al-Amyn Sumar playing the pivotal role. We have been helped in several cases by a FOIA clinic at Yale Law School. We spend hundreds of hours each year filing the suitswriting briefsnegotiating with government lawyers and going to court. We know better than anyone that FOIA cases are frustrating; the deck is stacked against usand the lawsuits drag on for months and years.

But one part of our motivation is pretty simple: We manage to win documents. Between successful court decisionsand settlements in which the agencies agree to reverse course and give us documentswe regularly make a small dent in governmental secrecy.

In the past yearwe have assisted our reporters in unlocking documents on topics ranging from gun control and herbicides to foreign lobbyists and federal land disputes in the West. In JuneThe Times published a report about Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao’s efforts to include her relatives in meetings during an official trip to China in October of 2017. Emails obtained through a FOIA lawsuit showed that the trip had been canceled after ethics concerns were raised with officials in the State and Transportation Departments.

Many of us who grew up savoring the subversive humor and psychological sophistication of the early “Peanuts” comics have had to confront the question: When did it go bad? When did it lose its edge and become a maudlin “Happiness is a warm puppy” Hallmark sentiment?

The story offers a glimpse inside Charles Schulz’s complicated relationship with his characters and with his own success. — Carolyn Ryan

 3999,  1996, a, John Huston was walking toward history at the Memorial Tournament todayfollowing his perfect tee shot down the 17th fairway at Muirfield Village. Behind him was the flaming wreckage of the golf course that he had already torched for 10 birdies and an eagle. In front of himif he could add just one more birdie in the final two holeswas the all-time PGA Tour scoring record of 59.

He was laughingjoking with his caddiejust as a man with a large belly and a bigger voice yelled"Somebody go get Jack Nicklaus out here'cause this course is just too easy."

Huston smiled. He was thinking about the record nowand it was funnybecause the way he was playing golfMuirfield Village did seem easy. He had only to hit a 9-iron from 142 yards somewhere in the vicinity of the flag and make the putt. Thenif he parred 18he would join Al Geiberger and Chip Beckthe only players to break the 60 barrier. Geiberger shot a 59 in 1977 in the Memphis Classic; Beck did it in the Las Vegas Invitational in 1991.

That was probably the moment the spell was broken. You don't talk about no-hitters and you don't think about 59's. The 9-iron shot drifted and bounced into the deep right bunker. Huston hit an exquisite bunker shotdeftly killing the speed of the ball in the fringe and allowing it to trickle two and a half feet from the hole.

The studyby John M. Collinssenior specialist in national defense with the Library of Congress's Congressional Research Servicesays that quantitative changes in American and Soviet armed forces favor the Soviet Unionwith scattered exceptions. The document also contends that American intercontinental missiles are increasingly vulnerable to Soviet attack.

Attention has been focused on the report as a result of recent allegations in Congress that the document had been “suppressed” because it conflicts with the generally optimistic Administration view of the United States ‐Soviet military balance. The study was placed in the Congressional Record last month by Senator Jesse A. HelmsRepublican of North Carolina.

Mr. Collins has also been informed that his future work must be reviewed by a group of designated peers.

The landlordthe Green Door Realty Corporationoffered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the offenderand was not considered a suspect in the blaze.

The tenants were able to return to their apartments yesterday. As they went back into the buildingwith its shattered windowsits beige walls now black with soot and its tile floors littered with plaster from crumbling ceilingsthey spoke with anger and frustrationdemanding that the arsonist be foundarrested and jailed. Most were immigrants from the Dominican Republic who paid $500 to $600 a month for three-bedroom apartments in what they described as a poor and crime-ridden neighborhoodand many worried that their plight would soon be forgotten or ignored.

"This is the ghetto and we're minoritiesbut we work hard here and we're not garbage," sobbed Maria Cerdaa 50-year-old office worker who said she knew the women and children injured in the fire. "These peoplewhoever did thiswherever they arethey have to be punished. We want justice."

The eight victims of the blazefive of whom were critically injuredincluded Carmen Delgado35and her two daughtersGisnel Guzman5and Alondra Guzman2who lived on the sixth flooraccording to relatives and the Fire Department. Sometime before the fireMs. Delgado had blocked the entrance to the fire escape with a wooden doorfirefighters saidperhaps hoping to prevent burglars from breaking into the apartment. But it also blocked their only escape route.
 6066,  1977, a, WASHINGTON. June 30—The Carter Administration is developing a contingency energy conservation programincluding such mandatory provisions as gasoline rationingimport quotas and forced closings of service stationsAdministration officials said today.

The two‐pronged program would attempt to deal on one level with emergency problems that would occur in another oil embargo or other form of supply interruption. Perhaps more importantthe program could function as a permanent allocation systemto be used if the energy measures now under consideration in Congress fail to solve the nation's energy problem.

Both the emergency and the nonemergency purposes of the program grew out of increasing fears that world supplies of oil and natural gas might grow increasigly tight by the 1980'sdespite the Administration's current effortsand that the balance of energy power might shift even more precipitously to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting countries.

This has prompted within the Administration a renewed conviction that a more foreceful emergency plan is needed because of the nation's growing dependence on imported oil. Imported oil has grown from 39 percent of domestic consumption in 1975 to 44 percent in 1976.

 6241,  1973, a, The Cardinals are the principal advisers to the Pope in the government of the church. They form the Sacred College of Cardinalswhich has often been called the Senate of the church. Howeversince Ecumenical Council Vatican II met from. 1962 to 1965Pope Paul has created a new advisory bodythe Bishops' Synod. This groupmade up of bishops —some of them cardinals—from all over the worldlast met in the Vatican in the autumn of 1971. It is due to hold its next meeting in the coming year.

The most important task of the Sacred College of Cardinals is governing the church collectively as an interim administration during the period of the vacancy of the Holy See after the death of a pope and to elect a new pontiff.

When the 30 new cardinals join the college next monthit will have a record membership of 145. If the college were called to elect a new pope by that time and no changes occur during the next 31 days116 cardinals — including all the new ones—would be entitled to take part in the conclave.

Pope Paul ruled in November1970that cardinals who have reached their 80th years might no longer participate in the election of a new head of the church. Howeverthere is no age limit for eligibility to the papacy. This means thattheoreticallya cardinal who is over 80 may be elected pope.

Pope Paul is understood to be considering a reform of the papal election system by which some bishops who are not cardinals and possibly some selected priests would join the conclave. However:several conservative cardigals are known to be opposed such an innovationand it does not seem likely in the near future.

RIO DE JANEIRO — L.A.T.I.the Italian owned and operated air line which is the only trans-Atlantic link between the Rome-Berlin Axis and the Western Hemispherecompleted its first year of operations today [Dec. 23]. In spite of the war in Europeit is still making weekly flights with land planes between Rome and Rio de Janeiro. It is an important linefor by it the Axis reaches South American countries and the United States without running the risk of confiscation or censorship at a British control station.

The New York Herald Tribune has been able to obtain precise information about the operation of L.A.T.I.especially in the months since Italy’s entrance into the war on June 10when France was collapsing. Since that day there have been thirteen westbound flights on which the line has carried a total of nine passengersfive tons of mail and five and a half tons of cargo valued at $100,922.48. There have been only two disasters since the service was inaugurated. — New York Herald TribuneEuropean EditionJan. 21941

 1465,  2010, a, Sarah Palinthe former Alaska governorhas waded into another Republican primarythis time endorsing Rand Paul’s Kentucky Senate campaign.

In a statement released MondayMs. Palin said she was “proud to support great grassroots candidates like Dr. Paul,” an ophthalmologist and son of Representative Ron Paulthe Texas Republican and 2008 presidential candidate.

“While there are issues we disagree onhe and I are both in agreement that it’s time to shake up the status quo in Washington and stand up for common sense ideas,” Ms. Palin added.

For his partDr. Paul on Monday touted the leadership of Ms. Palinwho is scheduled to give the keynote address at the National Tea Party Convention this week. “I will strive to capitalize on the support of Governor Palin and so many others to go to Washington and fight for liberty and limited government,” said Dr. Paulhimself a favorite among Tea Party activists.

Dr. Paul is locked in a primary battle with Trey GraysonKentucky’s secretary of statein the race to succeed retiring Republican Jim Bunning. Mr. Grayson has received support fromamong othersMitch McConnellthe state’s senior senator and the Republican leader in the Senate.

Ms. Palin’s endorsement comes not long after she announced she will campaign for Texas Gov. Rick PerryArizona Senator John McCain and Representative Michele Bachmann. Mr. Perrywho is seeking a third full termfaces Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison in a high-profile primarywhile Mr. McCain could face a tough challenge from the right.

The Times’s Ian Urbina took a closer look at Dr. Paul’s candidacy last Novemberfinding that the novice candidate with a libertarian streak was “capitalizing on a hearty distrust of government and an anti-Republican-establishment fervor among conservatives” to raise a large campaign war chestlargely over the Internet.

 4114,  1995, a, Mark Everett's credentials as a runner are superb.

He has five national outdoor titles in the last seven years at 800 meters and two national titles indoors in the last three years at 500 meters. He is the third-fastest American ever at 800 meters (1 minute 43.40 seconds) behind Johnny Gray (1:42.60) and David Mack (1:43.25). And he is ranked third in the world in the 800 behind only Wilson Kipketer and Patrick Konchellahboth of Kenya.

Yetwhen Everett steps to the line for the men's 800 in the Chemical Bank Millrose Games on Friday at Madison Square Gardenmany people may not remember himdespite his six Millrose titles (three at 500 metersthree at 600 yards) in six races. Everetthowevermay be recalled for the races in which he finished far behind less-gifted runnersthe races in which he seemed unfocused and uncaring.

Everett says he understands. He also says the 26-year-old Mark Everett you see now is different.

"I'm older and wiser," he said last week. "I have a coach nowJ. J. Clark. I got married in Octoberwhich helps a lot. Everybody knows that when you marryit stabilizes youor tears you up a lot."

The one who tore him up in the past was himself. OftenEverett would lope far backthen roar past rivals who had written him off. And his unsophisticated tactics (or lack of tactics) made him look bad even when he succeeded.
 1853,  2008, a, Wei Weivisiting New York from the Michael Schultz Gallery in Beijingshowed up on Tuesday morning at the blocklong Barnes & Noble on the Avenue of the Americasbetween 21st and 22nd Streetsin the old Ladies’ Mile shopping district.



He was looking for monographs of Sam FrancisKeith HaringJames Rosenquist and Frank Stellawhose work the gallery plans to exhibit. His hotel had recommended this particular Barnes & Noble for the strength of its art section.

But Mr. Wei was late. About 18 hours late. The 35,000-square-foot storeamong the larger units in the chainclosed on Monday evening after 14 years in business.

“I had heard some bad things about the U.S. economy,” Mr. Wei saidwondering whether this was somehow connected to the foreclosure crisis.

Noit had to do with — wellyou can imagine what it had to do with.

“In anticipation of the lease coming upwe tried negotiating with the landlord,” said Mitchell S. Klipperchief operating officer of Barnes & Noble. “The brokers came in and put crazy numbers in their minds. We can’t pay those kinds of rents. We’ve been looking twothree years for a replacement. We have not been able to find a suitable location at rents that are affordable.”

Mr. Klipper said that “nobody likes closing stores — trust me,” and added that most of the employees in Chelsea had been transferred to the Union Square or TriBeCa branches. (The Astor Place store also recently closed.)

Mr. Klipper recalled signing the lease 15 years ago when that stretch of Sixth Avenue was just beginning to wake up from a long slumber. “We were very concerned whether anybody would shop there,” he said. “When we cameit put a foothold in the area. The next big box came and the next big box came.”

And that’s what the landlord is looking foraccording to the sign in the window: “Big Box Retail.” Ideas have already surfaced on the Racked blog.

Where plate glass windows beckoned browsers as recently as last weekendthere now hang rolls of kraft paperintended to block the view of passers-by. But this shield is not seamlessand one can glimpse slices of the interior. The décor is standard B&N issuethough it is ennobled here by colossal columns from the days in the early 20th century when this was the Adams Dry Goods emporium.

Familiar as the store looksit now seems poignantly remotea relic from another age.

Is it possible? Have things taken such a turn in Manhattan that we are growing nostalgic for Barnes & Noble; the big bully that was once so easy to blame for the demise of the neighborhood bookshop?

A middle-aged woman who passed by the locked doors on Tuesday after Mr. Wei departed — a neighborto judge from the blue laundry cart she had in tow — delivered her own brief eulogy. “It’s the saddest thingisn’t it?” she asked.

 4829,  1991, a, In bringing on a couple identified as Nelson and Winnie Mandelathe movie seemed to promise that these pooh-bahs were in for ittoo -- and at least one of them is eminently vulnerable. But no. Mrs. Mandela's association with youths who apparently went in for blood sports was not mentioned. And there was no gag about Mr. Mandela being henpecked.

The Mandelas are protected by raceas humor-proof a vest as is available these days. It takes a target like the Rev. Al Sharpton to bring out the darts of ridicule. One of the few funny spots in the messy movie version of "The Bonfire of the Vanities" was the appearance of a portlygussied-up rabble-rouser whose resemblance to the Reverend Sharpton was sheercathartic ridicule. At the moment heavy indignation is being directed at Dr. Leonard Jeffries Jr.the chairman of the African-American studies department at City Collegefor his unflattering remarks about JewsItalians and whites in general. But demands for his demotion endow him with seriousness. For the thoroughgoing ridiculistnobody is all that seriousand hereif anywhereis a figure whose theories might easily be grist for mockerybut never in prime time.

The number of excluded subjects continues to grow. On the tube these days all groups are taken pretty much at their own estimate; more and more subjects are handled with a tenderness that can bring on queasiness.

Grantedthere is nothing funny about abortionrapeAIDShomelessness or the Holocaustbut should that exempt activists on all sides from ridicule? And do all programs on those subjects -- and there are many -- have to be so holier than thou? Each exhalation of Elie Wiesel is received by interviewers as coming from Moses on the mountain. Even to make such an observation opens one to a charges of gross insensitivity to a 20th-century tragedybut can't one differentiate between the fact of the Holocaust and its exploitation?

Isn't there something worth ridiculing in the way public televisionthat fount of responsibilitytreats Indianspro-choicers and all other politically correct groups with the same reverence that it gives to whales.

Beware. When Joseph Epsteinthe editor of The American Scholarwas exposed as having made rude jokes about feminists and lesbiansJoyce Carol Oates demanded his resignation. (The jokes were written for The Hudson Reviewa publication presumably read by sophisticated people; hearing them uttered on television is unimaginable.)

To mock truly divisive issues and exquisitely sensitive groups requires a respect for the maturity of the mass audience that has never been earnedor at least a hope that the level of maturity might be raised -- and who wants to take a chance on that? So the medium can be expected to tread carefullyavoid offense and so make its contribution to public order and even to good feelings. The gain is by no means negligiblebut the price is a humorless leveling of political discourse. The loss can be measured in the light and the light-heartedness that ridicule might bring to a dreary political time.

 3256,  2000, a, Cybershop.coman Internet retailer that decided to close its principal Web site after disappointing sales at the end of last yearsaid yesterday that it had a loss of $4.4 millionor 50 cents a sharein the final quarter of last year.

Jeffrey Tauberthe company's chairman and chief executivesaid in a conference call with investors that he was very excited about the company's new directionwhich involves its effort to become an ''Internet incubator'' that will help promising young companies.

Mr. Tauber and his family sold $7 million of stock in Novemberat prices from $10 to $10.61 a share. He defended those sales in the conference call yesterdaysaying they were proper and came at a time when he expected that ''December results would be quite strong,'' although they turned out to be so disappointing that the company decided to close its original venturecybershop.com. Shares of Cybershop.com fell 93.75 cents yesterdayto $3.9375 in Nasdaq trading before the financial results were released.

Mr. Tauberin a telephone interviewsaid there was no reason for the company to have disclosed in November that sales of its cybershop.com Web site had fallen in the third quarter. He said that disclosuremade in an amended filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last weekwas required only because the company had later decided to discontinue the operation.

Mr. Bauman created many of his early dances for Dance Theater Workshopan informal loft theater when he founded it in 1965 with Jeff Duncan and Jack Mooreboth of whom have since died. The organizationwhich he helped to direct until 1975later became one of the city's major dance institutions.

Mr. Bauman began choreographing in 1962 and became known for painstakingly planned mixed-media collagist dances that were often designed to be performed in specific theater spaces.

He said that it should scotch criticism that the project of landing man on the moon by 1970 was suffering from lack of information about the physical condition of the lunar surface.

In additionMr. Dillon has told investigators that similar trades based on the Business Week articles were made through accounts held in the name of Mr. Dillon's motherElizabeth Bairdand one of his friendsFrancis Roche. It is not clear whether his mother and Mr. Roche made the trades themselves.

The account in Ms. Baird's name was maintained through the retail brokerage Quick & Reilly Groupthe investigators said. The account in Mr. Roche's name was kept at the Charles Schwab Corporation. Both accounts were maintained through branches in Connecticut.

There was no answer at the telephone in Mr. Roche's home. Ms. Baird did not return a message left with a woman who answered her home telephone. Mr. Dillon did not return a phone message left on his answering machine at home. California Plant Involved

The second Donnelley plantbased in VenturaCalif.became part of the investigation as a result of trades made through the Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. branch in nearby Anaheim.

Officials from Prudential said that one Donnelley employee at the plant apparently traded on information from Business Week articles through an account at the Anaheim branch. The brokerage on Friday dismissed Brian Callahanthe broker who oversaw the accountafter the account was suspended.

Also under investigation by the S.E.C. are a second stockbroker at Merrill's New London brancha stockbroker at Advest Inc. in New London and three former brokers from the Hartford office of E.F. Hutton & Company.

 2138,  2007, a, I never thought there was going to be any sort of nostalgia for childhood in the 1970sa time of skyrocketing divorce“latch key kids” and newly liberated adults who sometimes behaved rather badly toward their much less with-it offspring.

Yet nowwith middle age encroaching upon the girls who cut their hair like Dorothy Hamill and carried lunchboxes that sported the face of the original Bionic Womanthe seventies are coming back to lifeand looking a whole lot better in retrospect.

Last monthAmerican Girl introduced Julie of 1974the latest doll in the company’s “historical” linewith a set of accompanying bookswritten by the children’s author and seventies girl Megan McDonald and filled with fun facts about Shirley Chisholmthe ERATitle IXBillie Jean King and the etymology of Ms.

This week came “The Daring Book for Girls,” the work of two almost-middle-aged writers whose goalthey told mewasn’t just to complement the mega blockbuster “The Dangerous Book for Boys,” but also to offer an escape route out of the high-pressureperfectionistmedia-saturated and competitive world of girlhood in our time. The way they do it: by offering up an alternative kind of girl culture that looks and sounds a whole lot like … life in the 1970s.



“The Daring Book for Girls” teaches the art of playing jacks and handclap gamesroller skatingdartsjump ropegin rummy and daisy chains. There’s fun and old-fashioned feminism: “Putting Your Hair Up With a Pencil” and “A Short History of Women Inventors and Scientists.” Instead of e-mailinstant messaginggroup weigh-ins or slumber parties organized around “America’s Next Top Model,” the authors offer instructive chapters on “Clubhouses and Forts,” “Writing Letters,” “Telling Ghost Stories” and “Fourteen Games of Tag.”

There’s “How to Negotiate A Salary,” “Every Girl’s Toolbox,” “Public Speaking” and “Finance: InterestStocks and Bonds” (favorites of mine). My daughter Julia – a target “tween” – went wild over “Reading Tide Charts,” “Vinegar and Baking Soda” and “Making a Willow Whistle.”

“We looked at what we ourselves enjoyed doing,” said author Andrea J. Buchanan. “We asked ourselves: what should girls know?” added co-author Miriam Peskowitz. “And we went from there.”

Unlike “The Dangerous Book for Boys,” which harkens back to a prelapsarian state of boyhood that some have dated to the 1950s and others to Edwardian England“The Daring Book for Girls” can’t be too backward-looking. After allthe 1950s weren’t really a heyday for girl power. The 1970stooBuchanan and Peskowitz acknowledgedhad their frustrations and limitations for the girls on the very cusp of social change. But the era of their girlhoodthe authors believewasoverallless toxic.

“Girls have more opportunities now,” Peskowitz said. “But the culture is more horrid. Girls jump into womanhood at nine. It may have been more fun in some ways to have been a girl in 1963 or 1973 without the pressures.”

“The Dangerous Book for Boys” spent 20 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list and is slated to become a Disney film. If the “Daring” book does anywhere nearly as wellthen it could mark the start of a pop culture re-imagining of modern girlhood – oneperhapswith an emphasis on doing rather than seemingon growing rather than shrinkingand on exploring rather than shutting down.

That would be nice. If only.

If onlywith its faux-antique bindingblack and white etchingsand Girl Scout Handbook-like straightforwardness“Daring” didn’t have the persistent feel of a reliquary. If only my own tween’s enthusiasm for it (“Will you help me put up my hair with a pencil?”) weren’t a sign that it’s not going to play well with the Hannah Montana crowd. If only my own admiration for it wasn’tpretty muchthe kiss of death: the Geek seal of approval. (“Girls,” I breathedmisty-eyedin the car recently. “Just think: one day you’ll have a lot of homework and we can all go to the library together and share a table!”)

Peskowitzwho has a Ph.D. in ancient history and religionmay find it a thrill to apply her professional knowledge to teaching girl readers about “Queens of the Ancient World.” Other mothers may find similar ways to communicate the passions of their lives – poetryor chemistryor camping — to their girls via the “Daring” book’s pages. Yetwhile all this will undoubtedly strengthen individual mother-daughter bondsI wonder if it will have any wider effect. What power can any of us – moms and daughtersadrift in the cultural mainstream — have against the hugely seductivehypnotic machine that has brought us ParisMileyLindsay and more?

Not much — unless there are a whole lot more of us out there than I think.

A family counselor I heard speak last Spring said she believes that young girls today who get caught up in skinninessfashionpopularitypop culture and boys areessentially“underemployed.” Their brainsshe saidneed to be engaged by things larger than themselves: things like hobbiessportsartmusic or community service. If they’re notthere’s a vacuumand all kinds of wretched stuff comes to fill their minds instead.

I thought of this woman’s words on Halloweencatching glimpses trick or treating of the tweens dressed in this year’s much-talked-about “bawdy” attire or simply in costumes that were more fashion-y than fun. These girls were striking. There was a self-consciousness to theman inward-turnednessthat was joylessand disturbing. It was way too adult-like and way too heavy a thing for their young and (invariably) skinny shoulders to bear.

I don’t know exactly how we can relieve them of the burdens of toxic girlhood. We can’t – and shouldn’t – raise them in a total media vacuum. We can’t simply preach at themor badger themor cloister them or dress them in the kind of puppy-dotted turtlenecks that are now showing up in some nostalgia-stoking holiday catalogues.

The only thing we can do is provide some sort of inspiration – of a kind of womanhood that makes them want to connect to the better aspects of the girlhood we once knew. And thengive them the space and the time to make it their own.
 47,  2019, a, We arrived at the border at CalexicoCalif.on Dec. 31. Despite appealing for helpI was turned away by the Border Patrol agents. Desperate to reunite our familyI found us a way across in the early morning hours of Jan. 1.

We were caught by agents after we crossed and taken to one of the detention centers known as “hieleras,” or iceboxesbecause they are kept so cold. There I learned that Kevin was taken to the same detention center with Grethshell and she had been separated from her father . Two fellow migrant women told me that five agents held him down while they ripped her from his arms. Other migrant women were asked to watch her.

When I and my two other children were released on Jan. 2my uncle confirmed what the women had told me. Kevin was charged with a felony for returning to the United States after having been deported. He was taken to jailwhile our daughter was sent to a shelter for migrant children in San Antonio.

The family separation was not reported to the court on his charging documents. The charges against him were droppedbut Immigration and Customs Enforcement is still using those initial charges as an excuse to keep him detained indefinitely while he fights for asylum.

I was told I would be reunited with my daughter in a weekbut first I needed to fill out paperwork. Then I was told to provide a credit card with up to a $4,000 credit line for her flightan impossibility for me. Officials refused to say who was looking after her. Finally I got fed up and went to the press. Grethshell was finally put on a plane and brought to me after I threatened to go to the address I had for the shelter manager and get her myself.

When a social worker put my daughter in my arms on Jan. 30she was inconsolable. My whole body shook as I held her and tried to soothe hertelling her that everything would be O.K. She was so sick I had to take her to the doctor the next day. For three weeks she resisted mefearfulwhen I tried to hold her. She still cries out for her father at night.

I know I am not alone. There are around 311,000 immigrants who have requested asylum after escaping violence in their home countries like us. Our future is uncertain. My children and I were just evicted from the home we shared with six other people. I’m trying to survive as a single mother of three. I don’t know if we’ll be granted asylum or sent back to our deaths at the hands of the gangs.
 2221,  2006, a, It is payout time for managing directors of Greenhill & Company.

Nearly two years after the boutique investment bank staged its initial public offeringGreenhill said in a press release Monday afternoon that it plans to file with securities regulators for a secondary offering of 4.025 million shares. The shares are all held by current and former managing directors of Greenhillthe company said.

Based on Monday’s closing price of $66.31the offering could raise nearly $267 million for the selling shareholders.

Greenhill’s stock has nearly quadrupled since May 2004when it sold 5 million shares to its underwriters at $17.50 apiece. But the stock had a rough day on Mondayfalling 6.5 percent on unusually high volume before the close of trading. The announcement about the secondary offering came shortly after 4 p.m. E.D.T.

Robert F. Greenhillwho founded Greenhill in 1996 and is its chairman and chief executiveown 6 million shares through various trusts he controlsor about 20.7 percent of the company’s equity. Scott BokGreenhill’s United States presidentand Simon Borrowsits non-U.S. presidenteach own nearly 1.9 million sharesregulatory filings show.

Greenhill still has not indicated which managing directors will be selling shares in the secondary and how many shares they will sell.

 4801,  1991, a, The suffering of the Iraqi people cries out for compassion. Shortages of foodmedicineclean water and electricity now threaten to cause more death and disease than the Persian Gulf war. Indeedthe worsening plight of Iraq's vulnerable children and powerless adults virtually demands some easing of the economic sanctions. Why make the Iraqi people suffer for the crimes of Saddam Hussein?

But the sanctions remain one of the few levers by which the allied coalition hopes to disarm Iraq's nuclearchemical and biological capabilities. As Iraq disdainfully evades international inspectorsthe allies know they need every bit of pressure they can muster.

There may be a way out of this dilemma: Permit Iraq to resume oil exportsbut impound the earnings and apply some of them to humanitarian assistance.

Satellite photos and defectors' reports make clear that Iraq continues to violate the terms of the United Nations cease-fire. Iraq supplied misleading accounts of its nuclear arms program and still tries to conceal arms-making equipment and facilities from international inspectors. As if to underscore reports that Washington is weighing military optionsPresident Bush says "all means necessary" may be used to enforce the cease-fire resolution. But bombing during the war did not succeed in eliminating Saddam Hussein's nuclear capacity.

 2931,  2002, a, American and Australian troops killed four suspected Taliban or Al Qaeda fighters along the Afghan frontier in the past two daysmilitary officials said todayas hundreds of allied troops under United States command swept the border area near Pakistan.

Military officials said that a force of fewer than 1,000 allied fighters had been working in and out of the border area for more than a week and that they had found large caches of weaponsbut few adversariesdespite the recent firefights.

The allied fighters include AfghansAmerican Special Forcestroops from the 101st Airborne Divisionand Australian and British special operations forces and Royal Marines.

A Pakistani intelligence official said a major American-led military operation would probably begin in the area around Khost in the next 24 hours. Pakistanthe official saidhad already been alerted to seal its border along Afghanistan's Paktia Province. An American communications and intelligence center had been set up in the tribal area on the Pakistani side to help coordinate the operationthe official said.
 3323,  2000, a, In a series of votes yesterdayIsrael's parliament made clear its uneasiness over peace talks with the Palestinians. But at the end of the dayPrime Minister Ehud Barak remains in office with a chance to revive the compromises discussed at the failed Camp David summit meetings if the Palestinian leaderYasir Arafatshows more flexibility on Jerusalem. Polls show that Israeli voters are far more willing than their elected representatives to support reasonable compromises as the price of a durable peace.

Parliament's biggest surprise was Moshe Katsav's upset of Shimon Peres for the largely ceremonial office of president. Mr. Peresa former prime minister and a winner of the Nobel Peace Prizewas an architect of the Oslo peace agreement with the Palestinians in 1993. He is one of the last active members of Israel's founding generation and has made great contributions to Israel's development and its survival during his six decades in political life.

Mr. Peres's presidential candidacy was backed by Mr. Barak's One Israel Party and seemed assured a majority. But he fell four votes short in the secret ballot election and lost to Mr. Katsava veteran of the conservative Likud Party. As presidentMr. Katsav will receive credentials from diplomatsissue pardons recommended by the government and carry out other honorary functions. Born in Iranhe is Israel's first president with non-European originsa welcome advance for a group long excluded from the top ranks of the Israeli political establishment.

Of more immediate political significance were two failed votes of no confidence in the Barak government. Various parties are unhappy with some of the concessions discussed at Camp Davidlike turning over up to 90 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian rule and allowing some Palestinian sovereignty within Jerusalem. But they could not muster the required 61 votesin part because these parties fear new elections would erode their current strength.
 4339,  1994, a, The Rangers are offering CRAIG MacTAVISH a hefty raise to stay with the Stanley Cup champions and pass up a chance to coach in the National Hockey League.

MacTavish35has been offered the coaching job with the Edmonton Oilersfor whom he played before being traded to the Rangers in March. GLEN SATHER would reportedly give up his coaching duties in Edmonton to concentrate on being general manager.

There have been quite a few rumors about him," BRUCE MacGREGORexecutive vice president and assistant general manager of the Oilerssaid yesterday about Sather. "There was a rumor here in the paper that NEIL SMITH offered him a two-year deal for $800,000 a year. How many of these rumors are trueI don't know. Craig had a conversation with Glen about being coach. But if he was offered that kind of moneyit's doubtful he'll be a coach. I think Glen has an interest.

"At one time in their conversationCraig indicated that coaching is something he would be interested in when he's done playing. As far as a contractI don't think they got that far into it."

 1611,  2010, a, There’s a neat trick at work in Joe Krozel’s puzzle: using the same clues for consecutive entries. He does this three times at the topin the middle and at the bottom.

Much like yesterday’s puzzleall these “givens” in the grid considerably restrict what can be done with the fill. Againthe results mostly belie that difficulty.

At 31 and 32 DownARTEL and BAHA’I aren’t the most mainstream entriesbut they should be familiar enough crossword fodder for many. WOTANacross the wayis a bit more obscure unlessof courseyou’re a fan of Wagner’s Ring Cycle.

Down belowextra credit goes to all who filled in NYASA and GOLGI without using all the crossers. Camillo Golgi was an Italian cytologist whose name has been lent to several microscopical methods and types of cells. He was mentioned just this week in The Times (last paragraph).

Before I hand things over to Mr. KrozelI’ll acknowledge a slight case of theme greediness. After finishing my solveI went back to analyze the pairs of like-clued entrieshoping to find different parts of speech for each pair. It did happen in four caseswhich I particularly appreciated. For example“Mean” was a noun for AVERAGE and a verb for SIGNIFY. Of courseasking the puzzle to do that for all nine pairson top of what it has already accomplishedwould be an adjective for “Mean” — inhuman.

Notes From Joe Krozel

I got the idea for today’s crossword from this puzzle by Matt Ginsberg in which pairs of 7-letter entries were anagrams of each other (I even used a similar grid layout). But more than thatI have Matt to thank for something else that made today’s puzzle possible; Matt had assembled a word database that he generously shared with his fellow constructors. Within that database is a feature that cross-references entries of the same length that have been clued with the exact same verbiage. So I scoured that list and manually extracted as many 7-letter entries that fit that description.

Finallysome solvers have remarked that constructors try to misdirect them by using clues that have two meanings … I suppose I’ve been caught red-handed!
 3816,  1997, a, Dennis Martinez gained his first victory at Yankee Stadium 11 days before Joe Torre got his first victory anywhere as a manager. Last nightTorre made it 1,000 as the Yankees edged the Seattle Mariners3-2and Martinez is still looking for No. 2 at Yankee Stadium.

''It doesn't seem that long agobut it was 20 years,'' Torre said of his first victorywith the Mets. ''We beat Montreal at Shea Stadium. Craig Swan. It was the first game I managed.''

Torre joined Bobby Cox and Tony La Russa as the only 1,000-game winners among active managersprimarily because David Wells pitched his best game with the Yankees. Wellsadmittedly growing weary of comparisons with Jimmy Keyscattered seven hitswalked none and struck out nine in seven and two-thirds innings. He was especially tough with runners on base.

''All I've been hearing for the last stinking week is we want Key back and all that,'' Wells said. ''People are going to say things. Let them say it and go on.''
 4574,  1992, a, The tipoff came when the Bush people said the speech would be a "defining moment." That was what they had called the gulf war this time last year -- a "defining moment" -- and now they were recycling it to ballyhoo a speech.

They didn't even have any new phrasesfor Pete's sake. How could they possibly have a new idea? Applying "defining moment" to that perennial brain-glazerthe State of the Union speechshould have told us how things stood: to witthat this outfit is so sure it's home safe for another four years that it doesn't even feel the need for fresh blustermuch less a fresh thought.

As if to flaunt his contentment with last year's crowd-grabbersthe President addressed the economic recession with the same chilling words he used after Saddam Hussein seized Kuwait: "This will not stand."

What does this mean? That the recession is going to get Schwarzkopfed unless it comes to its senses and clears out of America pronto? Of course not. It means"Prosperity is just around the corner."

 929,  2013, a, NEW ORLEANS — N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell suggested Friday that the league could use suspensions more often to enforce its crackdown on hits to the head. During the seasonthe league suspended Ravens safety Ed Reed for his third violation of rules prohibiting helmet-to-helmet hits on defenseless players. The suspension was overturned on appeal by Ted Cottrellan N.F.L. hearing officer.

“I think we’re going to have to continue to see discipline escalateparticularly on repeat offenders,” Goodell said. “It’s not just the playerthe defenseless playerthat’s being protected; it’s the person doing the striking. We see in the injury rates that the defenseless player and the defensive back are having a higher injury rate.”

When players keep violating the rulethey’re going to be taken off the fieldhe saidadding,“Suspension gets through to them.”

Goodell made the remarks during his annual state-of-the-league news conferencewhich was heavy with questions about player safety. It came one day after players union leadersat a Thursday news conferencechallenged the league on several player safety issues.



Union leaders said that they wanted a neutral chief safety officer to be appointed to hear appeals about acceptable levels of careand that an internal survey of players showed that most did not trust their team’s medical staff. The union offered no numbers from the survey.

Goodell sounded irritated by the union’s announcementsnoting two times that the league and union met for four hours last week — with players and owners in attendance — and the survey had not been raised by the unionan indication of the fractured relationship between the league and the players.

Among the other topics Goodell touched on:

He thinks the N.F.L. will have testing for human growth hormone for the 2013 season. The league and union agreed to start testing when the collective bargaining agreement was completed 18 months agobut since then they have sparred over the detailsand Congress has begun to apply pressure to get the agreement finished.

He said the league would look to set standards for the quality of playing fieldsprobably a reaction to the sloppy turf at FedEx Field.

He said his only regret from the Saints’ bounty scandal was his inability to get everyone — he singled out the union — to realize that bounties must be eliminated from the game.

GIANTS PUNTER’S DENIAL Mitch Rosswho told Sports Illustrated that he had given Baltimore linebacker Ray Lewis a spray form of deer antler extractcontaining a substance banned by the N.F.L.told reporters that he had also supplied other N.F.L. players with the sprayincluding Giants punter Steve Weatherford.

Weatherford denied the allegation in a message on Twitterwriting: “I have never used anything illegal in my life. Being a role model is too important to me. These claims are a marketing ploy.” Weatherford has consulted with a lawyerPeter Siachosabout Ross’s statements.

Lewis has also denied having used the substance.

 3691,  1998, a, To the Editor:

In ''The Picture of Bill Clinton'' (editorialAug. 23) you state that President Clinton has not harmed respect for the Presidency because Presidents FordCarter and Reagan had demonstrated that even the failures of Richard Nixon had not done permanent damage to the office of the President. Very obviously omitted from that list of Presidents since Nixon was President Bush.

George Bush brought honordignity and respect to the office of the Presidencyin the eyes of the American people and the world at large. I believe you owe your readers an apology and a correction for an editorial that has a glaring omission and could create an erroneous impression.

 590,  2015, a, Ten years and a lifetime agoL. Dennis Kozlowski reigned as the archetype of avarice. This helped lead to his conviction in 2005 for looting nearly $100 million from Tycofor which he served six and a half years in prison. That showy shower curtain was in his corporate residence on Fifth Avenue — paid for with Tyco funds — and came to symbolize a life of unabashed excess. Mr. Kozlowski wasn’t the only corporate executive of his era who was convicted for fraud and other wrongdoing. Some of the others include:

 5396,  1987, a, ''Certainly I wasn't in a hurry to run fast after last weekand with the world championships next week,'' Coghlan said. Last week he ran 2,000 meterslonger than a mile.

Of coursethe national-indoor-championships record crowd of almost 16,000 wasn't thinking about last week or next. They were hoping to see as fast a race as possible.

They weren't even to know how fast the mile was goinghowever. The scoreboard timer wasn't operating. Insteadall they saw was ''0:00'' on the board in the one event in which every fan is concerned about the time. Fans had to settle for calls after each quarter over the loudspeaker. But when the race was runno oneexcept those who had stopwatches and could use them accuratelyeven knew that Coghlan had eclipsed 4 minutes again.

Carl Lewis also conceded that he wasn't that concerned about speed -in facthe said he didn't even care about winning.

''This meet really has nothing to do with anything,'' he said.

''I just want to get on the 11:15 plane back home,'' he said after finishing third in the 55-meter dash. He failed to qualify on the American team for the world indoor championships.

''Even if I had,'' he said''the 55-meter to me is just a warm-up for the 100-meter outdoors. I ran indoors to work up my first 60 yards.'' Sour Grapes Attitude? Sour grapes? Perhaps. But he said he planned to start training again on Tuesday for the long jump (in which he captured one of four Olympic gold medals). He underwent arthroscopic knee surgery last November.

If there were other distractions for Sergei Bubkathe world's best pole-vaulterthey could not be discerned so easily. In the warm-ups he corrected the public-address announcer over how many times he had set world records. Bubka then passed a chance to leap at 17 feet 9 1/4 inchesat 18-1 1/4 and 18-5 1/4. The Soviet starthoughthen failed three times at 18-9 1/4. He refused to be interviewed later.

I've seen several situations -- also on airplanes -- in which parents acted as if they deserved special consideration because they were traveling with a child. One woman assumed she would receive her meal first; another assumed that the passenger sitting next to her wouldn't mind if her child lay down across both of their laps. Do I think the other airline passengers should accept a "collective responsibility" for those children? Hardly. Does this mean that I don't love children. Of course not. NANCY MUELLER Seattle

Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lessonstudents investigate how increased patriotism as a reaction to national crisis can serve as both a uniting and a dividing force. Students discuss their views on the issue and interview adults representing different generations to gauge their historical perspectives.



Author(s):

Alison ZimbalistThe New York Times Learning Network

Javaid KhanThe Bank Street College of Education in New York City

Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes

Objectives:

Students will:

1. React to patriotic symbols; evaluate ways in which Americans have demonstrated their feelings of patriotism since the September 112001 terrorist attacks; explore patriotism as a common reaction to national crisis.

2. Examine how patriotism can unite and divide a country in times of crisis by reading and discussing “Flag Fever: the Paradox of Patriotism.”

3. Develop questions and strategies for interviewing people of their parents’grandparents’or great-grandparents’ generationsfocusing on times of national crisis or tragedy through which they lived.

4. Conduct interviews; compile interview information in a creative way.

Resources / Materials:

-patriotic items representing your country to display in the classroom (flagsadvertisementsquotationsetc.)

-recording of patriotic tunes of your country and playing device

-classroom board

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-paper

-copies of “Flag Fever: the Paradox of Patriotism” (one per student)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Prior to classdisplay one or several patriotic items representing your country on the classroom board or around the roomand arrange for patriotic music of your country to be playing as students enter the classroom. Students respond in their journals to the following questions (written on the board prior to class): “What does ‘patriotism’ mean to you? How do the items in the environment of the classroom make you feel? Why do these types of symbols evoke these feelings? Think about ways in which Americans have demonstrated their feelings of patriotism since the September 112001 terrorist attacks. What other patriotic symbols and actions can you listeither that are typical representations of patriotism or ones that are specific to the reactions to the terrorist attacks?” After five minutesencourage students to share their answers. (You might want to share Merriam-Webster’s definition of patriotism: “love or devotion to one’s country.”) Thenfurther the discussion by posing these questions: Why is increased patriotism often a reaction to national crisis? Is there is ever a negative side to such nation-wide patriotism for some peopleand if sowhen and to whom?

2. As a classread and discuss “Flag Fever: the Paradox of Patriotism,” focusing on the following questions:

a. Whyuntil September 112001had “generations of Americans never found a compelling reason to take a stiff drink of patriotism or take comfort in its unifying high”? To what generations does this refer?

b. How does this article seem to define “patriotism”?

c. How have geographical and political boundaries somewhat disappeared since the terrorist attacks and the resulting sense of patriotismaccording to this article?

d. What are “Constitutional rights,” and how do they “supposedly form the core of patriotism’s appeal”? What has happened to those rights because of the fear that Americans now feelaccording to this articleand whom in the United States has this impacted?

e. What “self-appointed censors” seem to have emerged in the wake of the September 112001 terrorist attacksand why?

f. Whenaccording to this articlewas the last time that “a heartfelt and reinvigorating love of country [was] universally experienced in the United States”? When else in American history has such patriotism existed?

g. Howaccording to Gary Gerstleis the patriotism that is emerging now different than that which surfaced after the Civil Rights movement and the war in Vietnam?

h. Why does “patriotism seems particularly potent and purely felt among the tens of millions of Americans who came of age after the 1960’s and early 70’s”?

i. Howaccording to historianscan patriotism be unifying and excludingand why does “the (American) flagas much as any symbolembody the paradox”?

j. How have Arab-Americans and members of other ethnic-American groups been affected by the show of patriotism?

k. Why have some Americans reacted negatively to the show of patriotism?

l. What is the history of what the flag should symbolizeaccording to this article?

m. What events in American history stemmed from “a corollary of fearwith abuses most widespread when the federal government (played) a supporting role”?

n. What has the Bush administration done to attempt to combat “systemic abuses of civil liberties” that may arise in the country following the terrorist attacks?

o. What does “scapegoat” mean? Why do you think the article ends with the statement“If the president is going to continue to insist on an inclusive kind of patriotismhome-front defense of tolerance could prove as formidable as the war itself”?

3. Explain to students that they will each be interviewing a person from their parents’grandparents’or great-grandparents’ generationfocusing on a time of national crisis or tragedy through which he or she lived (either in the United States or elsewhere). Firstas a classdetermine what time periods are included in these generations based on the age of their potential intervieweesas well as what events might be included (such as warsassassinations of a leadereconomic depressions and environmental disaster). Nextbrainstorm a list on the board of questions that all students should pose to their interviewees regardless of the events they discuss. For examplestudents might ask about the role that the interviewee played in this troubled time (active participant in some way or bystander)what he or she remembers about the “facts” of the event itself (whowhatwherewhenwhy and how)how patriotism manifested itselfand any negative impacts that resulted for some groups of people. Once a standard set of questions is developedbe sure that all students write them down for use in their interviews. Also explain to students that once they choose an intervieweethey should also each develop questions particular to the topic being discussedwhich may involve some prior research.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Students prepare for and conduct their interviews. Students should write downas accurately as possibletheir questions and the answers they receive. If they wish to use tape recording devicesthey should obtain permission from the interviewees as the first recorded item on the tape. Theneach student should compile his or her interview information in a creative way — a classroom postera narrative or comparison/contrast essaya children’s booka poema brief dramatic piecea piece of visual arta newspaper front pageetc. Students should be encouraged to clarify factual information with other resourcesif necessary. Allow students to share their works with the class orif possiblewith other classes as a museum exhibit entitled “Patriotism in Times of National Crisis: First-Person Perspectives.”

Further Questions for Discussion:

–What is a “symbol,” and what power does a symbol hold?

–What roles do flags play in organizationsboth governmental and non-governmental?

–What symbols represent the United States to youand why?

–What events or people in American history best represent the notion of patriotismand why?

–What is “nationalism”? How is it similar to and different from patriotism?

–How do you define “American”? How has the “picture” of what an American is changed since the United States gained its independence? How did it change in the 20th century? How has it changed in your lifetime?

–What are “civil liberties”? What civil liberties are granted to all Americans? How are those rights protected?

Extension Activities:

1. The writer of the article states“for all its ennobling kickhistorians agree that patriotism has almost always been at odds with itself. It reinforces a sense of community by erecting strong walls to comfort those on the inside. But outside those exclusive wallsit has a history of denying equal protection under the law and making life seem scary.” Support this statement with specific examples from the 20th century or throughout American history. Thencreate an illustrated timelineshort bookor other informational resource based on your findings. You might want to refer to first-person accounts of those who have been “(denied) equal protection under the law and (for whom) life (has been made to) seem scary,” or reread the last paragraph of the article and include the concept of the “scapegoat.” Additionallyyou might explore reports of hate crimes following the terrorist attacks on the United States [listed on sites such as the New York City IndyMedia Center (//nyc.indymedia.org/front.php3?article_id=11365)] and provide your commentary on the reports and on tolerance.

2. The article asserts that “a contentious and still unresolved struggle over what the flag should symbolize has been going on since at least 1863.” Research this history and create an illustrated timeline or encyclopedia entry about it.

3. What does it mean to be an American? Create a collage addressing your response to this question. Alternatelycreate a collage or other creative piece addressing the difference between assimilation and acculturation. You might also develop a guide to the cultures of the community in which you liveincluding important organizations that meet the needs of the various ethnicracialand religious groups that live there.

4. Write a biography for a person who you feel best represents patriotism in the United Statesor write an essaypoemshort storyor short play about the theme of patriotism throughout American history.

5. Brainstorm as many emblems of American patriotism and history as you cancategorizing them under the headings of SymbolsIconsMonumentsand Historic Places. Thenchoose one of these items as the focus of research. What is the history behind this emblem? (Why it was “created,” who created itand when it was created.) Where would one find this item? How has the meaning of this item changed over time? (What does this symbol represent or mean now?) What do you think caused these changes? Thencreate an interesting and colorful classroom poster that traces the “evolution” of this historic American emblem and that includes all research responses. Alternatelyinvestigate symbols of American patriotism and history in your community. Create a tour guide of your community that includes snapshots of historic places and thingsthe history behind the creation of your communityand stories about your community gathered through interviews of long-time residents.

6. Write a historical narrative about an event or era in American history from the perspective of a person (famous or non-famous) living through the events at this time. Include the “creation” or evolution of patriotic symbols in the narrative.

7. Investigate the origins and meaning behind your state’s or country’s flag. Create a creative guide or other presentation of your findings.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Fine Arts – Learn about patriotic musical compositions such as the “Star-Spangled Banner,” “God Bless America,” “You’re a Grand Old Flag,” “Stars and Stripes Forever,” and “America the Beautiful.” In what ways is each piece related to the idea of independence? What was happening in the United States when each piece was written? What ideals does each piece present?

Global History – Write an essay exploring what patriotism and freedom mean in other countries around the worldincluding countries in which citizens have limited freedomscountries that have become democracies in the past fifty yearsand countries that were once under the colonial rule of another country. Alternatelyobtain translations of the national anthems of countries around the worldand compare and contrast their messages. Include your nation’s anthem in the analysis as well.

Journalism – Create a photo journal showing displays of patriotism since the September 112001 terrorist attacks on the United States. Try to include a wide variety of places and methods of demonstrating patriotism in your collection.

Mathematics – The article states that“New York Citythe erstwhile epicenter of selfishness and sinhas been judged in its time of trial and found good by more than 8 out of 10 Americans. Perhaps boundaries were melting between the Red Zonethe conservative heartland that voted for the Republican presidentand the Blue Zonewhere coastal liberals had clung to doubts about President Bush’s work ethichis judgment and his intelligence.” Conduct a school or community poll about changes in views of New York Citydivisions between political partiesthe Bush administration’s and other countries’ reactionsand other topics since the September 112001 attacks. Analyze your results and write an article for your school or local newspaper on your findings. Try to find other polls on similar topics to include as well.

Media Studies – Watch and analyze a movie about a war in which the United States was involved. From whose perspective is the narrative presented? What historic events are offeredand how is their portrayal impacted by the point of view from which the story is told? When was this movie producedand how do you think that impacts the way in which this story was told? How are the people and views of the different sides of the war portrayed? How is the theme of patriotism explored? Write a review of the movie. If possiblefind published reviews and compare your responses.

''I know George was going to give him an opportunity to work,'' Torre said. ''But unfortunatelyI don't know what this does to that.''

 2419,  2005, a, From all appearancesOr seems to have long ago assumed the role of the responsible one in the family: she collects bottles and cans for moneyworks as a dishwasher in a restaurant owned by a sympathetic neighbor and keeps up the family's crampedcluttered apartment as best she can. In turnRuthierecently returned from a hospital staybehaves like one of those out-of-control adolescents who show up on cable television: she dresses like Slattern Barbierefuses to get up in the morningsneaks out at nightkeeps bad company and whinesa lot.

Shot in an unadorned style that makes everything look fairly grottythe women includedthe film mixes scenes of quotidian life with melodramatic incidentand then the whole thing grinds to a stop. Along the wayMs. Yedaya and her co-writerSari Ezouzbuild the case that prostitutes are purely victims and that prostitution is so pathologicalso radically dehumanizingthat the prostitute herself is little more than an empty shell.

In this formulationprostitution isn't a lousy way to make a living; it's an iron cage with a rusted lock. Ruthie and Or are victims not only of povertymale opportunism and social indifferencebut also of their actions and desireswhich don't really belong to them in any meaningful sense becausewelleverything they do and feel is symptomatic of their pathological existence.

Ms. Yedaya's take on prostitution would be tolerable if her charactersespecially Ruthieweren't such ideological constructs. A monster from her gaudy blue eye-shadow to her Frankenstein platformsRuthie insists on breaking her daughter's heart by turning tricks. She says they need the moneybut something else clearly drives her into the streets. But because Ms. Yedaya refuses to give Ruthie a hint of a dreamscapea moment outside that iron cagewe never learn what makes her tick.

That Ruthie might get something she needs from prostitutionhowever unhealthyis something the film refuses to consider; worsethere's a suggestion that Or's teenage lust is a symptom of Ruthie's pathology rather than something good and real and human. Prostitution isn't the only disease in this film; so is desire.

The Dutch photographer Ed van der Elskenwho died in 1990specialized in gritty pictures of the underworld of the NetherlandsParisTokyo and elsewhere. This showthe first presentation of his work in the United States since 1955includes a selection of pictures from throughout his career.

The photographs blend aspects of Robert Frank's melancholy romanticism with Weegee's harsh fascination with the underside of city life. Van der Elsken could find appropriately dark subjects no matter where he went: in Amsterdamhe recorded crowds of young men outside a strip joint; in OsakaJapanhe photographed gangsters in suits and fedoraslined up like the Blues Brothers.

A sweetness underlies the tawdry surface of many of these scenes. In one picture from the Netherlandsteen-agers in black leather jackets and short skirts pause uncertainly during a dance; in a 1953 shot from Parisa young woman kisses her image in a mirror.

Re ''Consulting: Don't Lose ItImprove It'' (ViewpointJan. 4)by Thomas J. Waite:

As a management consultant with more than 30 years' experienceI agree with many of Mr. Waite's points about how to find effective consultants instead of the fee seekersand wish to add a couple of my own.

* Avoid consultants whose primary -- and sometimes only -- approach to helping a troubled enterprise is a rush to technology. A consulting team often does not have any real understanding of the client's business -- including its organizationpersonnelprocessesmanagement strengthsproductscompetition and markets. And it frequently is not interested in or incapable of developing the required understanding of the processes to which the new technology will apply. Indeedthe consulting budget often does not even provide time for this crucial task.

* Choose a consultant who is willing to ask unpopular and unsettling questionsand to recommend actions that challenge the principles and assumptions on which the business is and has been operated. Bringing the client bad news is part of many projects. It takes courage and integrity on the part of the consultantand requires sensitivity as well as good communication skillsdeveloped only from experience.

 2205,  2006, a, The battle with city officials also illustrates the potential political fallout that states' schools chiefs risk as they use the more muscular options of the law for schools that fail to improve over many years.

The moratorium on taking controlan amendment to a schools construction billwould bar the state from initiating any actions toward a takeover until June 2007. The votes in the heavily Democratic legislature were largely along party lineswith Democrats winning large enough margins in the two houses to override an expected veto from Mr. Ehrlich.

In a statementhe accused lawmakers of "fighting for the status quo at the expense of Baltimore city schoolchildren."

Mayor O'Malley portrayed the Baltimore schools as improving.

"The fact of the matter is that after 30 years of decline we're making faster progress than any other jurisdiction in the state," he said. "This is not the time to pull the rug out from reform efforts that are starting to work."

He called the takeover "a blatant political move."

Dr. Grasmickwho spent Friday defending her actions to lawmakerssaid she was not completely surprised by the response. Friday was the last day that the Legislature could act to block the takeover and still have time to override a veto.

The bill reached the governor's desk just minutes before the 5 p.m. deadline.

"I think it's unconscionable," said Dr. Grasmickwho has been superintendent since 1992under three governors. She denied any political motivation.

"There comes a time when you have to think about what is the right thing to do," she said.

If lawmakers indeed override an expected vetoshe predicted "business as usual for another year."

She said that other state superintendents who considered using the No Child Left Behind law to wrest control of chronically failing schools should anticipate the same firestorm that she faced.

Officials of the federal Education Department appeared to lend Dr. Grasmick moral supportbut could offer little else. Although the federal law gives states the authority to take over schoolsit does not address extraordinary measures like legislative intervention carried out on Friday.

39 Greene StreetSoHo

Through June 16

Jeffrey Vallance's second New York solo show is disappointing. The hilarious drawings and collages he showed here in 1999 revealed this veteran California subversive to be an expert and zany cartoonista funny and engaging writer and a perversely assiduous student of popular religions. This exhibition restricts the free play of his goofy enthusiasms.

The main event is a trio of life-size wax figures made by a professional fabricatorVictor Hugo. One is a satin-robed figure of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Another represents President Richard M. Nixonwhose image Mr. Vallance claims to have found miraculously reflected in the eyes of a Mexico City Virgin of Guadalupe. Mr. Vallance has also detected images of evil clowns in the markings on the Shroud of Turin; a collage in the show documents his being rebuked by the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights for publishing this discoverythe artist's respectful explanation of his motives and the league's retraction of its rebuke.

The third wax figure represents the poet Dante. A gallery release says he was included ''because of the immense influence the 'Inferno' has had on Vallance's life and work.'' Right.

All of this is amusing to think aboutbut it lacks the idiosyncratic energy of a drawing titled ''The Devil Hates Good Art,'' in which a portrait of Satan is surrounded by terms indicating artistic qualities he objects toincluding talent and masteryeccentricitysincerity and uniqueness. Mr. Vallance is most engagingafter allwhen he articulates his crazily convoluted ideas in quantity and by means of his own hand. KEN JOHNSON

 3305,  2000, a, To the Editor:

What Paul Krugman says is true: the Social Security system is a pay-as-you-go system and therefore will never offer workers returns as good as they could get outside the system (columnMay 31). And George W. Bush's proposal is short on many salient details.

But what Mr. Krugman misses is that the current system is fundamentally (and fatally) flawed in that citizens own nothing. Mr. Bush's plan is a politically palatable first step toward citizens' actually owning something and therefore controlling their own destiniesrather than an all-powerful government's controlling everything. It truly represents a shifting of power to the people.

Congress is going to fix that.

Congress is going to amend the Constitution to stop it. That's right: the Constitution Itself. The Big Parchment. Going to amend it.

So perhaps inevitablysites and services have popped up that add another level to the information food chain by digesting the Web digests.

The latest such siteKinjais scheduled to open to the public today at www.kinja.com. The site automatically compiles digests of blogs covering subject areas like politics and baseball. Short excerpts from the blogs are includedwith links to the complete entries on the individual blog sites. After signing up for a free account with Kinjausers can enter the addresses of their favorite blogs and generate a digest -- a customized blog of blogs.

The site is designed for people who may have heard about Web logs but are not sure how to start reading themsaid Nick DentonKinja's presidentwhose small blog-publishing empire includes the New York gossip site Gawker (gawker.com).

''Everyone has this illusion that Web logs have taken the world by storm,'' Mr. Denton said''but Web logs have probably only reached 10 percent of the Internet population. Our goal is to reach the remainder.''

SATURDAY’S PUZZLE — We get only one themeless crossword this weekand it’s a fun one by Barry C. Silk. I found it easier than average for this constructor but with plenty of terrific answers.

My favorite clue is “Organization nickname that plays off the group’s secrecy.” Just look into this flashy thingy while I explain that the N.S.A. you thought you had heard of doesn’t even exit. The initials stand for NO SUCH AGENCY. Now go about your business. Experienced solvers know that when “organization” or “agency” is used in a cluethe answer usually goes the other direction to avoid repeating the word.

“Sense” is a good clue for GET A READ ONalthough I had BEAD instead for a while. READ is better. Pledging one’s TROTH is usually done these days while wearing either a tuxedo or an elaborate white dress. It means “Loyalty.” “Awacs,” or as most of the world not constrained by the New York Times style guide calls itAWACSrefers to the Airborne Warning and Control System.

“Producer of hits” for GOOGLE SEARCH seems like an odd clue. Page hits are a common metric for Web sitesbut the hits are “produced” by Google only indirectly. Users click through on pages of search results. In a different sensehoweverit’s literally true. The ranking Google gives your company for a specific search term can mean the difference between being a hit site and corporate death. The details of how Google decides search-results ranking are closely guarded trade secrets. Full disclosure: I also work for the company that created and operates Binga competing search service.

If you had trouble todayI’m going to guess it was near the bottom. “Worn” is THREADBARE and the “Senate cry” is HAIL CAESAR. Yesthat senate. The hefty South-American rodent is a CAPYBARA. Females are even larger than malesweighing in at up to 145 pounds. It reminded me of the untold Sherlock Holmes tale of The Giant Rat of Sumatrawhich Dr. Watson warned us was “a story for which the world is not yet prepared.” If that isn’t scary enougha “chimera” in Greek mythology was a creature assembled from various parts of a snakea lion and a GOAT.

 3040,  2002, a, But such symmetry seems to be lacking in Djiboutia small nation of 600,000 to 700,000. Djibouti is close to Yemena Qaeda haven. It is just north of Somaliawhere groups sympathetic to Al Qaeda have been reportedand not far from Kenyawhere terrorists carried out a suicide bombing at a hotel frequented by Israeli tourists last weekwhile trying simultaneously to shoot down an Israeli airliner. Djibouti also sits astride vital sea lanes that are being used to ship American matériel to the Persian Gulf.

So it is not surprising that the Pentagon would want to deploy some 800 Special Operations forces and other troops here to strike at terrorist cells in Yemen and East Africa. It is also clear why the C.I.A. has set up shop here. The C.I.A. recently used Djibouti to mount an attack on a Qaeda operative in Yemen with a Predator drone equipped with Hellfire missiles.

What may seem surprising is that Washington allocated a mere $8.7 million in assistance for 2002 for its new ally in the war on terror. Much of the assistance is intended to upgrade the airportnow a hub for military operations. Only a small fraction is intended to meet the nation's pressing humanitarian and development needs. Djiboutiin factis such a low priority for assistance that the Agency for International Developmentthe foreign aid arm of the American governmentclosed its office here in the mid-1990's.

Djibouti is hardly the only case in which Washington has taken what critics say is a narrow view of how to pursue its antiterrorism campaign. In Afghanistanfor examplethe United States used its warplanes and teams of Special Operations forces to topple the Taliban. But once the Taliban were driven from powerWashington did not expand and deploy the international peacekeepers in cities throughout the countrybut kept them close to Kabul.

In the case of Djiboutithe country is so small that advocates of a greater civilian aid effort say Washington might accomplish much here with very little. ''It is a small country with huge problems,'' said Jorge Mejiathe head of the Unicef office in Djibouti.

 4989,  1990, a, Three Million Mailings

Roger Cravera direct-mail consultant with half a dozen clients who have questioned the Souter nominationsaid he had already sent out three million mailings to alert people about a possible fight over abortion. He said he was preparing a second series of mailings aimed at the Judiciary Committee and the Senate ''to impress upon the Senate that they must ask this question'' about the judge's stand on abortion.

One letter sent by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund sought an ''emergency contribution,'' with this statement: ''You can count on my help in launching the Fund for Justice to make certain that Judge Souter will be the kind of Supreme Court Justice who recognizes and protects our right to privacy and reproductive rights.''

Anotheran ''express wire'' from the National Organization for Womendeclared: ''Judge Souter must be subjected to the same level of scrutiny to which Robert Bork was subjected in 1987. We expect no less this time from the Senate Judiciary Committee.''

'Collecting Data' on Souter

Groups that oppose abortion have not been as quick to produce mailingseven though organizations on both sides of the issue found that the longer the debate simmered the more money they collected when Judge Robert H. Bork's nomination was before the Senate in 1987.

The direct-mail company of Richard A. Delgaudiowhich produced solicitations in the Bork battlehas not yet used Judge Souter for fund raising. ''Organizations don't know as much about Souter,'' said George Lodicka company official. ''They're in the process of collecting data. So we haven't decided anything.''

Even though the rape allegation recalls an incident two years ago in which several football players at the academy were accused of groping female cadets during an athletic rallymale and female cadets here said that they experienced few if any difficulties with each other.

One male cadet said that he had taken his three-mile jog that morning with a female cadet whom he counted as one of his best friends. Another male cadet noted that while there were only 525 female cadets to the 3,468 male cadetstwo of the six cadets on the senior brigade staff were female.

As students walked from one building to another between classes todayyoung men and young women strode in tandem. In factin their hatscrisply pressed uniforms and monotonously formal voicesthey were sometimes practically indistinguishable.

''From the time I got hereI couldn't believe how well everyone gets along,'' said Eric Tisland21a second-year cadet from BlackduckMinn. ''I assumed there would be more of a conflictbut there isn't.''

More than a dozen cadets interviewed here today said that the academy devoted significant time and resources to teaching male and female cadets to behave responsibly toward each other. They said that when cadets first arrivedthey attended seminars and discussions about sexual harassment and date rape. Not only are women encouraged to report men who act or talk inappropriatelycadets saidbut men are also instructed to lodge complaints about women who do so.

Lindy Williams18a first-year cadet from TampaFla.said she actually felt protected and secure among her male classmates here. She said that on Wednesday morningfor examplewhen a genuine-sounding scream was broadcast over her dormitory intercom as a sort of Halloween trickthree male cadets were at her door within 10 seconds to make sure that she and her roommates were all right. ''One of the principal rules of conduct they teach us is consideration of others,'' Cadet Williams said.

 2118,  2007, a, Updated1:04 p.m. | The city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene is investigating whether a Staten Island girl got sick from eating hamburger meat tainted with E. coli. On Saturdaythe Topps Meat Company of ElizabethN.J.issued a nationwide recall for 21.7 million pounds of ground beef products after reports of up to 25 cases of illness caused by suspected E. coli bacteria in eight statesincluding New YorkNew Jersey and Connecticut.

Of the 25 confirmed cases nationwideseven have been in New York State. The illness of the Staten Island girl has not been definitively linked to the meat. The girl has been diagnosed with E. coli infection. Her mother has reported intestinal illnessbut the city has not yet released a diagnosis.

This morningThe Staten Island Advance identified the girl as Brianna DiMartini12of the Great Kills neighborhood. The Advanceciting interviews with the girl’s parentsreported that she has been in the pediatric intensive care unit of Staten Island University HospitalOcean Breezeand that she had a hamburger made from Topps chopped meat. The Advance also reported that her motherAllison DiMartinihas had severe intestinal distress.

The voluntary recall — an expanded version of a recall issued last Tuesday for nearly 332,000 pounds of Topps beef — was the first in the 67-year history of Toppsone of the nation’s largest meat processing concerns.

E. coli O157:H7 is a food-borne bacterium that can cause bloody diarrheadehydration and kidney damage. It usually clears up within a week in adultsbut can be deadly in infantsolder people and those with compromised immune systems.

The official recall notice [pdf] covers a wide range of frozen hamburger patties and other products manufactured over the last year and bearing a “sell by” date between last Tuesday and Sept. 252008along with the United States Department of Agriculture designation EST 9748.

As a precautionthe city’s Health Department is urging New Yorkers to throw away any Topps ground beef hamburgers. The department urged anyone who has consumed Topps hamburgers and develops symptoms such as severe diarrhea and abdominal crampsor blood in the stoolto visit a hospital or clinic immediately.

The city said in a statement: “As a reminderNew Yorkers can help prevent E. coli by cooking meat thoroughly (at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit for ground beef)keeping raw meats and their juices away from other foods when cookingand washing hands regularly.”

Senator Charles E. SchumerDemocrat of New Yorksaid in a statement: “Regulation has totally broken down and the industry is running the show. The sad fact of the matter is that food safety regulation has actually gotten weaker over the last five years and until it gets strongerunfortunately there will be more dangerous outbreaks. We need more inspectors and have to stop letting the industry have too great a say over what the regulators do.”

 1229,  2012, a, As my colleague Kirk Johnson reportsthe Seattle Police Department has turned to Twitter to post police blotter items online for residents looking to keep up with police-related activity in their neighborhood.

The department divvied up the mostly automated 51 Twitter feeds by police sectors and beats to deliver incident reports at a local level.

As an exampleresidents in a sector called J2 in Seattle’s North Precinctlearned over the weekend about an auto theft in their neighborhood and a “disturbance.”

Beat:J2AUTO THEFT at NW VERNON PL / SHILSHOLE AV NW reported on 10/1/2012 2:23 AM — SeattlePD John2 (@SeattlePDJ2) 1 Oct 12

Beat:J2DISTURBANCEOTHER at 9XX BLOCK OF NW LEARY WAY reported on 10/1/2012 12:48 PM — SeattlePD John2 (@SeattlePDJ2) 1 Oct 12

But updates are not delivered in real time so residents won’t necessarily know right away why there is a police cruiser with flashing lights on their block.

To protect crime victims and “the integrity of crime scenes,” the department noted in its announcement that the information on the Twitter feeds appears about one hour after a police officer gets the call from a dispatcher. The feeds also do not include information about sexual assaults or incidents involving domestic violence.

More newsworthy incidents are reported on the department’s main Twitteraccount@SeattlePD and might even generate a blog postas this report did about two men engaged in a fight apparently over drugs and a womanusing a curtain rod and a can of soup as their weapons of choice.

Sohow are the reports being received? A look at the conversation on Twitter suggests — and this is probably a good thing for the city’s law enforcement leaders — they are not generating tremendous excitement as most of the reports are of minor incidents. Of courseit depends on what feed you are following.

@jaydeflix @seattlepd I only follow D2 and L3 and they’re nowhere near as exciting. — kristen206 (@kristen206) 28 Sep 12

The goal of the program is to push out information or provide a new version of the old police scanner.

Butas customer service and social media marketing directors at major brands have learned in recent yearsit is vital that institutions listen as well as push distribute information. That remains a big challenge for the Seattle Police since beat accounts are automated and the main account is managed by the department’s public affairs department.

@jeffwilcox @SeattlePD I am surprised that more police dept are not taking real-time complaints via Twitter or is Seattle PD listening? — Dmitry Lyalin (@LyalinDotCom) 30 Sep 12

Over the weekendJeff Wilcoxa Twitter user who lives in Seattle and is a software developer at Microsoftposted on Twitter information about speeding motorcycles that the police department might want to know about. He copied @seattlepd.

A group of 4 motorcycles speeding and doing wheelies at Eastlake and Lynnvideotaping their stunts /cc @seattlepd — Jeff Wilcox (@jeffwilcox) 30 Sep 12

Last weekMr. Shuger was the target of some pretty fiery critiques himself.

The reason was his comments in last Monday's column about African-American college students. He was critiquing an article in The New York Times about a survey that showed a wide disparity in computer use between students entering elite private colleges and those attending traditionally black public institutions.

Mr. Shuger suggested that ''it might be good to add a question to the survey: 'Do you have a luxury sound system or a car less than two years oldor a luxury sound system in that car?' Today's Papers recalls being in Atlanta a few years ago at the annual spring break for traditionally black collegesFreaknikand being amazed at the numbers of students' hot cars and loud stereos. Any computer/Internet paucity among students attending traditionally black colleges may be a function of their own interests and choices rather than that of affordability.''

E-mail responses to the magazine were overwhelmingly negativecalling Mr. Shuger's remarks ''racist'' and ''idiotic.''

 4540,  1993, a, But the college has been embroiled in frequent disputes. It was one of three institutions censured this year by the American Association of University Professorswhich accused the college of ousting faculty members without cause or due process and cited the dismissal of teachers who had supported a movement to establish a student government.

"It appeared to us this was not an institution that met minimal standards for accreditation," said Lesley Lee Francisassociate secretary of the professors' association.

The college said the associationwhich is not an accrediting bodyhas no jurisdiction over the institution. The regional accrediting bodythe Southern Association of Colleges and Schoolsinvestigated accusations against the college but left its accreditation intact.

During the investigationthe college sued the associationone of many legal actions the institution is involved in. The college itself is being sued by four students who accuse it of attracting them with inflated claims about resources and programs and then defaming them by linking them to a pipe-bomb explosion on campus last year. The college denies the contentions and is countersuing.

The college has also filed suit against the School of Visual Artsa New York-based institution that is starting a Savannah campus; its presidentDavid Rhodesand eight former Savannah College of Art and Design teachersadministrators and trusteesaccusing them of conspiring to destroy the college's business and reputation.

All have denied the charges and several are countersuingaccusing the college of using malicious litigation to silence critics and help it win approval of the bond issue. In his lawsuit and his statement to the authorityMr. Minskywhose group is representing the four students and a former teacheraccuses the college of misrepresenting its curriculumemployment conditionsequipmentbuildings and financial practices and of lying on its bond application.

Seth Davisa writer for Sports Illustrated and college basketball analyst for CBSis the author of “When March Went Mad: The Game That Transformed Basketball.” It’s a look at the 1979 N.C.A.A. title game that featured Magic Johnson’s Michigan State team against Larry Bird’s Indiana State squad. In an e-mail interviewDavis discussed both playersthe impact the game had on the sport and whether we will ever see anything like it again.

Magic vs. Bird is one of the most famous individual rivalries in sports history. When you started this bookwere you worried that almost too much was known about them?

Not reallybecause I knew I was reporting on a time in their lives that was not well-known to the public. There was certainly much about them that I didn’t know before embarking on this project. For exampleI had no idea just how close Larry Bird came to never playing college basketball. If Bill Hodgeswho had just gotten hired as an assistant at Indiana State in the spring of 1975hadn’t managed to gently coax Bird off a garbage truck and convince him to give college one more trywe would have never heard of Larry Bird. LikewiseI learned a lot about Magic’s childhoodspecifically the fact that when he was a teenager he was bused to a mostly-white school with no basketball tradition. And of coursethe story of that season had many fascinating twists and turns that I never knew about. Most of the people who watched the 1979 championship game were seeing these guys play for the first timeso the details about what brought them to that historic first meeting are not well-known even to most of their biggest fans.



You weren’t able to talk to Johnson or Bird. Are there questions that you would have liked to ask Johnson or Bird that you didn’t get a chance to?

I would like to have had the chance to try to get them to go beyond the sugar-coatedanodyne versions of what went on back then that they usually try to tell. It’s not that I would have trolled for controversybut as a reporter you’re always trying to get closer to the truth. But those guys have been such open books – literally sosince they both wrote autobiographies and have had numerous books written about themnot to mention the hundreds of interviews they have given – that it’s unlikely they would have told me something fundamentally new. If anythingnot talking to them liberated me so I could view them with a more of a reporter’s critical eye. Maybe if I had spent a lot of time of them I would have subconsciously tried to please them as I wrote.

The championship game itself was a little underwhelming. Bird had one of his worst games of the season and Michigan State was in control from the outset. Stillthe audience for it was enormous. What was it about this game that drew so many people to it? Was it simply the personalities of the two stars? Would it be remembered so fondly if Magic and Bird didn’t become Magic and Bird?

It wasto coin a phrasea perfect storm. First and foremostpeople really understood that these guys were uniqueand uniquely talentedplayers. They were big menand they were making it cool to pass. Then you had the whole David-versus-Goliath thing. Indiana State was this little-known school from the Missouri Valley Conference with the mysterious farm boyand yet somehow they made it all the way to the final game undefeated. Were they really that good? In a one-and-done scenariothat was extremely alluring. The fact that Bird was white and Magic was black added to the sexiness of the matchupbut the biggest reason there was such a huge audience was simply because there weren’t that many viewing options back then. Instead of 800 channelsthere were only 4. As for them becoming Magic and Birdthat obviously would not have affected the 24.1 Nielsen rating they generated that nightbut because of what they went on to accomplishthis is one of the rare instances when an event that was huge at the time it happened has only grown in significance as recedes further in the rearview mirror.

Can you talk a little bit about the news media coverage of the two players? While both received more than their share of praise (including each being featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated) they were also the focus of heavy criticism at times. For exampleDavid Israel of The Chicago Tribune excoriated Bird for not talking to the pressand Bill Gleason of The Chicago Sun-Times called Johnson “a mediocre passer and ball handler.”

Wellit’s all relativeof course. The media coverage back then was only a fraction of what it would be today. But it’s amazing to think that Larry Birdwho in many ways was the biggest story in college basketball that seasonwent basically the entire year without talking to the press. Can you imagine a high-profile athlete pulling that off today – or even wanting to?

They both had their share of skeptics as to how well their skills would translate into the N.B.A.especially since they weren’t naturally gifted athletes. The main difference is that while Bird couldn’t stand dealing with the mediaMagic absolutely relished in ityet he did it in a way that somehow never alienated his teammates. With themhe was just a down-to-earth guy who treated everybody well. It speaks volumes about his personality and character that he was able to be a larger than life media icon (especially in Lansing)yet his teammates loved him. Maybe it has something to do with the number of easy buckets he got them!

Phil Martelli can take some solace in the fact that Billy Packer was not too impressed the first time he came across Bird and Indiana State. What sort of insight did Packer give you into the seasonespecially as someone who sort of became a lighting rod for Sycamores fans?

Yesthe more things changethe more they stay the same! One thing people don’t realize about Billy Packer is that not only is he willing to admit when he’s wronghe actually enjoys being proven wrong. I will say that Billy never did quite get out of his mind-set that the only high-quality basketball is being played in major conferences. But a lot of people doubted whether Indiana State was for real that season. I reallyreally enjoyed talking to Billy about everything that happenedjust like I always enjoy talking to him about college basketball history. He has a great memoryterrific insights and he always tells you what he thinks no matter the consequences.

This book deals with more than just Magic Johnson vs. Larry Birdof course. Indiana State Coach Bill Hodges emerges as one of the more interesting charactersnot least because of what happened with his coaching career after that title game. How much did you know about Hodges when you started and what’s your perspective on him now?

How much did I know? I didn’t even know the guy’s name. Seriouslyeven if you asked the most ardent college basketball fans the question of who was Bird’s coach in that gameI’ll bet almost none of them could tell you. And yetas you saidhe turned out to be probably the most interesting character in the book. Bill has really been through a lotboth good and bad. A lot of people in his situation would have emerged with bitterness and regretbut Bill has a great perspective on all that has happened. He is currently a high school history teacher in RoanokeVa.and he genuinely enjoys his jobhis life and spending time with his grandchildren.

I can understand why he was able to convince Larry to get off that garbage truck. I would have played for the guytooif he asked me.

A similar question about Jud Heathcotewho went on to have a successful career at Michigan State after Johnson left. He seems like quite the character.

For literary gristit’s hard to imagine a better subject than Jud. He is smartblunt and absolutely hilarious. It was interesting for me to go back to that time and learn more about what he was likeand what his players thought about him. Today we think of Heathcote as this hilarious old codgerbut the reality ishis players really did not like him. They didhoweverrespect his basketball knowledge. They had a lot to sort through as a unit to make it to that title game. He had to give a littlewhich wasn’t easy for himbut at that stage in his life there was only so much he was going to change. He had a pretty bad health scare last summerbut it seems like he has come through O.K. and he’s as ornery as ever. God bless that man.

The outcome of this game clearly still gnaws at Bird. Without giving too much awaythe closing scene shows him as still broken up about the outcome. Were you surprised by how much the game has stayed with both playersespecially Bird?

That’s something that didn’t surprise mebecause we all know what intense competitors those guys were. The reason it gnaws so much at Bird is because he knows it’s something he can never get back. When Magic won an N.B.A. title or an M.V.P. awardLarry could always say“I’ll get mine next year.” But this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunityand only one of them could prevail.

And even though they’re great friends nowthey’re still competitorsand Magic will always have the last word. I also think Larry’s regret stems largely from his affection for the community of Terre Haute. He knew how much this game meant to themand he still feels like he let them down.

In this day and agewith wall-to-wall sports coverage on television and on the Internetcould we ever have a situation like this again?

Absolutely not. That’s what makes it such a great story to revisit. We still get great games and great individual matchupsbut you have to rememberthis game was literally the first time most people had seen these guys play.

Takefor examplewhat Bryant Gumbel said the night of the game when he hosted the pregame segment for NBC: “If you haven’t seen Larry Bird playyou’re in for a treat.” Think about it – in my current role for CBSwould it have ever occurred to me to say before last year’s championship game“If you haven’t seen Derrick Rose playyou’re in for a treat”? There was an innocence back thena delayed gratification that paid off eventually in spades. I love watching wall-to-wall basketball as much as anyonebut in a way it’s a shame that that element of the unknown is gone now. A little mystery goes a long way.

 2854,  2003, a, In contrast to Syria's previous belligerent statements about the need for an immediate end to the American occupation of IraqhoweverMr. Assad softened his country's position. Asked how he felt about having 100,000 American soldiers as his newest neighborshe sounded almost resigned.

''The problem is not whether you have one American soldier or a million American soldiers on your borders,'' he said. ''And the problem is not whether they are going to stay one year or 10 years. The problem is whether the U.S. is going to become a power for achieving turbulence in the region instead of being an element of stability.''

Mr. Assad acknowledged that it was up to the Iraqis to decide on the opportune moment for the United States to withdrawbut said democracy could not be achieved at gunpoint. ''I think the solution in Iraq is to allow the Iraqis to write their own constitution and to elect their own government,'' he said.

In those remarksthe Syrian president joined the unusual chorus of Arab leaders calling for measures in Iraq that often do not exist in their own countries. Although there is an official political opposition hereit is largely toothless. The Baath Party and various police agencies run the countrywith rigorous controls against dissentand much of the economy is state controlled.

Mr. Assad ruled out the deployment of Syrian troops as part of any peacekeeping force in Iraqsaying that given decades of friction between the countriesa Syrian contingent would probably be unacceptable to the Iraqis.

The American invasion at first seemed to give Syria a case of the jitters. On the day that the United States Army brought the statue of Saddam Hussein crashing down in BaghdadSyrian television broadcast a long documentary about Islamic architecture. On the streets of Damascus at the timeSyrians could be heard whispering jokes about knocking over their own statuesor at least winning greater freedom.

Mr. Assad conceded that some of his fellow citizens might have considered the upheaval in Iraq contagiousbut said any idea of Iraq as a model for change was fading beneath the grim reality of daily violence.

 4795,  1991, a, More than 15 months before the opening of the 25th Summer OlympicsBarcelona has already decided that the stars will be the artistsdesigners and architects who are using the games to promote this city as a major European cultural center.

There is little talk about athletics here these daysbut a $50 million program called the Cultural Olympics is in full swing. Furthera $7 billion urban renewal program preparing the city for the games is as much a tribute to sculpture and architecture as it is to engineering.

The message is clear: Barcelona is determined to be remembered for more than just three weeks of good organization and intense competition after the closing ceremony of the Olympics on Aug. 91992.

"The Olympic Games are an exceptional occasion that enables us to mobilize exceptional resources," said Manuel Forestea spokesman for the Cultural Olympics. "We aspire to turn Barcelona into a cultural capital that forms part of the international circuit of the arts." Rich PastRich Present

 1822,  2008, a, There were political neophytes and students of foreign policyonetime Republicans and lifelong Democrats.

There were bankers and lawyersand probably a few sons of bankers and sons of lawyerstoo. The only thing missing were the Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters.

Welcome to Obama Singles Night in East Midtownwhere a beer was $8 and a mixed drink $12.

Barack Obama probably wasn’t thinking of this crowd at The Grand on East 58th Street — a gathering of several hundred young professionals who are supporting him — when he made a pitch during Thursday night’s debate for health care that would give poor families more options than the emergency room. But they ate it up anyway.

They also went nuts every time CNN zoomed in on one of the many celebrities in the audience like Stevie Wonder or Pierce Brosnan. But mostly they were cheering for Mr. Obama.

If nothing elsethe crowd on Thursday night at The Grandon 58th Street on Manhattan’s East Sidewas diverse — sociallyethnicallypolitically and professionally. And while Mr. Obama was their manthey clearly had wrestled with the decision.

“He was like my favorite college professorand she was like my dominating mother,” said Clair Kennya 24-year-old city employeewho added that it was not an easy choice deciding to support Mr. Obama over Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. “I think as a womanyou don’t see many feminine role models as inspirational as Hillary. And that’s tempting. But Obama is closer to what I believe inand that transcends gender.”

Said Jacob Buchdahl35a lawyerwho was undecided until September: “LookHillary is brilliant and accomplished and highly knowledgeable about the issues. But as far as who inspires you as a leaderI don’t think it’s even close.”

Mr. Buchdahl said he was torn partly because the first vote he cast was for Bill Clinton. But in the endhe saidMr. Obama reminded him more of Mr. Clinton’s spark and enthusiasm than Mrs. Clinton did.

Some were not even sure they were voting for Mr. Obama.

“Barack seems to be kind of trendy right nowso that’s what attracted me,” said Valerie Thertus22a medical student whose intense academic schedule has left her with little time to read up on presidential politics. Thursday was one of here rare nights out.

“It’s Barack-mania right now,” she said“and I just wanted to know more about what’s going on.”

And not everyone could even vote. “I’m Canadian,” responded James Nidd30a bankerwhen asked which candidate he was supporting.

In theoryhe saidhe would vote for Mr. Obama. So why bother to come if you can’t vote? “The outcome of this election,” Mr. Nidd said“affects the entire world.”

 1807,  2008, a, AMESIowa – Call it post-New Year’s fun or pre-caucus jittersbut Hillary Rodham Clinton’s sense of humor – which her friends often recommend when trying to “humanize” her – was clearly on display today.

Perhaps she was trying not to think about the Des Moines Register poll resultsbut Mrs. Clinton was quick with the punch lines this morning. Nearing the end of months of campaigning in Iowashe likened the grueling process to a “consumer’s union.” (Her other lineabout letting people look in her mouth like livestock for salegot fewer laughs.) She trotted out her folksy story about boiling frogs with special panacheand milked the foibles of the Bush-Cheney administration with relish. She even used technical troubles as a source of punch lines. And the crowd of 750 ate it up.



On Dick Cheney’s hunting mishap earlier this year: “The vice president shot somebody,” she saidto guffaws in the audience. “I thought‘I’ll never be surprised or shocked again.’”

On a roar of approval coming from the adjoining roomwhen no one in her room made a sound: “That’s the overflow room. Either thator it’s the end of a great New Year’s Eve partyI’m not sure which.” More chuckles.

On feedback from the speakers: “I was in Muscatine yesterday in the middle of going on about the Bush administrationand the microphone completely died. I said‘I know they’re a little obsessed with mebut this is getting absurd.’”

She killed.

The fire's cause remained unknown. Initial reports described the disaster as an explosion that appeared to have been set off when an employee opened the door to the buildinga mah-jongg parlor in the Shinjuku Wardat about 1 a.m.

Later reports suggested that the incident began with a fire that set off the explosionwhich ripped a large hole in the wall of the establishment. The mah-jongg club was on the third floor of a building that contained restaurants and sex clubsaccording to televised news reports.

The fire took place in a crime-ridden and seedy neighborhood where Chinese gangs are activebut there was no immediate indication the fire had been deliberately set.

 1512,  2010, a, As the search for causes of the financial crisis continues in Washingtonone economistRussell Roberts of George Mason Universitysays he believes that it was inept government policynot Wall Street greedthat allowed the financial system to spin out of control.

Mr. Robertswho follows the free-market Hayek school of economicsargues in a new paper that almost any attempt to reform the nation’s financial regulatory structure will fail to prevent another crisisas the government will continue to limit the downside risk to both Main Street and Wall Streetencouraging reckless behavior.

He contends that the government has put in place a system in which it is easy to gamble with other people’s money — particularly borrowed money — by making sure that almost everybody who makes bad loans gets their money back.

“The financial crisis of 2008 was a natural result of these perverse incentives,” Mr. Roberts argues in his paper“Gambling With Other People’s Money: How Perverted Incentives Caused the Financial Crisis.” He asserts that “we must return to the natural incentives of profit and loss if we want to prevent future crises.”

Mr. Roberts argues that public policy decisions have perverted the incentives that naturally create stability in financial markets and the market for housing by subsidizing losses for bondholders and homeownersrespectively. He believes that over the last 30 years government policy has “coddled creditors,” reducing the risk they face from financing bad investments.

While he says that Wall Street was not blameless in this systemas bankers lobbied for polices that created the problemit was the government’s track record of riding to the rescue of investors that allowed them to take far greater risks than they normally would have if they thought they could lose nearly everything.

For exampleMr. Roberts argues that the government policy to push for greater home ownership led to a chain of events in which unqualified borrowers were getting mortgages for houses they could never afford.

The banks wrote the mortgages to sell to investors who in turn sold them off to government-backed entitiesFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Without such entitieslending standards would have been stronger.

The public jumped on the housing bandwagon as investors. For no money downthanks to changes in government policypeople could buy real estate with little downside risk. If they could not pay their mortgagesthey could always walk away from their homes with little loss.

The same can be said for large investors. From the Mexican peso crisis in 1995 to the collapse of the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management in 1998 and the fall of Bear Stearns in 2008the government stepped up with plans to help large institutional investors from losing money.

While equity holders bear the risk of profit and lossMr. Roberts argues that bondholders have little downside risk thanks to government intervention.

This supposed preference for bondholders helped Freddie and Fannie attract billions of dollars from small and large investorswhich in turnfinanced the housing boom as it allowed these government-sponsored enterprises to buy up all those bad mortgages.

If Fannie’s and Freddie’s bonds reflected their true riskthey would never have been bought up by the Chinese government or small investorsMr. Roberts contendsadding that the government just made things worse when it moved in to secure the two mortgage giants in the fall of 2008.

By not letting the bondholders bear some lossMr. Roberts arguesthe government just made the system riskier.

The one case in which the government did not come to the rescue involved Lehman Brothers. While some people believe that the failure of such an interconnected investment bank was a main reason that the financial crisis acceleratedMr. Roberts sees it differently.

It was the shock of a possible change in government policy to bail out troubled bondholdersnot the collapse of Lehmanthat sent the markets into a tailspin.

When the market thought the government would not bail out other companies from that point onwardinvestors began pulling their money out of the systemMr. Roberts noted.

It was not until the government signaled that it would not let any other major financial firm fail that the markets started to normalize.

So-called moral hazard is therefore deeply rooted in the investing world. As suchMr. Roberts contends that Wall Street is nothing more than a giant government-sanctioned Ponzi scheme.

“Rescues have distorted the natural feedback loops of capitalism,” Mr. Roberts wrote. “Rescuing rich people from the consequences of their decisions with money coming from average Americans is bad for democracy.”

In the endMr. Roberts argues that financial regulatory overhaul will fail to prevent future criseswith investors — homeownersbondholders or Wall Street bankers — continuing to count on the government to bail them out if anything goes wrong.

While some believe more regulation is neededMr. Roberts argues that it was government intervention in the markets that created the crisis and that lessnot moreregulation is what the system needs to heal and to survive.

 5467,  1987, a, The United Stateswhich has portrayed Iran as the main aggressor in the Persian Gulf warhas strongly protested Iraq's renewed attacks on Iranian targetsState Department officials said today.

But Iraq's Ambassador to the United StatesNizar Hamdoonsaid that despite the American protestIraq would continue its attacks on Iranian offshore oil installations and ships carrying Iranian oil in the gulf.

''Iraq never promised anybody we were going to stay idle for a specific time,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''We share the Americans' concernbut we have the right to decide our own policy.'' Iran Attacks Kuwaiti Ship

As Iraq carried out air raids for the third straight day today against Iranian oil targets in the gulfan Iranian speedboat opened fire with machine guns on a Kuwaiti freighter.

 5946,  1982, a, Reports that prominent Argentines have been members of a secret Italian lodge called Propaganda 2 are being investigated here after the recent arrest in Switzerland of the Italian industrialist who headed it.

The industrialistLicio Gelliwho was seized with a fraudulent Argentine passport in mid-Septemberwas said to have disappeared from Italy 18 months ago and to have been in hiding here and in Uruguay under the protection of military leaders. Among the charges filed against him in Italy were swindling and espionage.

President Reynaldo B. Bignone has reportedly met with Argentina's senior military leaders to discuss the ramifications of statements made by Italian investigators that 26 prominent Argentinesamong them generalsformer Cabinet members and leading businessmenhad belonged to the secret lodge.

The Argentine Government recently announced regulations prohibiting television stations and state-owned radio stations from reporting on the affair and other sensitive matters. The regulations did not apply to newspapers or magazines. Journalists Are Threatened

 1837,  2008, a, As a special treat for readers of The Momentthe power gallerist Emmanuel Perrotin writes about new exhibitions in Paris.

Yesterday night was the opening of the “La Louvre – Paris” exhibition by Gelitinthe four-man art collectiveat the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (ARC). The Museum was packed. A fashiony and artsy crowd was hanging out at the entrance and inside the museum.

The group known as Gelitinfrom Viennatook over an entire floor of the museum. They filled the space that the museum gave them with more than 3,000 artworksfrom big installationsto small piecesexhibited from the floor to ceiling. Broken wallstoiletsphotographs of men half nakedpiles of chairspipesstuffed animalsreal birds — this is the world of Gelitin. A whole room is filled with paintings made with modeling clay: a re-visitation of masterpieces referencing Paris: La Joconde (Leonardo da Vinci)etc. See above.

A large band of artistic friends took part in the creation of some works. After being overwhelmed by the vision of all these works (paintingssculpturesinstallationdrawings knitting worksphotos.)I started to detect the smell of caramel and cheesewhich were used to make some of the works on display. Cheeselike caramelwas coated on to a sculpture: the smell was very strong as the room was getting warmer and full of visitors.

The world of Gelitin could be defined as an enormous extravagant chaotic and proliferating universe. It is difficult to describe the work with a few adjectives. I am very enthusiastic with this exhibition and its dynamiccolorfulunpredictable and unique in its style. I was leaving the museum while a band was performing in front of an extravagant and flamboyant crowd.

 4743,  1991, a, Kline May Sign On as Papp Aide

Kevin Kline may soon be added to the list of directors whom Joseph Papp has hired to oversee programming at the Public Theater. Such a movesome staff members feelcould threaten the future of Mr. Papp's newly appointed artistic associate and apparent successorJoAnne Akalaitis. Mr. Papp is having discussions with Mr. Kline to supervise the Shakespeare marathonwhich began in January 1988 and which has so far included 15 of the 36 plays. Two of the more successful efforts have been Mr. Kline's "Hamlet," in which he starred and directedand "The Taming of the Shrew," with Tracey Ullman and Morgan Freemandirected by A. J. Antoon. StillMr. Papp acknowledges he has been "unhappy with some of the work we've done" in the marathon.

Staff members at the Public say he's also been uncertain about the long-term role of Ms. Akalaitiswho has had trouble fitting in with the Shakespeare Festival's entrenched permanent staff. "She is very insecure and difficult to deal withand Joe hates insecurity more than anything," says one staff memberwho spoke on condition of anonymityadding that Ms. Akalaitiswho is directing "Henry IVParts 1 and 2" for a March 6 openingmight not welcome reporting to Mr. Kline.

Mr. Papp says: "Kevin Kline is one of our finest Shakespearean actorsbut he hasn't said yes yet. JoAnne Akalaitis is the best director we haveand she will figure very prominently in the future of this institution." Mr. Papp says a lot also depends on Mr. Kline's film commitments. "We still need to formulate the relationships," he says. "Kevin might just director just act. He might also be on our board of directors. I want to hug him tighter to this institution." Mr. Kline's agentJeff Huntersays"It would be premature to comment."

Mr. Papp says he would like to see Mr. Kline create a small company using the talents of younger people. "I used to say that all you needed to do Shakespeare was two planks and a passion," he said. "I don't feel that way anymore. You need a psychological milieu which JoAnne knows how to create. Her 'Henry IV' is six hours of Shakespeare I really enjoyed. I think she and Kevin would make a wonderful alliance."
 5397,  1987, a, The League of Women Voters of Connecticut would like to comment on statements made in two recent articles on resource recovery:

Peter Villano stated in his article''Resource Recovery: The Facts for Both Sides'' [ OpinionDec. 28 ] : ''Those who tout recycling as an alternative to incineration are only fooling themsleves and the public. It won't work. There is just so much -no more than 20 percent of the total -that you can profitably separate from the waste stream.''

Responsible proponents of recycling do not suggest that all waste can be recycled; simply that the recycling of reusable waste materials can significantly reduce the amount of waste that must be disposed of by incineration or other means. Recycling can and does workand 20 percent is significant.

Until such time as waste-to-engergy facilities are available to all communities in the statea 20 percent reduction in the waste stream can prolong the life of a landfillandas municipal landfills reach capacitycan result in valuable savings in tipping costs at alternate sites.

According to Betsy Percoski's article ''Bonds IssuedState Draws Closer to Trash-to-Energy System'' [ Jan. 11 ] the City of Norwalk may soon pay up to $13,500 a day to dump its trash at a landfill in New Milford. Communities throughout the state can tell similar stories. The sale of the recycled municipal trasheven at current low pricescan help offset the cost of separating and hauling it. When trash is simply dumpedthere is no recovery of the cost of hauling and dumping.

 5385,  1987, a, THURSDAY'S assemblage of music by the New Music Consort at Weill Recital Hall seemed touched by a variety of influencing handsyet all these pieces followed the serious steadfastness of purpose that has marked mainstream 20th-century composition.

Thus postwar jazzfor exampleis very much the substance of Charles Wuorinen's Trio for TrombonePercussion and Pianowhile in Ruth Meyer's ''Fragments of Sappho'' her spare harp writing and the flute part's bendings of pitch gave an almost Japanese accompaniment to these song settings for soprano.

Two of Thursday's pieces seemed more self-contained in styleowing -or at least referring - less to outside influences. One was Pierre Boulez's ''Derive,'' a very beautiful single movement bound together by long strands of tremulous instrumental tone. The three-year-old work is written for fluteclarinetviolincellovibraphone and piano (here conducted by Claire Heldrich)and in describing itone wants to celebrate both the power of its elegance and the elegance of its power.

The second of the two is even more recent - Elliott Carter's ''Esprit Rude/Esprit Doux'' for flute and clarinet. Hereintricately contrapuntal networks and very high spirits (often emphasized by the upper registers of both instruments) operate symbiotically. In keeping with the titleMr. Carter's high energy is interrupted in midstream by cooler layers of sustained and overlapping tones.
 6051,  1977, a, PARISFridayJune 3—The 27‐nation north‐south talks ended tonight with major oil‐producing countries and other developing lands refusing to agree to the. demands of the United States and the rest of the industrial world for continuing consultations on energy questions.

While the eight so‐called rich countriesof the north thus failed to achieve their principal objectivesthe 19 developing or poor countries of the south won some economic concessions in the form of pledges of assistance. But they regarded the pledges as inadequate.

The disappointment of both sides was expressed in the communiqué issued at the end of 18 months of talks whose aim had been to agree on a program of international economic reforms to help the poorer ‐countries of the world and improve the industrial countries'. relations with them.

The developing countries said “the results fall short of the objectives envisaged,” although they recognized that “certain progress has been made.” The industrial countries expressed regret at the lack of agreement on energy but welcomed “the spirit of cooperation in whichon the wholethe conference took place.”

 2481,  2005, a, Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.

Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lessonstudents share opinions about nutrition. They then compare the nutritional values of a snack product claiming health benefits with a candy product. Learning is synthesized by reflecting on the responsibility of companiesindividuals and the government in determining whether a product lives up to its claims.



Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Share opinions about nutrition and discuss the foods they eat.

2. Learn about a new chocolate bar that purports to have significant health benefits by reading and discussing the article “An Apple a Day for Health? Mars Recommends Two Bars of Chocolate.”

3. Compare a product that purports to have health benefits with a traditional chocolate bar.

4. Write a reflection paper that addresses the issue of corporateindividual and government responsibility in determining what foods are truly healthy.

Resources / Materials:

-pens/pencils

-classroom board

-four large pieces of papereach with one of the following statements written in large letters: “Strongly Agree,” “Agree Somewhat,” “Disagree Somewhat,” “Strongly Disagree”

-copies of the article “An Apple a Day for Health? Mars Recommends Two Bars of Chocolate,” found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20051101tuesday.html (one per student)

-resources for researching nutritional facts including textbookshealth journalscookbooks and computers with internet access

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Before classpost the four statement posters (“Strongly Agree,” “Agree Somewhat,” “Disagree Somewhat,” and “Strongly Disagree”) in the corners of the classroom. Since students will be moving around to stand beneath the statements with which they most agree for different questionsbe sure they have easy access to each corner. Read each of the statements below aloud and ask students to move to the corners of the room that best express their views on that subject. As students take their placeswrite the statement on the board. Thenask at least one student in each group to share his or her opinion.

-Foods that taste good can’t be good for you.

-Food companies can be trusted to provide accurate information about the health benefits of their products.

-Foods that benefit one aspect of health may be detrimental to other aspects.

-Eating a well-balanced diet provides for all of your nutritional needs.

Ask students to what degreeif at allnutritional value determines how they choose snack foods (chocolatecandychipsdrinksetc.)?

2. As a classread and discuss the article “An Apple a Day for Health? Mars Recommends Two Bars of Chocolate” //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20051101tuesday.htmlfocusing on the following questions:

a. What product is Mars Inc. beginning to market?

b. What health claim does the company state about the product?

c. Why did they decide to add plant sterols to the product?

d. How many daily servings of the product does the company recommend?

e. Why do they believe that their product will be successful?

f. Why are some nutritionists skeptical about the product’s health claims?

g. How have the company’s competitors responded to the release of the product?

h. Who is Harold Schmitz and why does he say that he is troubled by the competitors’ claims?

i. How might the competitors’ claims affect the sales of CocoaVia?

j. Who funded the scientific research on the benefits of flavanol in dark chocolate?

k. What does Bonnie Liebman mean by her statement that the “marketing is getting ahead of the science?”

l. Why are flavanols typically stripped from chocolate?

m. How did Mars Inc. resolve that issue?

n. Why did the company’s advisory board set a calorie limit for the productand what was the result?

o. In what other products can plant sterols be foundand why might they be considered healthier than CocoaVia?

3. Explain to the class that they will compare the nutritional value of a snack product on the market today that purports to have significant health benefits with a chocolate bar to determine the relative health benefits of each. To begindivide the class into pairs and have each pair choose a product from the Health Bar and Chocolate Bar categories (some suggestions are listed below). To aid them in their researchprovide students with the current daily nutritional guidelines (provided by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration at //www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/flg-7a.html). Students will work together to gather information and answer the questions for consideration (listed below and provided as a handout for easier student access):

HEALTH BARS

CocoaVia

Balance

Odwalla

Luna

Kudos

Nature Valley granola bar

PowerBar

SlimFast

CHOCOLATE BARS

Hershey’s milk chocolate bar

M&Ms

Nestle’s Crunch

Ghiradelli dark chocolate bar

Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup

Baby Ruth

Snickers

Three Musketeers

QUESTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION -What are the nutritional facts for each product (provided on the nutritional facts label)?

-What are the purported health benefits for each (if stated on the packaging)?

-How are the two products different and similar in terms of their nutritional contentcalorie contentsugar contentetc.?

-How does each product measure up when judged against the current nutritional recommendations set by the Food and Drug Administration.

-According to the food label and nutritional recommendationsdoes the health bar seem to achieve its health claim?

-Are there other means of acquiring the health benefits promoted in the health product? If sowhat are they?

-Based on the relative nutritional factsthe health claims and any other facts about the productswould you prefer to eat the health barthe chocolate bar or a natural health product?

If possiblehave students conduct a taste test of the two products and ask them to compare the taste as an additional factor to consider.

Toward the end of classhave students present their findings. For further discussionask them the following questions:

-Would you eat a product that claimed to be healthy even if it did not taste good?

-Is it reasonable for companies to claim that a product is healthy even if it includes ingredients that may not be beneficial to one’s health?

-What products do you currently consume that claim to have significant health benefits? Do you choose the product because of the health claim? If sodo you believe that you are acquiring the purported health benefits?

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: In the articleBonnie Liebman states “the marketing is getting ahead of the science.” Write a reflection paper (1-2 pages) that responds to this statement and considers the following questions (written on the board before the end of class):

-What is the responsibility of a company in making a claim about health products based on sound scientific research?

-What is the responsibility of the consumer in investigating health claims made by health products and the companies that market them?

-What is the responsibility of the government in regulating what companies can claim in terms of health benefits to consumers?

Further Questions for Discussion:

-Why might candy and soft drink companies invest in products with purported health benefits?

-How might current trends in health and nutrition affect a company’s decision about the products they produceand how they market them?

-What information do you look for when determining what foods to eat?

-To what degree do you consider the nutritional value of the foods you eat?

-To what degree might cost determine whether you choose a healthier but more expensive food product versus a less expensive but also less healthful one? Would you buy a healthier food if it cost more? At what pointif at allmight the cost outweigh the relative health benefits?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on participation in the opening exercisethorough investigation of their products in the group work and thoughtful preparation of their reflection papers.

Vocabulary:

Extension Activities:

1. Create a “How It Works” poster on the health benefits of flavanol. Where in nature is it found? What foods contain it naturally? Identify and compare a natural and a manufactured food that contain flavanol. How much of each would you need to eat daily in order to gain significant health benefits?

2. The article claims that heart disease is the number one killer in the world. What is heart disease? What genetic factors or behaviors contribute to heart disease? How is it diagnosed and treated? Does the disease affect a particular segment of the population (menwomenyoungoldetc.) more than others? What dietary guidelines are recommended for the prevention of heart disease? What activities or behavior modifications are recommended for the prevention and treatment of the disease? Write a report of your findings.

3. Investigate health fads over the last century. To what degree did scientific reports affect the designproduction and/or marketing of food products? Identify one health fad and write a critical analysis of its scientific basisand the impact on the food industry and consumers. Do current reports on health support or debunk the health fad you investigated?

4. Compare the nutritional value of white chocolatemilk chocolate and dark chocolate based on the current nutritional recommendations. Create a chart of your findings.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Choose a U.S.-based chocolate company (GhiradelliNestleHershey’sMarsetc.) to investigate. What products has it sold in its history? Howif at allhave the products changed or adapted to food trends? Do you have an idea for a new chocolate bar that might be a hit among your peer group and that reflects current thinking in nutrition? Write a letter to a chocolate company proposing your new product and how it might be marketed to today’s youth.

Civics- Why does the Federal Drug Administration require food products to list their nutritional contents? How does the agency determine daily nutritional values? Howif at alldoes the agency regulate claims made by food companies? Are food companies required to consult with the FDA before claiming that a product is “healthy?” Write a research report of your findings.

Economics- The health food industry is a multi-billion dollar industry. What companies produce and market health products? What other products do they produce or market? Identify one health food product and investigate its parent company. What else does the parent company produce and/or market? When did the parent company start selling the product? Is any rationale given for why it began to produce and/or market the product at that time? What was the annual revenue for the product for the first year in the market? What are its current revenues? Produce a market analysis of the product’s success in the market relative to the company’s other products.

Media Studies- Imagine that an ingredient in your favorite snack food was just reported to have significant health benefits. Like CocoaViathe product might also include some ingredients that are not necessarily “healthy.” How would you market this product? Howif at allwould you balance promoting the health benefits and providing information (or warnings) about the possible negative effects of the product? In creating your campaignidentify your target audience. Develop a campaign designed to reach the target group in terms of both the information you provide and the way in which you communicate your message.

Teaching with The Times – Read the Health section of The Times every week for one month and clip articles that report on nutrition. Do the reports offer recommendations designed to alter current dietary habits or that support existing recommendations? Do the reports reflect your own dietary habits? If nothowif at alldoes the information provided in the reports reflect and/or impact your own dietary habits? At the end of the monthwrite a reflection that summarizes how your diet compares with the findings and/or recommendations in the articlesand whether any of the reports have changed the foods you buy or the way you eat.

 6350,  1970, a, President Georges Pompidou's effort to repair French‐American relations after the strains of the de Gaulle era has been hampered at every stage of his American tour by the disagreement over Mideast policyandespeciallythe unwise French sale of 110 Mirage jets to Libya. The issue tended to overshadoW others of great importance in the official discussions in Washington last week. The protest demonstrations have obscured further the positive aspects of this visit.

President Pompidou was reportedly so upset by his reception in Chicago and by theprospect of an even more hostile greeting in New York City today that he considered canceling the visit here. This was of ficially denied; but whatever their reservations about French Mideast policyNew Yorkers should surely respect Mayor Lindsay's request that the French Presi dent be treated courteously during his stay in'this city.

In the long view of historythe French‐American differences over the Mideast are unlikely to prove as significant as the increasing area of agreement between the two Governments. As long as General de Gaulle is looking over Mr. Pompidou's shoulderFrench re‐entry into NATO's integrated military Struc ture cannot be expected. Butshort ofthatthe presence of United. States troops in Europe is. Wel comed and more French cooperation with the North Atlantic Alliance is on the way. The French attack on the American dollar is a thing of the past. Ameri can investment in Europewithin limitsis no longer opposed. France no longer proclaims a world mission of opposition to the United States. Attempts to dominate Western Europe alone or through a Paris Bonn axis are ended. Most importantFrance no longer opposes either the entranceof Britain into the Common Market or other moves designed to advance Western

New Yorkers who are determined to expreis pub licly their disagreement with France's Mideast policy would do well to keep this larger picture in mind.

 953,  2013, a, Nets guard Joe Johnson returned to the lineup Friday against the Dallas Mavericks after a three-game absence caused by a left heel injury.

Johnsonwho is second on the team in scoringhad started 55 straight games after joining Brooklyn in a trade with the Atlanta Hawks this summer. But he hurt his foot against Milwaukee on Feb. 20 and has been cautious about pushing it before it properly heals.

Nets General Manager Billy King characterized the injury as something similar to plantar fasciitis — inflammation of the plantar fascia tendon at the base of the foot. At the team’s shootaround on Friday morningJohnson said the heel felt good enough to test.

“There’s a little soreness but today’s probably the best it’s felt in a long time,” Johnson said. “I was able to move without no problems. I just keep icing and treating it and hopefully it gets better.”

With Johnson healthythe question once again is whether he and point guard Deron Williams can coexist productively in the Nets’ backcourt.

In Johnson’s absenceWilliams averaged 24 points and 8 assistsboth up noticably from his season averages. He scored 33 points against the New Orleans Hornets on Tuesdayincluding 11 in the fourth quarterwhich has been a period that he has normally deferred to Johnsonone of the best clutch shooters in the league.

Williams said Friday morning“If people are openI’m going to get them the ball.”

He added: “It was only three gamesnot like he’s been gone for months. We’ll just plug him back in and get back to work.”

Johnson acknowledged that the Nets’ offensewhich has swung through bouts of inconsistency this seasoncontinues to be a work in progress.

“Right now we’re really trying to find our identity as a team and who we’re going to be going into the postseason,” Johnson said. “We’re just trying to keep guys healthyget guys back healthy and see where it goes from there.”

It is clear Johnson’s presence makes Brooklyn a better team. He is a 38 percent 3-point shooter and a potent late-game scorer with two buzzer-beating shots already on his Nets résumé. He has made 9 of 10 field goals in the final minute of games decided by 3 points or less this season.

Coach P.J. Carlesimo said Johnson also helped the Nets on the defensive endwhere his size (6 feet 7 inches) allows him to smother smaller shooting guards and also guard small forwardslike the Mavericks’ Shawn Marion.

“This is one where Joe helps us in the size standpoint,” Carlesimo said before Friday’s game. “It increases the possibilities defensively for us in terms of matchups.”

Carlesimo said Johnson’s minutes would probably be limited Fridaywith the Nets playing again against Chicago on Saturday night. But in the fourth quarter of a close gamehe will assuredly be on the floor.

Where was Cuban?

Williams flirted with signing with the Maverickshis hometown teamin the off-season. In the fallwhen discussing why he eventually signed a $98 million contract to stay with BrooklynWilliams indicated that he was miffed that Mavericks Owner Mark Cuban did not show up for his recruitment meeting because he was shooting an episode of the reality television show “Shark Tank.”

“A lot of the questions that me and my agent had for them really didn’t get answered that day,” Williams said in October. “I think if he was therehe would have been able to answer those questions a little better.”

In a radio interview laterCuban said the Mavericks — who signed Elton BrandDarren CollisonO.J. Mayo and Chris Kaman — were “in a better position now than we would have been if we’d gotten” Williams.

This weekWilliams would not entertain questions about the commentssaying only that he is pleased with the way things turned out.

“I’m happy where I’m at,” Williams said. “I wouldn’t change the decision now and I didn’t really think about it then. I’m happy being a Brooklyn Net.”

 5754,  1985, a, Thirty-seven Mozambicans were reported killed and 62 wounded today when rebels attacked a convoy of buses under military escort south of here. It was the third attack of its kind in two weeks in a war that will not go away.

The conflictdiplomats and other analysts saidis paralyzing a nation torn by successive conflicts for more than two decadeswhere sovereignty is so eroded so that the Government controls little more than cities and outlying outposts.

It is a warone Western diplomat saidthat seems stalematedthe rebels unable to penetrate the cities and Government forces unable to extend their writ into the countryside of this nation lying along the Indian Ocean in southern Africa.

Mozambican officials said the latest attack took place close to Manhica70 miles south of this crumbling whistle stop and only 30 miles north of the capitalMaputo.

Matchup to Watch

Jets’ Offense

vs. Arizona’s Defense

For all their flaws — and they have many — the Cardinals have one clear strength: a stout defenseled by linebacker Daryl Washington (nine sacks) and defensive end Calais Campbellthat has forced 23 turnoverssixth best in the N.F.L. That is not a good matchup for the Jetswho are prone to turnovers and are 0-4 this season against top-10 defenses. Arizona ranks seventh.

NUMBER TO WATCH

7

The loss total for each team. But the Cardinals’ losses have come consecutively dating to Oct. 4. Arizona’s average margin of defeat is 11 points — nearly 8 fewer points than the Jets’. This is the first game in what seemed a favorable season-ending stretch for the Jetsbut none of their opponents seem inferior any longer.

QUOTATION OF THE WEEK

‘We’re playing a team that is a lot like us. They’ve had moments where they’ve looked very good and other moments where they haven’t.’

In small-town Arkansastwo boysEllis (Tye Sheridan) and Neckbone (Jacob Lofland)explore an island on the Mississippi River and make two discoveries: a boat wedged in a tree and a sun-kissed runaway who’s been living in it. That manMud (Matthew McConaughey)comes to rely on the boys as they supply him with food. He in turn supplies them with colorful stories in this coming-of-age drama from the director Jeff Nichols. In his review for The TimesA. O. Scott wrote: “Mr. Nichols’s screenplay is perhaps a little too heavily plottedespecially toward the endwhen everything comes together neatly and noisilybut he more than compensates with graceful rhythman unfussy eye for natural beauty and a sure sense of character and place.”

 4596,  1992, a, Houstonwhich had the best exhibition record among National League teamsdidn't quite make it to the National League pennant playoff -- the Astros finished last -- but Pittsburgh and Atlantasecond and fourthrespectivelydid.

Before anyone gets that farthe teams have to find answers to significant questions. Below is a rundown of the primary questions for each team:

AMERICAN LEAGUE

BALTIMORE ORIOLES With a healthy Glenn Davis back to bolster the offensethe Orioles turn toward their pitchingseeking three starters who can remain healthy and effective enough to start 30 games each. They didn't have one last year. Ben McDonaldMike MussinaRick Sutcliffe and Bob Milacki are the most likely candidates. BOSTON RED SOX With Carlos Quintana out for at least half the season with a broken arm and broken footthe number of players competing for five positions (three outfield spotsfirst basedesignated hitter) has shrunk from seven to six. Butch Hobsonthe new managerwould like Jack Clarkthe designated hitterand Tom Brunanskythe most likely odd man outto work out at first basewhere one of them could share time with Mo Vaughn. CLEVELAND INDIANS The neatest trick of the spring could be the Indians' convincing themselves that they can look respectable with all the young (make that low-paid) players they plan to use. Kenny Lofton in centerReggie Jefferson at firstJim Thome at thirdperhaps Mark Lewis at short may not be proven winnersbut can they be less respectable than the team that set a franchise record of 105 losses last year? DETROIT TIGERS While the hitters await a supply of bats without holes -- the better to reduce their major league high of 1,185 strikeouts last season -- Sparky Anderson searches for pitchers who will not allow the most hits and base runners in the majors. This is the timetoofor him to work with the mirrors he uses to manipulate the Tigers into the division race. MILWAUKEE BREWERS Of the 13 managers who did not have their jobs a year agoPhil Garner is the only one who enters spring training with nary a day of managerial experience on any level. The next five weeks will serve as a crash course for the former third baseman as he learns to deal with his players and hones his skills and implements his style of play. YANKEES Don Mattinglybaseball player by occupationwill try to become a magician this spring and make his disappearing production reappear. As desperately as the Yankees need to piece together a starting pitching rotation from a mass of mediocrity and find a third baseman to replace a platoon of buffoonsthey have to find out if their once-mighty hitter can resurrect his potency. TORONTO BLUE JAYS While they have added the veterans Jack Morris and Dave Winfield to shore up the pitching and the hittingthe Blue Jays must decide if a couple of rookies can further improve the team. Is Derek Bell (.346 with 93 runs batted in at Syracuse) ready to join Joe Carter and Devon White in the outfield every dayand is Eddie Zosky ready to take the shortstop job away from Manny Lee? CALIFORNIA ANGELS Whitey Herzog continues to resist the temptation to trade one of his trio of talented left-handed starting pitchersbut as the team's puny offense produces little spring punchthe general manager may finally feel the need to part with Mark LangstonChuck Finley or Jim Abbott for Ruben Sierra. If Bert Blyleven can come back from shoulder surgeryHerzog may feel more comfortable making a move. CHICAGO WHITE SOX Maybe Bo Jackson and the White Sox are fooling themselves. Reduced to the status of a mere mortalBo may not be able to hit balls out of the park consistently and limp around the bases. Gene Lamontthe new managerwho comes from Jim Leyland's coaching staff in Pittsburghis eager to find out if the real Bo can stand up and contribute to a possible division championship. KANSAS CITY ROYALS Listen to Hal McRaein his first spring training as a managersing"Getting to know yougetting to know all about you." Rather than experiment with his new playersMcRae has designated Gregg Jefferies for third baseKevin McReynolds for right field and Keith Miller for leftand now he'll find out if his decisions were sound (Wally Joyneranother newcomeris at first). The same goes for a new starting pitcherMark Davisan expensive bust as a reliever. MINNESOTA TWINS Tom Kelly is the only manager who has won two World Series in the past decadebut that won't make life any easier as he seeks a replacement for the departed World Series heroJack Morris. Kelly will scrutinize David WestWillie BanksDenny NeagleMike TrombleyPaul Abbott and Pat Mahomes. OAKLAND ATHLETICS Bob Welch begins the spring with a bad kneewhich doesn't bode well for the Athleticswho need strong comebacks from Welch and Dave Stewart on the mound and from Carney Lansford and Walt Weiss (leg injuries) on the left side of the infield. Just as importantthey will look for signs that Rickey Henderson is prepared to forget about his contract and play like the 1990 Rickey Henderson. SEATTLE MARINERS Given the nasty post-trade comments emanating from San FranciscoBill Plummerthe new managerwill hold his breath hoping that the Kevin Mitchell the Mariners acquired to hit tons of home runs in friendly American League parks behaves himself and takes his new job seriously. Plummer will also hope that speculation about the sale of the club to the Nintendo people or a move to Florida will not distract his maturing team. TEXAS RANGERS The will-they-or-won't-they talk about trading Ruben Sierra could get out of hand and distract the Rangers. If they don't want to lose the immensely talented outfielder as a free agent after the seasonthey should conduct their necessary business well before the season and approach the start with a settled team that has stronger starting pitching than currently inhabits the staff. NATIONAL LEAGUE

CHICAGO CUBS They have a new general managerLarry Himesand a new managerJim Lefebvrebut with the exception of Mike Morganthey have the same broken-down bunch of pitchers. If Lefebvre can find a way to establish good health and effectiveness (the Cubs staff had the league's worst earned run average last year)the outlook for Chicago could improve. MONTREAL EXPOS Tim Wallach fervently hopes that George CanaleJohn Vander WalEric Bullock or Arci Cianfrocco can be impressive enough to win the very vacant first base job. Otherwisehe will have to move across the infield. But that shift would probably be better for the team because young Bret Barberie would replace Wallach at thirdand he hit .353 in 57 games with the Expos last year. NEW YORK METS Jeff Torborg knows he can't count on Dwight Gooden to be ready for the start of the seasonbut he has only a feeling that Howard Johnson will be an adequate center fielder in what is the biggest gamble of his first year as the team's manager. Johnson's successful conversion would go a long way toward improving and stabilizing the woeful Mets defense. PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES They won one more game last year than the year beforeand some people already have them a dark-horse candidate for the division championship. Firstthey have to learn if a pair of surgically repaired starting pitchersKen Howell and Pat Combsare healthyand if a newcomerKyle Abbottis ready to step into the rotation. Then they have to make sure Lenny Dykstra suffers no aftereffects of his injury-plagued season. PITTSBURGH PIRATES All they have to do is replace Bobby Bonilla. To accomplish thatthey will return Orlando Merceda platooned first baseman last seasonto his more natural position of right field and shift Jeff Kingfollowing back surgeryfrom third to first. Those moveshoweverdon't guarantee that they will be able to replace Bonilla. ST. LOUIS CARDINALS Don Baylorthe new hitting coachhas the job of reigniting the bat of Andres Galarragathe new first basemanwho batted .219 and drove in 33 runs with Montreal. But who is going to instill speedmobility and general all-around adequate defensive ability in Pedro Guerreroforced to move to left field by Galarraga's presence? ATLANTA BRAVES Avoiding the pitfalls of a returning pennant-winner could be the most important thing the Braves accomplish this spring. They must attend to mundane matters as wellsuch as finding a fifth starting pitcher from among Mike BieleckiPete Smith and David Nied and deciding if Mark Lemke or Jeff Treadwayor bothwill play second base. CINCINNATI REDS Lou ("I don't really care if I'm liked or not") Piniella will make sure the Reds don't repeat the mistakes they made last spring in their lack of proper preparation for their effort to repeat as world champions. "We're going to work very hard and I'm going to be on top of them," the manager vowed. HOUSTON ASTROS It could take them all spring to sort through the 13 non-roster players with major league experience who are in camp. But they were brought in for specific reasons -- Pete Incavigliafor exampleto add punch to the lineupand Doug JonesRob Murphy and Joe Boever to bolster the bullpen corps. Some need remedial work. "We have a program for each one of them," general manager Bill Wood says. LOS ANGELES DODGERS Darryl Strawberry at first base? Everybody else in camp seems to be getting a chance to replace the departed Eddie Murray thereso why not? The preferred candidate is Kal Danielsbut he could have as much trouble making the switch as Strawberry would. Todd Benzinger is the safety netwith rookie Eric Karros having an outside shot. SAN DIEGO PADRES Players established at one position are on the move. Craig Leffertsa career relief pitcherhas asked for a chance to be the fifth starter because Randy Myers has bumped him from his closing role. Kurt Stillwellwho attracted little interest as a free-agent shortstopwill play second basewhere he dabbled for Cincinnati in 1987. SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS Seldom has a team been so eager to shed a player with Kevin Mitchell's production (109 home runs the last three years). Now the Giants will see if the pitchers they received will justify the trade by helping to improve their dreadful staff. Roger Craigmanager and tarnished pitching guruwill oversee the conversion of Bill Swift into a starter after he relieved in 71 games for Seattle last year.
 2504,  2005, a, But changes in politics and medicine have made it time for that approach to changethe authors of the article write. Besides Dr. Friedenthey are Dr. Scott E. Kellermanassistant health commissioner for H.I.V. prevention and control; Dr. Moupali Das-Douglasa former special assistant to Dr. Frieden; and Dr. Kelly J. Henninga special adviser to the commissioner.

In an interviewDr. Frieden said yesterday that the article reflected the directions in which he was already steering city policy. "We're getting out a million condoms a monthwe're testing a lot more people than we used to test," and the city has begun financial support for needle exchange programshe said.

But some changeshe addedcan be pursued only with more moneyor with changes in laws that were intended to guard the privacy of people with H.I.V. State law requires a patient to sign a separate written consent form for an H.I.V. test -- as opposed to blanket forms that permit whatever tests a doctor sees fit.

Doctors supply to the state detailed information on how individual H.I.V. patients are faring. But the state did not share it with local health departments until this yearand the agencies still cannot legally do anything with it. So while the city closely monitors the cases of people with many other diseasesand has a hand in managing their treatmentit cannot do so with H.I.V. -- though tens of thousands of people receive case management from private groups with government funds.

"We could tell you not just who has TBbut what treatment they're onwhether they're responding to that treatment," Dr. Frieden said. "I know who their contacts arewhether their contacts are infectedand if they're infectedwhether they've started treatment. All of those thingsI can't tell you a single one of them about H.I.V. But TB killed 25 people in New York City last yearand H.I.V. killed 2,000."
 1630,  2009, a, MIAMI BEACHFla. — Approaching the Fountainebleau Hotel here on Wednesday — a purely journalistic missionI assure you — I noticed a large contingent of Cincinnati Bearcat players were waiting outside.

That wasn’t the only thing I noticedas the swanky digs were filled with scantily clad women returning form the poolloud conversations in all sorts of foreign languages and just a wild medley of people.

But it was moving day for the Bearcats because Coach Brian Kelly knew that his desire for New Year’s peace and quiet wouldn’t likely happen. Diddythe star rapper whose fame transcends his many name changeswas hosting a New Year’s party at the Fountainbleau. Let’s just say that those tickets were a bit harder to come by than Orange Bowl ducats. (Tickets for the game were going for 99 cents on eBay earlier this week.)

Always coachingKelly knew when he saw a mismatch. He punted on his team staying at the hotelwhere they’d been all weekmoving them to a more remote and sedate location.

“It’s the Orange Bowlit’s exciting,” Kelly said. “You’re going to have those kinds of things. But I won’t get a chance to see the show.”

Insteadthe well-rested Bearcats will hope to put on one of their own.
 5641,  1986, a, John McEnroe was upset by both his opponent and the officiating todaywinding up with a defeata fine and a suspension.

Sergio Casal of Spaina qualifierachieved a 6-37-6 victory over the fifth-seeded McEnroe in the quarterfinals of the $625,000 Paris Open tennis tournament.

''You are the worst umpire I've seen in my life,'' the American player yelled at the chair umpireJeremy Shales of Britainas he packed his bag and stormed off the court after the match. ''You'll never work another one of my matches again.''

Within hours of the outburstMcEnroe was fined $3,000forcing a 42-day suspension from tournament play because he exceeded his limit for the year. If McEnroe does not appealthe suspension will take effect Nov. 10.
 3736,  1998, a, Don King was selling yesterdayselling the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis heavyweight unification fight on March 13selling Madison Square Garden as the ''temple in the mecca of boxing,'' but mostly selling himself as a bejeweled Job set upon by evil forces who had kicked him around but didn't finish him off.

This is King's post-Mike Tyson periodso he must sell the Holyfield-Lewis fight with ferocity. He is not guaranteed a profit from the promotionso he must cajole pay-per-view purchases above reasonable expectations to cash in.

''How are you going to sell two million buys? I predict for you two million buys,'' he bellowed yesterday from a dais on the Garden's arena floor. ''You say: 'What is this crazy guy saying? Is he out of his mind?' ''

Mind youno fight has ever rung up two million pay-per-view purchases -- the closest was 1.89 million for the second Holyfield-Tyson bout -- and Holyfield's pay-per-view appeal has faltered when he has not faced TysonRiddick Bowe or George Foreman. Lewis's pay-per-view appeal is unprovenat best.

 3600,  1998, a, AT the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgarya part-time plasterer from CheltenhamEnglandnicknamed Eddie the Eagle demonstrated with hilarious ineptitude how the agony of victory was never as much fun as the thrill of defeat.

Eddie the Emu would have been a more appropriate name. The ski-jumping skills of Eddie Edwards were more suitable to hopscotch than skiing. He learned to jump in oversized boots that required five pairs of socks and wore a helmet tied to his head with string.

If his glasses were as thick as Coke bottlesit was just as wellbecause where he was goinghe probably didn't want to see. The first time he hurled himself off a mountainEdwards said''I was so frightened that my bum shriveled up like a prune.''

Couch PotatoesUnite!

He finished last on the hill but first in the public imagination precisely because he was less an athlete than he was a tourist. If was as if he were appearing in an Olympic version of ''The Purple Rose of Cairo,'' a couch potato who walked through the television screen and found himself in the Winter Games.
 6099,  1977, a, Ilie Nastase won't have the United States Open to kick around anymore. The temperamental Rumanianseeded No. 7 in singleswas ousted in the second round of the tennis championships yesterday by Corrado Barazzutti of Italy6‐46‐4and then dropped out of the doubles shortly afterward.

“Nastase phoned me from his hotel,” said Bob Howethe assistant referee“saying he was so tired and his leg hurtso he was going home and rest.”

Nastase's defeat was a surprise—but not the only one—on a stiflingly humid day at Forest HillsQueens. On an afternoon that saw four former champions make an early exit from the tournamentStan Smithseeded No. 16bowed to Mike Fishbach and Fishbach's controversial “spaghetti” racquet6‐06‐2.

 3264,  2000, a, ''It seemed like a concept that had never been doneor done correctly,'' said Jennifer Fine28a co-founder of the Los Angeles-based Smartees Inc. ''We get e-mail from parents saying'Thank you for letting my daughter focus on what she wants to be when she grows upnot just on what she wants to wear.' ''

One expert still sees room for improvement. ''The more varied the roles that girls see women inthe better it is for girls,'' said Joan Jacobs Brumberga Cornell University historian and author of ''The Body Project: An Intimate History of American Girls.'' Butshe added: ''The critical thing for me is that they don't all look just like Barbie. Until such time as we can make professional women unglamorousor low-upkeepwhere their power doesn't depend on their hairdo or their high heelsthen I think we are sending mixed messages.''

Mrs. Finewho displayed pictures of herself in college with long blond tresses -- she called it her Barbie look -- started the company with Jennifer Hamlinwhom she met at a cocktail partyafter they found themselves commiserating about shopping for dolls and finding none that they identified with. They tested a number of concepts with children (one ideaSarah the Senatorbombed right off the bat)and rolled out the first dolls in October. Their motto? ''It's not what you look like,'' Mrs. Fine said''it's what you do.''

Not wanting to miss the dress-up boatMrs. Fine and her partner came up with an approach that they thought made putting on a little glittery outfit more ennobling. The Smartees can be modified to wear evening gownslike a one-shouldered purple satin numberbut they wear them because they have to attend a charity ball to raise money for some worthy causeMrs. Fine said.

That fell flat with one analyst. ''I hope the kids can grasp that subtlety,'' said Sean McGowanwho has followed Barbie for years for the investment bank Gerard Klauer Mattison. ''The level of maturity that is required to understand that a charity ball is not just a party is probably beyond the age group that likes dress-up toys.''

Ms. Chavez said she modeled the four Get Real Girl characters on friends of hers. One doll is African-Americanfor exampleanother is part Asian. Each promotes a different sportand when their Web sitewww.getrealgirl.comis up and runningtheir stories will be detailed there. While their muscle tone contrasts with Barbie'sthe dolls have similarly idealized features. Their motto is ''Be your own role model.''

To develop the lineMs. Chavez joined forces with Michael Cooksonfounder of Wild Planeta San Francisco toymaker. She still seems somewhat surprised to be in the toy business. ''I wish I had gone into the movementbecause I am so passionate about human rights,'' she saidreferring to her cousin's farm labor work. Instead she finds herself in the doll aisle and at trade showstrying to persuade store buyers to stock her company's products.
 267,  2018, a, Our turnout model

There’s a big question on top of the standard margin of error in a poll: Who is going to vote? It’s a particularly challenging question this yearsince special elections have shown Democrats voting in large numbers.

To estimate the likely electoratewe combine what people say about how likely they are to vote with information about how often they have voted in the past. In previous racesthis approach has been more accurate than simply taking people at their word. But there are many other ways to do it.

Our poll under different turnout scenarios Who will vote? Est. turnout Our poll result The types of people who voted in 2014 258k Barr +3 People whose voting history suggests they will voteregardless of what they say 273k Even Our estimate 275k Even People who say they will voteadjusted for past levels of truthfulness 291k Barr +2 The types of people who voted in 2016 305k Barr +4 People who say they are almost certain to voteand no one else 333k Barr +12 Every active registered voter 485k Barr +9

In these scenarioshigher turnout tends to be better for Republicans.

Just because one candidate leads in all of these different turnout scenarios doesn’t mean much by itself. They don’t represent the full range of possible turnout scenarioslet alone the full range of possible election results.

 447,  2016, a, Mr. Gatling’s exoneration will be the 20th time in the last two years that the Conviction Review Unit has helped to clear defendants found guilty in Brooklyn of crimes they did not commit. Charles J. Hynes began a similar effort as the district attorney in 2011but when his successorKen Thompson took office in 2014he renamed the unit and put his support squarely behind it. The review unit initially focused on cases connected to one detectiveLouis Scarcellawhose alleged misconduct has called into question nearly 50 murder cases. But as news of the unit’s work has spreadits reach has widened to include cases like Mr. Gatling’s.

Mr. Gatling’s ordeal began on Oct. 151963when a man armed with a shotgun burst into the home of Lawrence Rothbortan artist who lived on Bedford Avenue with his wifeMarleneand their two childrena 6-year-old boy and an infant daughter. According to police reports andlatertestimony at trialthe man demanded money from Mr. Rothbort. When the artist refusedthe gunman shot him in the chest.

During the investigationsuspicion first fell on Mr. Gatling when one of the Rothborts’ neighborsa felon named Grady Reavesinformed the police that he had seen Mr. Gatling in the area just minutes after the shooting. When Mr. Gatling was interviewed by detectives in the 80th Precinct (which was later absorbed by another precinct)he told them that he had been paying his rent at the time — a fact that his landlord eventually confirmed. A few hours into the interviewMr. Gatling’s lawyer called the station housebut the detectives told him that he could not see his client until the questioning was completecourt papers say.

Image Mr. Gatling in a portrait taken while he was in prison.

That same eveningMr. Gatlingwho was 6-foot-1was placed in a lineup with three notably shorter men. Mrs. Rothbort was called in to identify himbut did not pick him outeven thoughcourt papers saythe detectives directed her to focus on “the tall one.”

 2438,  2005, a, FORT A.P. HILLVa.July 31 - President Bush drew cheers on Sunday from a crowd of tens of thousands of Boy Scouts and their parents with talk about patriotismmorals and the role of their organization in creating leaders.

Mr. Bushin a 17-minute speech on the last day of the scouts' national jamboreeintroduced himself as a former Cub Scout.

The president said that several senior members of his administration had been scouts. He praised the virtues of scouting and listed all those in the Boy Scout law.

"Through the generationsscouts have made America a stronger and better nation," Mr. Bush said.
 4516,  1993, a, This weekthe Mashantucket Pequot Indians will open a new building that will double the size of their Foxwoods casino. But even before the expansionthe tribe has become the region's clear center of gravitywith influence that extends from town halls to the State Capitol in Hartford.

In a small town used to small businessthe casino's numbers speak for themselves. The Pequots made $26 million in gross profits in Julyjust on slot machines. By year's endthey expect to be one of the largest employers in the statewith 9,000 workers. Their new building will give the tribe 139,000 square feet of gambling space. They say this will give them the largest gambling operation in the Western Hemisphereedging out the Taj Mahal in Atlantic Citywhich claims to be the largest casino in the world. The power of all that money to buy up land has non-Indian residents worried.

Last monthin response to an inquiry from the three nearest towns -- LedyardPreston and North Stonington -- the Pequots said their long-term goal was to buy 8,000 acres and annex it to the reservationmore than quintupling the 1,850 acres of Federal trust land in the reservation's original boundary. The new lands would all but encircle the town halls of Ledyard and Preston.

"It's too much," said Ledyard's MayorJoseph A. Lozier. But Mr. Lozierwho describes himself as "pro-Indian" and "pro-Indian economic development," concedes that the growing power of the Pequots is not to be denied in the town of 15,000 population. "When you're making $26 million a monthit'syou knowwhat do you want this week?" Mr. Lozier said.

 4081,  1996, a, IN the five years since Yugoslavia entered its spiral of ethnic barbarismoutside diplomats have often laid much of the blame at the feet of two ambitious men: Presidents Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia. Each built his own political fortune on a base of nationalist passions that he stirred up among his countrymen when Communism collapsed.

Nowsuddenlyit seems as if both could be quickly forced out of power -- Mr. Milosevic by widespread street protests and Mr. Tudjman by cancer. So the question naturally arises: Would that help in the quest for a Balkan peace?

The answer is: Perhapsbut probably not.

The people who surround the two Presidents are indeed preparing for their departure. But it is far from certain that the virulent nationalismrepression and rampant corruption that have come to characterize their rule in Croatia and the rump Yugoslavia (which comprises Serbia and Montenegro) will be lessened.

One reason is that behind the two men stand groups of hard-line nationalists who do not flinch at the use of forcehave little tolerance for parliamentary niceties or a free press and will not be eager to share powergiven the privileges and wealth they have amassed.

 2587,  2004, a, I plan on drawing the invitation myselfwith Sissy's help. If a person needs to take a Valium before they comefine. I don't want nobody flipping out. If they feel like they can't handle itthey need to leave.

And I can't do it on a birthday. Becauseto methe birthday is the only day worth celebrating reallyother than Halloween. I'm trying not to go on a day that will make sadness happen in their heads.

I would nevereverevereverever in my life be put in a residential care homea nursing home. You're not even allowed to resuscitate me on the spot. I've got it set up. I'm not going to the hospital. Sorryain't doing that. No. They strip you of all your dignity and I'm sorry that they do.

My training with the elderly and dealing with death gives me a different attitude. I don't look at it as a negative thing. I've had a very interesting life. Life has been an adventure. I don't see why I should have to wither in pain. I've watched people wither in pain. I've bagged and tagged people a lot in my life. That's what we call itbag and tag.

In realityI'm not dying any quicker than anybody else -- because you never have more than just this secondand that's all you have. It's just right now. And you may be gone. Who knows? You don't have to be ill. A bug comes along and flies through your room and bites you and in a split secondyou know. Or anything. Walk in front of a car or anything. And that's the way I think about life. Soit's a lot easier for me to let go of it because of the way I feel about itI think.

If life is a continuumI go to the next step. If life isn't a continuumthen what difference does it make?

 3878,  1997, a, Sothis is how it is done.

It took the Jets less than three hours today to accomplish what they had done once in the last 642 days -- win a football game in the regular season.

And quite a season opener it wasfor the team and for its new head coachBill Parcells. In trouncing the Seahawks by 41-3the Jets put together a quality performance they had not demonstrated since a tantalizing stretch with some outstanding teams in the mid-1980's.

Indeedthey had scored this many points on opening day just twice before and had never won their opening game so decisively. Quarterback Neil O'Donnell was near tears as he held a football and described for his brother and sister-in-lawwho had a stillborn baby last weekhow he was ''bringing this one home for you.''

O'Donnell threw for a career-high five touchdowns -- two each to Wayne Chrebet and Jeff Grahamone for good measure to Kyle Brady -- and in a commanding performance connected on 18 of 25 passes for 270 yards.
 2120,  2007, a, Workers are rolling out the grassinstalling light fixtures and testing the water valves on the long-awaited $5 million African Burial Ground Memorialat Duane and Elk Streets in Lower Manhattanjust a few blocks north of City Hall.

The completion of the memorialwhich will formally open to the public in a Friday ceremonyis the culmination of a nearly 16-year process that started when human remains were discovered during a 1991 excavation for the expansion of a federal building at 290 Broadway.

“It’s been a struggle,” said Rodney Leon38the designer of the memorialwho first submitted his proposal in 1997. “But nothing compared to that of the people that are buried here.” The opening ceremony will start at the Statue of Libertyand then continue to Bowling Greenwhere the public will be invited to march up toward the memorial.

The 15,000 square-foot plot where the memorial is situated is but a small remnant of an expansive burial ground that served as the final resting place for enslaved and free Africans from the 1690s to the 1790s. As many 15,000 are buried in what is considered the largest colonial-era cemetery for blacks in the United States. The remains of 419 menwomen and children that were excavated were reinterred in 2003 in seven carved wooden crypts. All the bodies were discovered with their heads to the west and their feet to the eastso the memorial itself is oriented along an east-west axisoff the Manhattan grid.

Located in the shadow of a host of federal buildingsthe site is sandwiched between three barricades protected by security guards. “It’s certain the most secure site in all of New York,” said Howard Dodsonthe director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culturewho played a key role in getting the memorial to this point.

The African Burial Ground was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993. Last yearPresident Bush signed a law that made the site a national monumentto be maintained in perpetuity by the National Park Service.

The granite memorial has seven design elements – including a map of the world centered on Africaa triangular structure meant to emulate the ship passage from Africa to the New Worldand a spiral wall of 20 religious symbols from the African diaspora including images from EgyptHaitiCubanand Brazil. The granite used in the monument comes from Southern Africa and Canada. “It’s about the Old and New World stone coming together,” said Mr. Leon.

The spiral wall leads down to a map of the world centered on the coast of West Africawith rays spiraling outwards to the United StatesBrazilEurope and the Caribbean islands.

One neat architectural trick: If you stand at the very center of the circular mapon the coast of West Africathe acoustics of the memorial are such that your voice echoes back with a deep vibrato.

 3676,  1998, a, Long before Robert B. Catell and Dr. William J. Catacosinos parted company yesterdaythe two strong-willed utility company executives had established themselves as men of such different vision and personality that their partnership at the helm of the Marketspan Corporation seemed destined for trouble.

Mr. Catell61had been president of Brooklyn Union Gas since 1991 and its chairman since 1996. He is the jovial public face of a company that gives low-interest loans to struggling businessesseed money to rehabilitate dilapidated buildings and a postage-paid return envelope with every gas bill.

Dr. Catacosinos68was enveloped in an entirely different sort of glow during the 14 years he ran the Long Island Lighting Company.

His tenure was dogged by controversy over his frequent pay raises and by bitterness over the high electricity ratesthe highest in the continental United Statespaid by Long Island consumers. It is a measure of their deep enmity toward the aloof Dr. Catacosinos that Long Islanders still publicly scold him for not immediately returning home from vacation after Hurricane Gloria knocked out power lines -- in 1985.

 1789,  2009, a, Congressional Republicans offered qualified support Tuesday for President Obama’s proposed troop increase in Afghanistan but several senior Democrats took sharp exception to the president’s planillustrating the deep divide in the party over the conflict.

“I see no good reason for us to send another 30,000 or more troops to Afghanistan when we have so many pressing issues – like our economy – to deal with in this country,” said Representative Louise SlaughterDemocrat of New York and chairwoman of the Rules Committee.

The resistance by the Democrats demonstrated that Republican backing for the troop build-up plan will be crucial to compensate for Democratic defectionsmaking it likely that Republicans will provide the margin for approval when the added troops are subject to a Congressional voteprobably in the form of a spending bill next year.

While top Republicans welcomed what they portrayed as a belated decision by Mr. Obama to meet Pentagon requests for more troopsthey also raised objections to any withdrawal deadlines or Democratic talk of new taxes to pay for the military effort.

“Setting a draw-down date before this surge has even begun is a mistakeand it sends a mixed message to both our friends and our enemies regarding our long-term commitment to success,” said Senator John CornynRepublican of Texas.

Senator John McCain of Arizonathe senior Republican on the Armed Services Committeevoiced similar complaints earlier Tuesday and aired them again in a White House meeting with the president on the war plansofficials said.

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentuckythe Republican leader who has differed with the president on almost every issue this yearsaid he would support Mr. Obama’s plan but warned against a deadline.

“As this surge of forces produces results in securitygovernance and in capabilities of the Afghanistan Security Forceswe must ensure that the transition of responsibilities is based on conditionsnot timelines,” Mr. McConnell said.

Other Republicans said they needed to take a closer look at the details of the strategy and monitor upcoming hearings.

“Today we received a broad overview from the president about his plan for Afghanistan,” said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohiothe Republican leader. “This is a complex issue and plenty of questions must still be answered. The most fundamental is whether this plan will help us achieve success.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a noncommittal statement on the speechsaying “the American people and the Congress will now have an opportunity to fully examine this strategy.”

Senator Harry Reid of Nevadathe majority leaderwas more supportivesaying Mr. Obama “made a convincing case that sending additional troops to Afghanistan to fight Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups is critical to our national security.”

But the No. 2 Democrat in the SenateRichard J. Durbin of Illinoisa close ally of the presidentsaid he was not yet ready to render judgment.

“President Obama asked for time to make his decision on a new policy in Afghanistan,” Mr. Durbin said in a statement. “I am going to take some time to think through the proposal he presented tonight.”

Other Democrats quickly weighed in against the troop increasemaking it clear they were prepared to break with the president. “I support the president’s mission and exit strategy for Afghanistanbut I do not support adding more troops because there are now 200,000 AmericanNATO and Afghan forces fighting roughly 20,000 Taliban and less than 100 al Qaeda,” said Senator Barbara BoxerDemocrat of California.

Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvaniawho converted to the Democratic Party earlier this yearalso came out in oppositionsaying he was not persuaded that additional troops in Afghanistan would defeat Al Qaeda.

“If Al Qaeda can operate out of Yemen or Somaliawhy fight in Afghanistan where no one has succeeded?” Mr. Specter said.

Democratic officials acknowledged there is serious unrest among Congressional Democrats over Mr. Obama’s plan and said his build-up proposal is being greeted as something of a surprise even though as a candidate the president made clear he intended to shift military resources from Iraq to Afghanistan.

Other Democrats quickly moved behind the president’s strategy.

“I think the president has a sensible planboth short- and- long termto empower the Afghan people and allow for U.S. troops to complete their mission and come home,” said Senator Bill NelsonDemocrat of Florida. “The plan will allow 50,000 additional Afghan troops to be trained by next July so they can hold areas that are turned over to them.”

Senator Evan BayhDemocrat of Indianasaid: “No one wants to send more money or more American soldiers to Afghanistanincluding me. But we were attacked from that countryand 3,000 innocent Americans were killed. We must do what it takes to prevent Afghanistan from once again becoming a platform for attacks on the United States.”

 1692,  2009, a, When he began his career as a senior analyst at General Motors in 1984Fritz Henderson probably never dreamed that 25 years laterhis name would be on the top of a court document describing how the giant automaker landed in bankruptcy protection.

In an affidavit filed in New York on MondayMr. Hendersonwho became G.M.’s chief executive in Marchlaid out the factors that led G.M. into Chapter 11. The 98-page filing walks through a familiar litany of woes: foreign rivals with lower costsa worldwide recessiona spike in fuel prices and a painful credit crisis.

In sumMr. Henderson says in the filingG.M.’s only hope of avoiding liquidation is through the sale of the company to an entity backed by the United States government.

“There is no other saleor even other potential purchaserspresent or on the horizon,” the affidavit said.

G.M. took a number of steps to try to avoid arriving at this moment. It tried to make its cars more appealing to consumers and to get its legacy costs — largely related to employee and retiree benefits — under control.

When these failed to solve the problemit considered merging with Chyrsler in the spring of 2007and in the summer of 2008it explored selling businesses like its Hummer brand and sought outside investorsthe document said.

In the endthoughthe credit crisis and a continued slide in its market share left G.M. with only one optionMr. Henderson wrote.

He expressed confidence that the company would emerge from court protection as “an anchor for a new era of American automotive innovation and growth.”

 1280,  2011, a, Fans and pundits will surely debate the extent and the quality of the Knicks’ progress this season.

They have a winning record (but just barely).

They are on a pace to make the playoffs (as a lower seed).

They might win a first-round series (though it seems unlikely).

They have an undisputed star in Amar’e Stoudemire (but he is not LeBron James).

Yet the progress is both tangible and indisputableand a credit to Donnie Walshthe team presidentwho over two years dismantled a dysfunctionaloverpaid lineup and replaced it with a cohesiverespectablereasonably priced team.

As Walsh awaits word about his futureit is instructive to look back to the roster he was handed on April 12008which may look even worse in retrospect than it did at the time.

Six of the 15 players Walsh inherited are out of the league — not counting Eddy Currywho might as well be. Three others are on N.B.A. rosters but barely playing. That leaves only five players of any significance.

Without further adowelcome to “The Isiah-era Knicks: Where are they now?”

ThrivingMostly

Zach RandolphMemphis Grizzlies Had a brief and forgettable stopover with the Los Angeles Clippers. Now producing the usual gaudy numbers for Memphis: 20 points and a career-best 13.2 rebounds a game. Has not made the playoffs or been part of a winning teamthough the Grizzlies have a shot at the eighth seed in the West. Salary in 2008: $13.3 million. Current salary: $17.3 million. How he left: Traded (with Mardy Collins) to Clippersfor Cuttino Mobley and Tim Thomason Nov. 212008.

Jamal CrawfordAtlanta Hawks Won the Sixth Man of the Year award last seasonsimultaneously proving that Crawford was a) one of the better players Isiah Thomas acquired and b) was miscast by Thomas as a starting guard and No. 1 scoring option. Remains a key reserve for playoff-bound Hawksbut scoring and shooting percentages have dippedto 15.9 points and 43 percent. Salary in 2008: $7.9 million. Current salary: $10.1 million. How he left: Traded to Warriorsfor Al Harringtonon Nov. 212008.

David LeeGolden State Warriors Named an All-Star in final Knicks seasonalbeit as an injury replacement. Was the best member of a bad Knicks teamaveraging 20.2 points and 11.7 rebounds. Now a solid member of a poor Warriors teamaveraging 16 points and 9.7 rebounds. Salary in 2008: $990,000. Current salary: $10.8 million. How he left: In sign-and-trade deal with Warriorsfor Anthony RandolphRonny Turiaf and Kelenna Azubuikeon July 82010.

Nate RobinsonBoston Celtics Other than Crawfordthe only Isiah-era Knick to play a major role for a playoff team. Helped fuel Celtics’ Game 4 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers in 2010 N.B.A. finals. Now averaging 7.7 points and shooting .412 as the Celtics’ sixth man. Salary in 2008: $1.3 million. Current salary: $4.2 million. How he left: Traded (with Marcus Landry) to Bostonfor Eddie HouseBill Walker and J.R. Giddenson Feb. 182010.

Wilson ChandlerKnicks Thomas’s best parting gift — a talentedlow-maintenancehigh-scoring forward who always plays hard and improves every year. Averaging a career-best 17.4 points. Current salary: $2.1 million. Future: A free agent this summercould be used in trade for Carmelo Anthony or let go to make room for Anthony.

Approaching Irrelevance

Quentin RichardsonOrlando Magic Opened season as a key rotation playerbecame superfluous when Magic acquired Gilbert Arenas and Jason Richardson. Played 57 minutes in January. Salary in 2008: $8.1 million. Current salary: $2.3 million. How he left: Traded to Memphisfor Darko Milicicon June 262008.

Jared JeffriesHouston Rockets Found niche as versatile defender in his final years with Knicks. Niche in Houston is between 13th and 14th seats on the bench. Has made 17 appearances this seasonaveraging 7.8 minutes. (Side note: Thomasupon signing Jeffriessaid he would “balance the plane ride.”) Salary in 2008: $5.6 million. Current salary: $6.9 million. How he left: Traded to Houston (with Jordan Hill) in three-team deal that brought Tracy McGrady to Knickson Feb. 182010.

Renaldo BalkmanDenver Nuggets The hustle. The hair. The Rodman-like nose for the ball. There was little to enjoy about these Knicksbut Balkman’s frantic energy was something. He is more static now: He has played 44 minutes this season. (Side note: Balkman was drafted one spot ahead of Rajon Rondo in 2006.) Salary in 2008: $1.3 million. Current salary: $1.7 million. How he left: Traded to Denver for Taurean GreenBobby Jones and a second-round pickon July 282008. (Jones and Green were later waived.)

Eddy CurryKnicks Symbol of an era of overpaid underachievers. Peaked in 2006-7 (19.5 points a game)regressing ever since. Unable to stay healthy or in shape jeopardizing career. Has appeared in 10 games since start of the 2008-9 season. Salary in 2008: $8.9 million. Current salary: $11.3 million. Future: If Knicks cannot trade his expiring contract by Feb. 24they will probably waive him.

Off the Grid

Stephon Marbury Benched by Coach Mike D’Antoni. Refused a buyout. Took a buyout. Joined the Celtics. Played sparingly. Declined to re-sign with Celtics. Wanted better offer. Found no other offers. Went on YouTube. Ate Vaseline. Now playing in China. Salary in 2008: $19 million. How he left: Waived Feb. 242009.

Jerome James Often injuredalways jovialrarely in shape. Spent a lot of time on what came to be known as the Jerome James Memorial Stationary Bike. Presumed retired. Salary in 2008: $5.8 million. How he left: Traded (with Tim ThomasAnthony Roberson) to Chicago for Larry Hughes on Feb. 192009.

Malik Rose Consummate nice guyveteran of two Spurs championship teamstried best to infuse professionalism in a chaotic environment. Now a broadcaster for the Spurs. Salary in 2008: $7.1 million. How he left: Traded to Oklahoma City for Chris Wilcox on Feb. 192009.

Mardy Collins Steadyselfless guard. Not particularly good at anything. Out of league after failing to make Washington Wizards last fall. (Side note: Paul Millsap was still on the board when Collins was drafted in 2006.) Salary in 2008: $967,000. How he left: Traded (with Zach Randolph) to Clippers on Nov. 212008.

Fred Jones Won 2004 slam-dunk contest. Won 23 games in only season with the Knicks. Spent 2008-9 with Clippers. Has not been seen since. Salary in 2008: $3.3 million. How he left: Was not re-signed after 2007-8 season.

Randolph Morris When Knicks signed him straight out of college — via little-known loophole — Thomas said Randolph was like an extra first-round pick. Like an extra Mardy Collins. Salary in 2008: $810,000. How he left: Was not re-signed after 2007-8 season.

 741,  2014, a, TETENBAUM--Herbertwhose boyhood bout with oseomyelitisa bone-marrow infection that sent him to the hospital for multiple surgeries as a child and engendered within him a lifelong reverence for the practice of medicinedied December 292013 in Palm DesertCAafter a short illness at the age of 92. A retired obstetrician-gynecologist long active in medical educationDr. Tetenbaum had moved to the desert community from Long BeachNYsix months earlier with Sylvia Tetenbaum (nee Balopole)his wife of 69 yearswho survives him. He is also survived by his childrenBarbara Shepard of Las VegasNVwife of Curtis Shepard; Abraham Tetenbaum of Los AngelesCAhusband of Elizabeth R. Shafer; and Zelda YoderReadingPAwife of Mark Yoder. Additionallyhe is survived by seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Three sisters survive him: Esther HellerMildred Berwitzand Gloria Gimbel. He was predeceased by a brotherT. Leonard Tetenbaum and a sisterBeverly Schneider. Herbert Tetenbaum was born on March 251921at Beth-El Hospital in BrooklynNYwhich later became Brookdale Hospital Medical Center during the 41 years he served on its medical staff. He graduated from Chicago Medical School (CMS)which later grew to become Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science during his tenure on its Board of Trustees. Dr. Tetenbaum grew up in the Brownsville section of Brooklynthe third of six children of Eastern European immigrantsIsaac and Anna Tetenbaum. He worked at his father's dry goods store and attended Samuel J. Tilden High School where he led the swing band to a city championship. As "Ted Herberts," he played clarinet and saxophone at school dances and entertained at Catskill Mountains resorts during the summer. Dr. Tetenbaum attended the University of Texas at Austin where he majored in bacteriologyand drove the 1,750 miles back to Brooklyn every chance he got. He believed that attending school so far from home might give him an edge in applying to medical school as there were quotas in place restricting admissions for Jewish candidates from New Yorkbut his admission was not immediate. Even the Army turned him down during World War II because of physical limitations resulting from his childhood operations. He worked in a defense plant before landing a job at the Rockefeller Institute in Manhattan as laboratory assistant to Dr. Karl Landsteinerwho in 1930 had won the Nobel Prize for discovering the blood groups. When Dr. Tetenbaum opened the letter that contained the news that he finally had been accepted to medical schoolhe was riding in a subway car with his girlfriend Sylviawho exclaimed"Now we can get married!" They sealed the bargain with a kiss and received a round of applause from their fellow passengers. Herb and Sylvia proved to be a formidable team in Chicagotogether raising funds for the schoolwhich attained its national accreditation the year he graduated. When they returned to Brooklyn and purchased their first homewhich included an office for his general practicethe last thing in the world he expected was to be drafted. But the United States Armynow in need of physicianshad changed its mind and sent the growing Tetenbaum family to Fort Brooke in San JuanPuerto Rico. Thereby his own accountDr. Tetenbaum attained the rank of Major"fought the battle of the Officers Club" and acquired his medical specialty training. Back in BrooklynDr. Tetenbaum became a Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American College of Surgeonsdelivered thousands upon thousands of babies and remained deeply involved in the institutional lives of his schoolhospital and various medical groups. For his tireless efforts on their behalfhe was showered with recognition in the form of dinnerstributesawardsplaquescitations and statuettes. He especially prized his 1985 Distinguished Alumnus Award from Chicago Medical School where for several years he administered the Hippocratic oath to its graduating class. Dr. Tetenbaum earned the esteem and affection of all who knew him through loyaltygenerositydedicationa Borscht Belt sense of humor andwhen asked for itsound advice. He lived to see his children's lives reflect his values. Barbara became a psychotherapistAbraham a Broadway playwright and nonprofit executiveand Zelda an educator. His grandchildren and great-grandchildren gave him immense pleasureand three family "convocations" on cruise ships were among the highlights of his later years. Dr. Tetenbaum was an avid music lovertheatergoerhorseback riderreaderworld travelerextemporaneous speakermixologist and sports fan. He rooted for the home teamand when there was no home teamhe rooted for the underdog. Having fulfilled his own dreamhe encouraged and supported the aspirations of his family and friends. For someone who was not expected to make it out of childhoodhe ended up touching and enriching countless lives.

 3881,  1997, a, To the Editor:

Your Sept. 25 news article on health maintenance organizations that want ''legally enforceable national standards'' for H.M.O.'s puts me in mind of the notes left by serial killers: ''Stop me before I kill again.''

These health maintenance organizations are free to incorporate these excellent ideas in their own contracts nowmaking them enforceable by the time-honored remedies for breach of contract.

Far from placing them at a competitive disadvantageastute marketing should increase their share of the market. They should flaunt their adherence to these standards in all their advertising and heap scorn on the H.M.O.'s that refuse to do the same. Ethical employers will seek them out and boast of their high-quality health care in their recruitment ads. It would not take long before Medicaid and Medicare refused to contract with H.M.O.'s not in compliance.

Competition in the field has been based entirely on price until now. What a marvelous advance it would be to see health maintenance organizations competing on the quality of their contractual obligations. Government regulation is unnecessary. The patient is far more motivated to enforce his rights than some overworked bureaucrat.

 4159,  1995, a, About 300 Uruguayan infantrymensome carrying guitars and tea-making kitsarrived here todaythe first contingent of United Nations peacekeepers to assume duty in Africa's most persistent civil war.

It is the second attempt by the United Nations to resolve the Angolan war.

Rebels of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola signed a peace treaty with the Government last November to end the conflictwhich started on the eve of independence from Portugal in 1975 and has killed some 600,000 Angolans.

But the United Nations Secretary GeneralBoutros Boutros-Ghalirefused to commit peacekeepers until the hostile forces pulled back from their battle lines and the rebel chief Jonas Savimbi met with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos for a public handshake.

Battalions from IndiaZimbabweBrazil and Romania are to arrive in coming weeks.
 663,  2015, a, VARIETY PUZZLE — For those of you just joining usthe deal here is that this particular variety puzzle looks like a crossword and it smells like a crossword (seriously; put your nose right against the paper or screen)but it is only a crossword in the sense that it crosses words.

From therethe Puns and Anagrams puzzlesor PandAs as they are affectionately knowndepart briskly from regularAmerican-style crosswords. The clues are written in a cryptic crossword stylebut fear not: you can do this. The wonderful thing about PandAs is that the types of entries are limited to only two types. They are — wait for it — puns and anagrams. Sofrom a solving standpointif you are not sure what the clue is getting atyou have a 50 percent chance of getting it rightbecause you already know that you either need to groan or anagram something. Those are pretty good oddsin my opinion.

Let’s look at some examples. If you are looking for a toeholdI personally find it easiest to look for a clue that needs to be anagrammed. Your mileage may varyof course.

Each anagram clue reads like a sentencebut is actually divided up into parts: one part is a definition of the ultimate entryand the other part needs to have the letters changed around to make up the entry. Soat 42 Acrosswe have the mysterious clue“No gay anguish,” and the word “anguish” is the definition (We can assume that “No gay” is not the definitionbecause it doesn’t really have any meaning.) What five letter entry could possibly mean “anguish”? Just anagram what’s left: “No gay” anagrams to AGONY.

Drop that into the grid and feel very proud of yourself. You’d be surprised how much of the puzzle you can fill in that wayand then you can solve the rest of the puzzle based on how many letters you already haveplus you already know that the rest of the puzzle will wind up being puns. The only downside to that is that the rest of the puzzle will be punsand no one deserves to have to do that much groaning all in one fell swoop. But at least you’ll have completed the puzzle.

Ohand the puns: at 29 Acrosswe have the clue “Scams at the pump by Frenchman,” which I am dedicating to my friend and colleagueYahoo News national correspondent Matt Bai. Matt deeply resents any clue or entry that happens to be in Frenchmostly because he seems to have slept through his language classes in high school. But I would bet that even Matt could get this one. I needed some crossingsbut somewhere along the way it occurred to me that the name Gascon was Frenchand that the answer had to be plural because the clue (“Scams”) was plural. Let’s take a closer look at that: if you divide GASCONS into two wordsthe answer turns out to be GAS CONSthe very scams we were hunting for. I’m fairly confident I will be hearing from Matt later today.

One morebecause I think you’ll be entertained by this: 35 Across’s clue is “E taxi T,” which looks like gibberishright? It’s notI promise. Here’s how I got it: as soon as I saw the word “taxi,” I thought CAB. FirstI tried dropping it in between the E and the Tbut ECABT makes no sense. NextI looked at the placement. “Taxi” in inside the E and the Tso what if we said that literally? Turns out that the answer is CAB in ETor CABINET.

To recapPuns and Anagrams are a ton of funbut more than thatthey are a gateway drug to cryptic crossword puzzleswhich are multiple tons of fun. Give them a try.

 4327,  1994, a, There has been speculation that the Knicks are interested in Wilkinsalthough it would be difficult for New York to sign him. The Knicks are over the salary capand the largest salary slot they have to offer Wilkins is the $1.25 million slot vacated by Rolando Blackmanwho will not be re-signed. It will take much more than $1.25 million to sign Wilkinsan All-Star forward. But if the Knicks were interested in creating more salary cap room for Wilkins by making a tradeWilkins would be interested in the Knicks.

"I think adding Dominique to the Knicks would clearly make them the best team in the East," Steve KauffmanWilkins's agentsaid yesterday. "I honestly have no idea if New York wants to try and work something outbut other people seem to think it's a perfect fit. I expect the phone to be ringing off the hook tomorrow. We'll see who calls."

New York selected two talented players in Wednesday night's draftbut it remains to be seen how quickly Monty Williams and Charlie Ward will be able to contribute.

Outside shooting and quickness were two of New York's biggest needs. Williams can shoot. Ward is quick. Both players will need to improve if they are to play regularly next season. But considering that Williams was selected No. 24 over alland Ward No. 26the Knicks said they felt fortunate that both players were still available.

"The talent was pretty evenly matched after the 10 or 12 playersbut we had Monty Williams rated much higher than No. 24," said Ernie Grunfeldthe Knicks' general manager. "He can shoot and we think he's a fine player. And Charlieobviouslyis a great athlete."
 4405,  1994, a, A double bill of Ned Rorem's opera "Miss Julie" and Emmanuel Chabrier's one-act operetta "Une Education Manquee" ("An Incomplete Education") is to be given three performances by the Manhattan School of Music Opera Theateron Wednesday and on Dec. 9 at 8 P.M. and on Dec. 11 at 2:30 P.M. Mr. Rorem is to discuss "Miss Julie" in a free talk at 6:30 P.M. on Dec. 7before the performance.

The Rorem workbased on the Strindberg play about a sexual duel between a young noblewoman and her butlerhad its premiere in 1965 and has been revised and consolidated from two acts to one. The Chabrier piecefrom 1879is the tale of an innocent young couple in the Louis XVI period who arrive at their wedding night with no instruction but learn from love and instinct.

The performanceswhich have been staged by James Robinsonare to be conducted by David Gilbert. Tickets are $10 and $15. The school is at Broadway and 122d Street in Morningside Heights. Information: (212) 749-2802extension 428.
 5075,  1989, a, One way musicians express the joy of having Mieczyslaw Horszowski still among us playing the piano so beautifully is to think of different ways to describe the extraordinary span of time his career has covered.

The New York Times has been reporting on his concerts for 83 years.

He started playing in public before John McCormackAmelita Galli-Curci or Tito Schipa started singing in public.

When he first came to New York he played at the newest uptown hallCarnegie.

His birthdate is closer to Brahms's than to Ivo Pogorelich's.

If his pupil Murray Perahia keeps going this longhe will play at Town Hall in February 2043.

That is where Mr. Horszowski played the most satisfying piano recital this critic has heard all season - perhaps in several seasons - Sunday afternoon. As he approaches 100 (he will turn 97 in a few months)he only seems to improve; this recital was better than the one I heard in 1986.
 4284,  1994, a, Senior Administration economics officials began today to pare their list of 15 to 20 possible nominees to replace Wayne D. Angell as a governor of the Federal Reserve BoardAdministration officials said this evening.

President Clinton is expected to nominate Alan S. Blindera member of the Council of Economic Advisersto replace David Mullinswho was the Fed's vice chairman until his resignation in early February. Administration officials are now interested in finding a woman or a member of a minority group to fill the vacancy left by Mr. Angell's recent retirement. The White House and Treasury have assembled a list of such nomineessaid officials who insisted on anonymity.

The Administration is beginning to call possible candidates to see if they are interested in the Fed jobone of the officials said.

One person on the current list is Marcus Alexisan economics professor at Northwestern University and former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicagotwo officials said. Mr. Alexiswho is blackhas written mostly about economic development issues in inner cities and very little about broader economic issues. In a brief interview this eveninghe declined to characterize his monetary policy views or discuss his candidacy for the Fed.

 4517,  1993, a, Belmont Park will open its fall season this afternoon but one of the stars of the cast won't be there: Julie Kronewho suffered multiple fractures of the right ankle and severe cuts on the left elbow in a violent spill Monday on Saratoga's final day.

The 30-year-old jockeywho ran second to Mike Smith for the riding title at Saratogawas transferred yesterday from Saratoga Hospital to the Staten Island University Hospital nearer her home in Colts NeckN.J. She was listed in good condition after a surgical procedure was performed Monday night to stabilize the ankle jointalleviate pain and splint the punctured left elbow.

Krone was flown late yesterday afternoon from Saratoga to New York and taken by ambulance to the Staten Island hospital and placed in the care of Dr. Frank Ariostaan orthopedic surgeonwho will perform further surgery to repair the ankle.

Officials at Saratoga Hospital said that it was premature to gauge the impact of the injuries on Krone's career. But last nightBrian Morrisa spokesman for the Staten Island hospitalsaid"She won't be able to walk for three monthsbut could be able to ride within six months." He added that because jockeys are subjected to less foot stress than other athletesKrone should be able to continue her careerwhich already includes riding titles at Belmont ParkMonmouth ParkAtlantic City and the Meadowlands. She also became the first woman to win any of the Triple Crown races when she rode Colonial Affair to victory in the Belmont Stakes in June.
 3592,  1998, a, DR. ROBERT G. NEWMAN moved through the crowded halls of Beth Israel Medical Center at 16th Street and First Avenue last Tuesday morningshaking hands and slapping backs like a politician. He wanted to see how his staff was adjusting to Beth Israel's recent partnership with St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center.

''There is inevitably a certain amount of uncertainty with all of the changes around here,'' said Dr. Newmanwho is the president of the newly combined hospitals.

At first glanceDr. Newman would appear to be another buttoned-down chief executive of a large hospitalin this case one of New York City's three largest hospital systems. But he is a maverick whowhile not quite estranged from the medical establishmenthas raised more than a few eyebrows in the last 25 years.

He was an early champion of the use of methadone to ease withdrawal symptoms for heroin addictsleading some to call him ''the methadone pope.'' He advocated needle exchange programs long before AIDS brought them to the forefront of debate. He honored do-not-resuscitate requests for the dying in the fledgling days of the patients' rights movement. He broke from the ranks of hospital administrators to cut his own deals with unions. And most recentlyhe has established a clinic that caters to lesbians.

 4252,  1994, a, Holtz makes his case for recalling the 1989 seasonwhen Miami won the championship over Notre Damewhich finished second. Although the two teams had the same record and both won their bowl gamesthe strongest argument in favor of Miami was that the Hurricanes had defeated the Irish in a head-to-head meeting.

Nothing else but that game was really relevantHoltz recalledincluding what he thought was Notre Dame's tougher schedule and the fact that the Irish beat Coloradothe top-rated teamin the Orange Bowl. Ergoshould this year's calculation resemble that of four years agoNotre Dame should get the decisionHoltz said.

"If nobody's undefeatedthen you sayO.K.the No. 1 tie breaker in everything I know is match play," Holtz said. "The N.F.L. does it this way. The college conferences do it this way. And they did it in '89. SoI don't know. All I'm worried about is finding a way to beat A&M." On Natural Turf

He spoke early today at the Cotton Bowlwhere his players went through a light workout on the newly installed natural turf.

The natural turf was installed this year in preparation for next summer's World Cup soccer tournament. The playing surface should favor Notre Damewhich plays on a similar surface at home. Texas A&M plays on artificial turf. Pieces of the old plastic sod were mounted on plaques and given to Holtz and to R. C. Slocumthe A&M coachearlier this week as mementos.

Although the game has a possible impact on the national titleits tickets aren't the hot items they once were here in what some call the capital state of football. Seats are available. Rick Bakerexecutive director of the gamesaid today"we'll have a crowd of 71,000." Capacity is 71,456.

Part of the problem could be that the game is not only a rematch of last year's one-sided Notre Dame victoryit is the third consecutive appearance by an Aggie team that has lost the previous two. Another new wrinkle is the time of the kickoff. It will be 4:40 p.m.Eastern timeand it will be televised by NBCopposite the Rose Bowl on ABC. The weather forecast calls for partly cloudy skiesstrong breezes and temperatures in the low 60's.

 5047,  1989, a, But the gasoline tax has at least two big drawbacks that the already well-mobilized opposition has been pointing out at every chance. Firstit would hurt the poor more than the well-to-do; secondit discriminates against people in rural areas who must travel longer distances. Moreoversome experts argue that the yield from an increased tax on gasoline would be offset in part by a decline in other revenue caused by what they argue would be the new tax's chilling effect on the economy.

Despite backing from such diverse policymakers as Alan Greenspanthe Federal Reserve Board chairmanRepresentative Dan RostenkowskiDemocrat of Illinois and head of the Ways and Means Committeeand Mr. Lewis of the Economic Commissionit is uncertain whether more than a token increase can be enactedunless it is combined with some other revenue source.

Among the strongest critics of a rise in the gas tax are state officials who fear that a higher Federal levy will limit their ability to raise those taxes in the future. Gasoline tax increases are also opposed by the oil industrytrucking groupsroad buildersfarm groups and the American Automobile Association. TAPPING OIL

Imposing a fee on imported oil is especially appealing to some peoplenotably domestic oil producers. Such a taxsay $5 or $10 a barrelwouldlike the gasoline taxhelp the trade balance and address worries about the growing dependence on foreign sources of energy.

But the import fee has several drawbacks. One is that it would raise domestic oil pricesresulting in a windfall for the American oil industry rather than increased revenues for the Government. Another point against the fee is that it would put the American petrochemical industry at a competitive disadvantage.

Regional politics also plays a role. The Northeast and other areas that use large quantities of imported oil in power-generating plants would be adversely affected. On the other handan import fee cannot be entirely dismissed while so many Texas politicians - Mr. Bush and Mr. Wright among others - hold prominent positions in the Government.

Two other energy taxes may also figure in the debate. One possibility would be to devise some sort of broad energy tax based onsaythe energy content of a given fuel.

 1271,  2011, a, You might be wondering how Seattle fans are feeling about their Seahawks. It turns out that many are about as excited as most N.F.L. fans about the prospect of a losing team making the playoffs.

Danny O’NeilThe Seattle Times:

It’s fair for you to wonder whether an NFL team that has lost all nine games by 15 or more points has any business saying “postseason” let alone playing in it. So it’s understandable that most of you who responded to a poll on The Seattle Times’ website Sunday and Monday said you’d prefer Seattle lose the regular-season finale to St. Louis. But to hope for the team to lose? Really? You want the Seahawks’ division rival to come to Qwest Field and clinch that franchise’s first playoff berth in six years?

Seattle could lose 10 spots in the draft by winningand some Seahawks fans would like to draft Jake Lockerthe hugely popular quarterback from Washington.

In an earlier columnO’Neil wrote that reseeding and other playoff formulas would not necessarily make things better:

For better or worsethe NFL decided that divisions mean something. That’s why schedules are weightedteams playing every team in their division twice. If the NFL doesn’t want to emphasize division champions in the playoff seedingit shouldn’t emphasize division play in the schedule. So make your jokes about the NFC West. It’s a deservingly awful target. Just don’t fool yourself that there’s a simple fix for playoff formats.

Extra point: Maybe there is no simple fix. But surely there has to be a better way. The Giantswho crushed the Seahawks in Seattle earlier this seasoncould miss out on the playoffs with a 10-6 record. If the Seahawks beat the Rams on Sunday nightthey will be in at 7-9.

 2071,  2007, a, “I’d like to check you for ticks.”

I was taking three days to drive from Florida to upstate New York last week when I heard that line coming out of the radio on the second day. On the first day I had done the respectable thing and searched the dial for NPR and classical music; but they were nowhere to be found after I left Savannah behindand I was free to go where I always wanted to go anyway – to a country music station. You’re not going to come across a line like “I’d like to check you for ticks” anywhere elseand the same goes for an earlier line in the same Brad Paisley song“You press that bottle to your lips and I wish I was your beer.”

At first I had an academic thought: this is Petrarchanism updateda modern day turn on the convention – perfected by Francis Petrarch and passed on to John Donne and many others – of putting yourself in the place of an inanimate object that enjoys an envied proximity to your beloved. But I shook off the pseudo-intellectualism (at least for the moment) and surrendered to a pleasure that gets along quite nicely without the support of hallowed antecedents.



What is the pleasure? First of allthere is the sheer delight – self-indulgentbut earned – in the cleverness of the lyrics: “If I said you have a beautiful bodywill you hold it against me? (It’s hard to imagine a neater instance of a purposefully ambiguous pronoun.) Where I’d like to be is “sitting next to you sitting next to me.” (The repetitions and alliterations mime the closeness the singer desires.) “I turn your picture to the wall when I’m lying next to her.” (Lying and lying.)

The lyricsarresting as they aredo not stand alone. Usually they anchor a story – the motto of one station I had on was “A story in every song” – and that story typically unfolds in a three act drama marked at the end of each act by a refrain that changes meaning with every repetition. A recent example is Emerson Drive’s “Moments.”

In Act 1the speaker tells us that at the end of a long walkhe was about to cross a bridge when an old homeless man asks him for change. He complies – he wouldn’t need it anywayhe remarks in an aside – andclearly ashamedthe recipient of his charity declares“I haven’t always been this way/ I’ve had my moments” — some of which he then recalls in a longish verse.

In Act 2it becomes clear (although it is never explicitly stated) that our narrator wasn’t going to cross the bridge; he intended to jump. But the homeless manrecognizing “that look in my eyes” just “kept hanging around”; and it is now the singer’s turn to be ashamed and to say“You know I haven’t always felt this way / I’ve had my moments.”

In Act 3the singerwho has obviously lived to tell his taleimagines the old man sitting “‘round a trash can fire” and once again rehearsing his moments … to which has now been added the moment “When a young man almost ended it / I was right therewasn’t scared a bit / And I helped him to pull through / … I’ve had my moments.”

Not startlingly originaland a bit O. Henryishbut nicely satisfying. After allwhere else can you get wordplaynarrative structurepathosmorality and a small dose of social consciousness in three minutes or less?

You also get an entire culture orrathertwo. There is the culture of the country music industry itselfcomplete with a capital city (Nashville)a famous venue (the Grand Ole Opry)a roster of legendsseveral dynastiescelebrity marriagesnasty divorcesinnumerable rags to riches storiesostentatious displays of wealth – clothescarsjewelsmansionstheme parks. Then there is the culture country music describes and from which its stars all claim to have emerged – hardscrabblehard-drinkinghard-playing and hard-praying.

The emphasis is on family values and also on the many ways family values are eroded – by neglectcheatingcrimepovertyillnessdeath. The dominant tone is an unapologetic celebration of country – life virtues (honestyloyaltyfriendshippiety) in the company of a nostalgia for the daysnow vanishedwhen those virtues really flourished: She’s gone“gone like a ’59 Cadillaclike all the good things that ain’t never coming back.” (You could sayif you were of a mindthat country music is a version of pastorala genre that foregrounds a landscape that is understood no longer to exist.)

But if you enterif only vicariouslyinto the country music cultureyou have to swallow along with your enjoyment some stances and attitudes that might give you pause (or might notdepending on who you are).

It’s a man’s worldeven though a large number of the stars and superstars are women. In this world it is men who have the responsibilities and therefore the opportunities to default on them and then write a song about it. In those songs womenespecially wives and mothersare veneratedbut it is the kind of veneration reserved for forms of behavior – patienceforbearancesteadfastnesschastity – the singer can’t quite get the hang of. Songs sung from the perspective of a woman are often angry; they are about betrayal and the hard road every woman will inevitably travel: “Sometimes it’s hard to be a woman” (Tammy Wynette); “Here’s to the liars and the cheaters and the cold mistreaters” (Danielle Peck).

It’s a Christian world (and for “Christian” read “low Church Protestant”)where invocations of Jesus come as naturally as waking up in the morning. Think of it as Christian radio with all the sin left in. The religion is fierce and deepand its consolations acknowledge the pain and trouble to which they are a not always adequate response: “God is greatbut sometimes life ain’t good.”

It’s a white world. Not racist; there is no minority bashing; there are just no minorities. (YesI know about Charlie Pride and Cowboy Troy. Point made.)

It’s a patriotic worldgiven to flag-waving militarismand distrustful of foreigners and their ways of life.

It’s a world without ethnicity (except for the southern trailer-trash kind)and everyone’s name sounds like two or three bitten-off anglo-saxon syllables: George StraitClint BlackTravis TrittJohnny CashRandy TravisVince GillTrent Tomlinson. Many of the names could be reversed and they’d still work fine: Travis RandyTritt TravisPaisley BradGill VinceTomlinson Trent.

It’s a “classist” worldwith the favored class being lower middleand the disfavored class being any with pretensions. “They raised her up a lady / But there’s one thing they couldn’t avoid/ Ladies love country boys” (Trace Adkinsor is it Adkins Trace?).

And it is a world that knows everything I have just said about itrevels in itand puts it all into the songs. Never has a popular music scene been so self-referential. The singers caress the history they spring fromrehearsing the litany of the great singers – HankDollyPatsyWaylonLorettaWillieTammy – whose ranks they hope to join. (Another link to the pastoral; a pastoral poet always begins by invoking a long list of predecessors.)

Of courseI wasn’t thinking about any of this while I was driving. I was listening to the music and accepting its pleasuresone of which was hearing Vince Gill and Dolly Parton sing Parton’s gloriously sentimental “I Will Always Love You” just as I crossed the Mason-Dixon line.

 5262,  1988, a, A concerto can come into being in different ways. Most oftenan instrumentalist will approach a composer whose music he finds appealing with a request for a concerto. Occasionallya composer will write one for a performer whose playing he admires and present it to him.

My concerto for the cellist Janos Starkerwhich he will play in its world premiere Saturday at the 92d Street Yhad its beginnings at a dinner party in New York. It was a Sunday evening in October and we had all been to Gerard Schwarz's afternoon concert at the Y. He had conducted my Concerto a Quattroa work dedicated to himand then Janos Starker had played Dohnanyi's KonzertstuckOp. 12. At the dinnerthe hostess seated Starker and me at the end of the tableseparated only by Gerard Schwarz's small daughter. I had met Starker beforebut we had never talked at leisure. I had always admired his playing and found out that evening that he liked my music. Someone at the other end of the tableseeing us converse so intenselymade a joke about a Starker-Starer collaboration. We both laughedbut the germ took hold. We looked at each other: not only were our names similarwe are about the same agewe were both born in Europe but had lived most of our lives in this countryand we clearly liked each other. ''Not a bad idea,'' he said. Writing a concerto with a specific performer in mind is a good way to go about itperhaps the best. In a waythe performer becomes the symbol of his instrument. Music history reports many such collaborations; the Brahms-Joachim one is probably the best known. Years ago I asked a close musical friend of Bartok's why Bartok had never written a cello concerto. His reply still sticks in my mind: ''Nobody ever asked him to write one.''

People sometimes ask whether a composer considers writing a tailor-made piece denigrating. To dwell on the term for a moment: obviously the composer does not measure the performer's circumference or the length of his instep. What he is very conscious of when writing for a specific performer are that player's outstanding qualities as he sees them. Sometimes other elements enter that connect their lives.

When I wrote my Third Piano Concerto for David Bar-Illan I kept in mind his enormous technical prowesshis brilliant octaves in both hands and his fine delicate staccato touch in the upper register. While writing my Violin Concerto for Itzhak Perlman I was very much aware of the fact that he was born in Israelwhere I had spent nine years in my youth. For the jacket notes of the recording of the concerto I wrote''I tried to draw on that within me which is part of our heritage in common.''

That was for an art showhis first American exhibitionand the occasion for the new visit was also an art show. The one in 1925 presented a relatively unknown sketcher and water colorist in a now defunct downtown gallerywhile Friday's show drew prices of up to $4,500 for original gouacheslithographs and etchingsmostly of show business personalitiesby a now worldrenowned artist.

There was plenty of raw material for the caricaturist as 200 local beautiful and not so beautiful people in formal evening attire nibbled at quiche and sipped champagne and mugged shamelessly for the roving professional photographers. The guest of honorlooking like a patient St. Nicholas in his now‐white shovel beard and hairobligingly acceded to all requests to pose for pictures with individuals and groups and autographed purchased items and programs.

About $35,000 of Hirschfeld artfrom early Neo‐Impressionist etchings to oversized Japanese tapestries of recent yearswas sold at the evening receptionwhich opened a month‐long exhibition at the Harmon Gallery in nearby Clayton.

 4748,  1991, a, Deep downdance is an art of exaltationand "Lacrymosa," an astonishingly impressive premiere for the Joffrey Ballet by a 22-year-old novice choreographerEdward Stierlemakes the case in the most compelling terms.

In facteverything on the Joffrey's second programon Wednesday night at the New York State Theatersuggested the planets had come together as an auspicious omen. No one interested in great dancing should miss Tina LeBlancarguably one of the world's best ballerinas in "L'Air d'Esprit." Gerald Arpino's eccentric pas de deux is transformed into poetic fantasy on this program by her precision and liltand yet without Mr. Arpino's cascade of little gemlike steps she would not dazzle so brilliantly.

Mr. Arpino's rock ballet"Trinity" also looked full of energy on a big stage as a flower-power work for the 1990's. But the big surprise was how the 1932 "Cotillon," a "lost" work by George Balanchinelooked so at home for the first time in Balanchine's own State Theater.

Unmistakablyhoweverthe shock of the evening came from "Lacrymosa," which uses recorded music from Mozart's Requiem and features another rising Joffrey starJodie Gatesdancing elegantly and exquisitely. With the other leads -- Tom Mossbrucker and Daniel Baudendistel -- the Joffrey offered a ballet of sweep and power by a major new talent.
 3910,  1997, a, AS climate experts firm up their view that human activity is seriously altering the atmosphereone voice stands out in clarion dissent. It is that of Dr. Richard S. Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technologya shoemaker's son from the Bronx who has risen through the academic hierarchy as a leading expert on the physical processes of the atmosphere.

Is there truly cause to worry that emissions of waste industrial gases that trap heat like carbon dioxide could disrupt the world's climate?

Dr. Lindzen does not equivocate. ''We don't have any evidence that this is a serious problem,'' he says flatlywith precise dictionin a friendly voice that resonates strongly in his 17th-floor office overlooking Boston across the Charles River. A clutter of folders and paperscoupled with Dr. Lindzen's untrimmed black beard and hornrim glassessuggest the academic theorist he is.

His opinions attacking the formal consensus about climate change have made the 56-year-old Dr. Lindzen a bete noir to environmentalists who trumpet the dangers of global warming and a champion to political conservatives and industrial interests who minimize the threat. Admirers see him as a force for intellectual honesty in a highly politicized debate. Critics fault him for professing unwarranted sureness in a field of research rife with uncertainty. Many say he is simply wrong.

It seemed to produce a little unease in the first row of guest sitting up on the stage with himwhich included Gov. George E. PatakiAssembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Joseph L. Brunothe Republican majority leader.

But maybe it was just Rip Van Payback. After Mr. Spitzer first unveiled the “Day OneEverything Chnages” theme during his speech last June at the Democratic convention in Buffaloit was a spokesman for Governor Pataki who said“After almost eight years as Shelly Silver’s silent partner in AlbanyRip Van Spitzer today awoke from his slumber to talk about ethics in government.’’

Maybe now we can put the allusion back to sleep for another 20 years.

 4086,  1996, a, On the barren stage of the Libertywhich looks bombed-outMs. Shaw is illuminated by only a few unshaded light bulbs and the artfully placed spotlight. The image she creates is mesmerizingas is her fluid control of her slightly husky voice.

The performance is mesmerizingbut is this really Eliot? Andfor that mattercan such a piece work as theater? Or should it? I think notbut that's no excuse not to make the attempt. There is something about the communal nature of theater that contradicts the spirit of Eliot's isolatinghallucinatoryoften impenetrable visions and his densely packed allusions to ShakespeareMiltonVirgilSophoclesVerlainethe myth of the Grail andwellyou name it.

''The Waste Land'' is to be read at one's own speedoften haltinglyas one stopsgoes back and starts againin this way to gather momentum to make the next leap from the vividly particular to the abstract and apocalyptic. Unless you're a donthere's no other way to obtain a purchase on this most complex of modern masterpieces.

If you accept these limitationsand if you read the text firstthis ''Waste Land'' is something to which you can pay attention without feeling that you have failed it. You certainly should pay attention to Ms. Shaw and Ms. Warner. For some time nowthey have been stirring up the London theater scene with a succession of celebrated and/or controversial productionsincluding a ''Richard II'' in which Ms. Shaw played the title roleand Samuel Beckett's ''Footfalls,'' which so outraged the Beckett estate that attempts were made to close it.

Ms. Shaw and Ms. Warner take their work seriously.

'The Rehearsal'

There are some very good things in the Roundabout Theater Company's revival of ''The Rehearsal,'' the wittytartly sentimental Jean Anouilh comedyfirst produced here in 1963 and now being seen in a fine new English translation by Jeremy Sams. He is the man responsible for the English version of Jean Cocteau's ''Indiscretions'' (better known as ''Les Parents Terribles'') produced on Broadway two seasons ago. Though ''The Rehearsal'' lacks the roaring humor and rue of Anouilh's ''Waltz of the Toreadors,'' it is an exceptionally satisfying work. This productiondirected by Nicholas Martinhas beautystylehumor and the most cohesive acting ensemble to appear at the Roundabout in some time.

''The Rehearsal'' belongs to that group of Anouilh plays in which the artificiality of theater is compared to the artificiality of real life. The setting is post-World War II France and a chateau where some all too sophisticated aristocrats are putting on a production of Marivaux's 1723 classic''La Double Inconstance'' (''The Inconstant Lovers'')whose tale of innocence betrayed parallels the story of the contemporary play. If you happened to see the splendid Comedie-Francaise production of the Marivaux at the Brooklyn Academy of Music earlier this yearyour pleasure will be enhanced.

The victim of ''The Rehearsal'' is Lucile (Anna Gunn)a sweetunspoiled young womangoverness to the orphans who are housed in one of the chateau's more remote wings. The Count (David Threlfall)being bored by both his wifethe Countess (Frances Conroy)and his mistressHortensia (Kathryn Meisle)casts them in supporting roles and asks the governess to play SylvieMarivaux's heroinewho is somewhat more resilient and believable than Lucile.

 4483,  1993, a, There was so much talking between Ray Mercer and Jesse Ferguson in their Feb. 6 bout at Madison Square Garden that George ForemanLarry Merchant and Jim Lampleythe HBO announcersbegan to joke about the jawing.

ForemanMerchant and Lampley were commenting on the fight in a warmup that was not for general broadcast. At one pointafter Mercer had again spoken to Ferguson during a clinchForeman quipped"I think he just made him an offer to quit."

That is apparently what a grand jury believedtoo. Mercer32 years oldwas indicted on a sports bribery chargearrested in Indianapolis on Sunday night and arraigned on the felony charge Tuesday in Manhattan. He pleaded not guilty.

District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau contended that Mercer could be heard "repeatedly" on the tapes offering Ferguson a bribe to throw the fight. The district attorney said that Mercer had mentioned $100,000. Mercerwho lost the 10-round fighthad been guaranteed a title shot against Boweworth at least $1.5 millionif he were to defeat Ferguson.

 1717,  2009, a, I had no inkling of the brilliant new postage stamps honoring America’s first family of animation – the Simpsons – issued by the United States Postal Service in early May. At least not until Saturdaywhen the accumulation of stampless unmailed bills chez moi forced an emergency trip to the post office.

There they were. HomerMargeBartLisa and Maggie — each in a classic head shot against a little rectangular patch of electric color beaming forth with psychic and visual power. There was no soundmotionspace or plot to help them outonly colorline scale and lots of personality. I may speak more as a “Simpsons” fan than an art criticbut reallyare these not among the best American stamps ever? Disregard our age’s plethora of Simpsoniana – the juice cupsthe lunch boxesthe toothbrushes. Contemplate the chance of progress within the limited format of the postage stamp. There’s not muchbut Simpsons stamps make some. They pop.

Firstthe peerless expressionsdefined by Matt Groening’s inimitable thickish line. Homer is caught with mouth agape and tongue rippling — the panicked squawknot the famous “D’oh.” Marge purses her lips and looks confusedas if vaguely sensing one of Homer’s clumsy scams. Bart wears his sweaty busted-again grin. Lisa is all sweetI-tried-to-tell-you beneficence. Maggie’s glare suggests that someone is stepping on her nightgown. Her pacifier has two bounce commasthe only sign of motion in the entire series.

Secondchromatic wattage. The Simpson palette has always seemed as radical and subversive as the show’s social commentary and close in artifice to that of innovative colorists like Andy WarholBruce Nauman and Matthew Barney. Five amped-up hues suffice: egg-yolk yellowmagentaMarge-Simpson’s-hair bluedarkened chartreuse and lavenderplus important bits of white (mainly eyes and teeth) and touches of red. Subtle distinctions of tonality are made. Homer’s yellow head is seen against a slightly darker yellow background. Marge’s hair is slightly darker than the blue behind Bart. Red defines only Homer’s tongueMaggie’s pacifierMarge’s beads and the smidgeon of Bart’s T-shirt.

Thirdless is more. The “Simpsons” gestalt is boiled down to its essence and so is stampness. The images are stripped of detail except for the letters USA and the number 44 (centsthe new first class). No fussy engraved texturesno identifying names. This allows color to take over and the faces to pop out. Like a Richard Serra sculptureonly smaller and a whole lot cheaperthe stamps prove the adage that scale has nothing to do with size. They strike David-like blows against the Goliaths of American visual illiteracy.

It’s not news that the Simpsons work almost as well off screen as on. But these images still amaze. Slowed to a standstilldeeply cropped and confinedtheir portraits single out for tribute both the family’s indelible inmates and the breathtaking economy that brings them to life. I don’t know whether to affix them to my delinquent bills or have them framed.
 4529,  1993, a, IN "Baseball Without Me," an essay that appeared in last Sunday's New York TimesFay Vincent made a case for the need for a baseball commissionera position that has not been filled since he was deposed in a bloodless coup by the owners one year ago.

The fact isthe commissioner of baseball had become like the Queen of Englandbut without a handbag. And except for the pomp and ceremonyhe hasn't been missed.

This isn't meant from a personal standpointbecause Vincent is a decent and charming and delightful man -- the last of the romantics -- but in his role of commissioner he was a figureheadwhether he realized it or not. Just as were his predecessorsevery single one of themexcept for the firstJudge Kenesaw Mountain Landisthe one and only hardball czar.

And the momentor momentsthat each commissioner tried to assert some independence that might impact negatively on one or more of the owners -- that isdoing something that might cost them money -- each one eventually experienced a similar fateexcept for Bart Giamattiwho died after nine months in office. Each served at the whim of the ownersthough they strutted and displayed their all-powerful mythology before the fans and news media.

 3262,  2000, a, To the Editor:

The increasingly fervent claims of one or another of the presidential candidates that they are ''the true believers'' in one religious group or another and the increasingly frenetic claims of all of the presidential candidates to having a personal relationship with God are disturbingto say the least (Week in ReviewFeb. 27).

Some candidates are for the political aims of some religious groupsand some are against leaders of religious groups. Some are for ''life'' and some are for ''choice.'' I recommend they all show me through their actions that they have religious beliefs that show their commitment to provide for the common welfare of all peoples.

The Man Groupa London institution known for its computer-driven trading and famed literary prizehas taken a pounding in the eyes of investors and clientsraising questions about whether the $59 billion firm could be the object of a takeover.

The firmthe world’s largest publicly traded hedge fundhas suffered a crumbling stock price and poor market performance. On Tuesdaythe Man Group reported more bad news — more than $1 billion in client money left its funds during the first quarter of the year.

As the hedge fund industry continues to grow and expandthe Man Group has struggled to keep pace. Even when the firm has good news to sharelike a new partnership with Oxford University announced last weekit is overshadowed by irrepressibly negative market sentiment.

As a resultthe firm has been bleeding assets. It now manages significantly less money than it did before merging with GLGanother multibillion-dollar hedge fundin 2010.

Moody’s Investors Service recently put the hedge fund manager on watch for a possible downgrade. And a research report on the beleaguered firm issued Tuesday by analysts at Investec Securities was titled simply“Where’s the love gone?”

Driving the assault is poor performance. The firm’s flagship productAHLa fund that uses a proprietary computer-driven strategylost nearly 6 percent last year. So far this yearthe AHL fund is down about 2 percentand remains on average about 14 percent under the level it needs to hit before it can charge the lucrative performance fees.

GLGmeanwhilehas fared far better in 2012but not enough to make up for Man’s losses. Since merging with GLGthe combined Man Group assets have plummeted to levels beneath its premerger days. In early 2007before adding on nearly $24 billion in GLG assets to its holdingsMan had more than $70 billion all by itself.

What is distinct about the Man Group is that it is publicly tradeda relatively rare phenomenon in the hedge fund sector. While most hedge funds have only their investors to answer tothe Man Group must also serve shareholders. And displeasure with the status of the hedge fund can be expressed in a public way — the stock price — making the company vulnerable to short-term losses.

Man’s share price fell more than 5 percent Tuesday to just under £1bringing the market capitalization of the company to £1.8 billion ($2.9 billion). In the last yearthe Man Group — the sponsor of the coveted Man Booker Prize for literature — has been the worst-performing stock in the FTSE 100reaching an 11-year low last weekprompting speculation it could be a takeover target for a buyer looking to pick up an asset management firm on the cheap.

The Man Group’s chief executivePeter Clarketried to stamp out such speculation on Tuesday.

“We don’t feel we need a big brother in order to achieve our strategic objectives,” he told reporters during a conference call.

But Mr. Clarkewho received $7 million in pay for the yearfaced attacks of his own during a shareholder meeting on Tuesday.

Angry investors expressed their frustration with the firm and Mr. Clarke. According to a person in attendance at the meetingone investor pointedly asked: “Does it really feel like a $7 million sort of year to you?”

The Man Group’s problems are a cautionary tale for others in the industryand other hedge funds have also suffered after going publicincluding Och-Ziff Capital Management and the Fortress Investment Group. Och-Ziff is currently trading at less than a third of its initial public offering price. Fortresswhich was trading in early 2007 at about $31 a shareclosed Tuesday at $3.73.

“In publicly traded entitiespeople do seem to look for short-term performance,” said Stephen J. Browna professor at the Stern Business School at New York University. “The market has very clearly shown its disapproval of what is happening at the Man Group.”

Along with assetsrevenue and profits have fallen drastically since 2008. In 2008Man Group was pulling in about $3.2 billion of revenue and about $1.7 billion in net income. By 2011revenue sank to $1.6 billion and profit was down to $211 million.

To try to counteract the drop-offthe Man Group has focused on raising new money. Its marketing team has been a force in the world of hedge fund sales focused on raising the firm’s profile in the United Stateswhere it has been historically weak raising assets. Even with the firm’s dour resultsit managed to raise more than $3.1 billion in new money in the first quarter (even as the firm watched $4.1 billion in investor money leave.)

For its AHL fundthe Man Group charges up to a 3 percent management fee and a 20 percent performance feehigher than industry norms of 2 percent in fees and 20 percent in performance.

By contrastWinton Capital Managementanother computer-driven trading shophas flourished. Founded by one of the original scientists behind AHLDavid HardingWinton’s assets have swelled to nearly $30 billion. The firm charges management fees of 1 percent and performance fees of closer to 20 percent.

If there is a silver lining in the fallout from Man’s devastating yearit is that financial analysts are largely placing buy ratings on the firm’s stockconvinced that the company is worth more than the share price reflects. Man’s products and distribution channels for retail customersparticularly in Asiacould also be a major draw for a purchaser.

“Growing such exposure organically has proved extremely difficult and costly for many asset managers,” according to a note last week from a UBS analystArnaud Giblatwhich helped set off a round of chatter about a possible takeover.

Students at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland. Many people are applying for jobsbut companies say the problem is a mismatch between the type of skilled workers needed and the ranks of the unemployed.
 5071,  1989, a, Despite the encouraging findingsthe report warned that drug use is still rampant in high schoolswith 39 percent of the students saying they used some illicit drug in 1988and 54 percent saying they had tried such drugs at least once in their lifetime. The 39 percent is a decline from 42 percent in 1987and 54 percent in 1979the peak year.

As part of the studyabout 1,200 college students who had taken the survey when they were in high school were also surveyed. The researchers found a similar pattern in declining drug use among those older students.

Titled ''Monitoring the Future: A Continuing Study of the Lifestyles and Values of Youth,'' this 14th annual survey has been one of the nation's major sources of data on drug abuse. Although it was administered confidentially by University of Michigan researchersthere is no way to judge whether the respondents were fully candid.

The study does not taken into account high school dropoutswho make up an estimated 15 percent of the target age group. ''We really can't say with much certainty whether a similar decline in crack use is occurring among the high school dropout segment of the population,'' Mr. Johnston saidnoting that crack use is widespread among that populationparticularly in inner cities. Marijuana Use Still Falling

The study did not include drug use trends in specific cities or among specific racial groups. Mr. Johnston said he was still completing a fuller report that might include such data.

Among other findings about high school seniors were these:

* Marijuana use continued its long-term declinefalling from 11 percent in 1978 to 3 percent in 1988.

* The use of hallucinogensstimulantstranquilizersopiates other than heroin and nitrite inhalants all declined by statistically significant amounts last year. The number of seniors who say they have tried heroin at least once in their life remained at less than 1 percent percent after a decine a decade ago.

 4782,  1991, a, Although the district was supposed to close its doors yesterdaystate officials said they would keep it running through the end of the school year. Under the packagethe district would receive $10 million that was not used by the Oakland Unified School District. The balance would come from the statewide student drivers' education fundwhich was discontinuedsaid Fred J. Stewartthe state-appointed trustee managing the financial affairs of the bankrupt school system.

The loan carries stiff requirements. Annual payments will begin with the 1992-93 school year and will continue through the year beginning in 2002. In additionMr. Stewart said he and the district must reach an agreement over a teacher pay package by June 30 or he would have the prerogative of imposing a new pay scale. The Governor has long maintained that any state bailout must include concessions from the district's teachers.

The plandetails of which were finalized last night by Governor WilsonMr. HonigMr. Stewart and Gray Davisthe State Controllerwill be presented to the Contra Costa County Superior Courtwhich ordered the state on Monday to bail out the Richmond system. The plan also requires approval from the Federal bankruptcy court.

The Governor has contended that the state should not bear responsibility for a district that mishandled its finances. The parents in the districtwho filed the suit that lead to the current turmoilsay the state should assume responsibility for the education of their children regardless of the way the district was run. Shore Up a District

 3613,  1998, a, To the Editor:

Re ''Just Refinanced That Mortgage? Maybe It's Time to Do It Again'' (Spending ItJan. 18):

A worksheet accompanying the article looked at the time needed to recover the costs of refinancing a home mortgage. But it left out three important factors that lengthen that period and can thus make refinancing look less desirable:

* The tax deductibility of interest payments. Say that a refinancing reduces your total mortgage payments from $25,000 a year to $23,000. That doesn't mean you've saved $2,000. When interest payments are reducedyour tax deductions are also reduced. If your marginal tax rate -- Federalstate and city -- is 40 percentyour after-tax savings in this case will be closer to $1,200.

* The cost of losing the use of your money. Say you pay $3,000 in closing costs on this same refinancing. If you had instead put that money in a bank accountwhere it earned just 2.5 percent interest after taxesyou would reap an additional $75 a year. That money should also be subtracted from your potential savings from refinancing.

* The cost of your time. It takes many hours to gather financial recordscomplete the application forms for the refinancing and attend the closing -- typically held during business hours.

An accurate calculation of the potential savings from refinancing depends on a borrower's tax bracket and the age of the existing loan. Only if all relevant factors are considered can a borrower determine whether refinancing makes any sense for him.

That was the question that broke the silencebroke the ice and ever so slightly broke up Bruce Coslet at training camp today. With the first exhibition game against Philadelphia just three days awaythe Jets' head coach has other things on his mind than answering the quarterback question of the Super Bowl champion Giants. He even has a sizable quarterback quandary of his own.

"I hope to play all the quarterbacks," said Cosletwho has already indicated that last year's starterKen O'Brienwill get the start against the Eagles.

"If that works outfine," said Coslet. "If notdon't read too much into itbecause we're going to try to win the game. Our first priority always is to win the game. We want to see some young defensive players. We saw them in a scrimmage situation. Now we want to see them in a game."

The Jets lost a controlled scrimmage to the Washington Redskins25-16last Saturday at Lehigh University in BethlehemPa.as Coslet got a good look at his quarterbacks in 7-on-7 passing drills against no rush and 11-on-11 against a weak pass rush.
 1133,  2012, a, TAMPAFla. — The Yankees went through their annual off-field team-bonding exercise Thursdayan annual spring rite that Manager Joe Girardi plans for his players to increase team camaraderie.

In this instancethe players and coaches loaded onto buses and went to a comic improvisation theater in nearby Ybor City for an afternoon of role-playing and comedy. Don’t laugh.

Girardi kept the details of the event secret from the players until they arrived there.

“We have different games we’re going to play,” Girardi said. “What they don’t realize isthey are the entertainment.”

The club was open only for the Yankeesso there was no audience other than themselves.

Girardi laid out his strategy: the players would be separated into teams and would do skits organized by improv professionalsand the coaches would keep score.



“I think it’s good to get them all together and just see how they interact togetherand see the young guys with the veteran guys.” Girardi said. “I love it.”

Hours laterthe reviews started coming in.

“I saw Tex today in a way that I could have never imagined,” said pitcher Ivan Nova of first baseman Mark Teixeira. “You should have seen him. I couldn’t stop smiling. It made me think about how we come from so many different places to become teammates and friends.”

“I got one quote for you: Mark TeixeiraM.V.P.,” said the normally boisterous Nick Swisher. That’s allSwisher saidhe would reveal.

“I think all of us went in there with an open mind,” Swisher continued. “To have a great timeand it was just a great team-building exercise. I think that there’s a buzz in the locker room that we haven’t had in a couple yearsand we feel like we’ve got a pretty good squad.

“It’s like an old school field trip,” he said of Thursday’s adventure. “We get on the buswe go somewhereand the only thing now is that we don’t have to sign permission slips. But it’s greatskip does such a great job with this. It’s something so out of the normand I’m a major fan of it.”
 5104,  1989, a, ''People are of the perception that minorities raise third-generation hoodlumsthat people have no dreams and no goals,'' said Gina Smitha Schomburg tenant who works as an office systems analyst.

Insteadsay the people who live herethey are struggling to bring up responsible children and proud to live in a community they see as stable. On a salary of $34,000Earlean B. is raising two children of her own and two nieces she adopted after their parents abandoned them. She pays $850 a month for her four-bedroom apartment and sends her children to private schools. It is so hardshe saidthat she worries when one of her sons starts to cough because she knows she cannot spare the $50 to get him to a doctor.

''You're workingyou're trying to make a living,'' said the school workerwho is trying to get her youngest daughter into a private school. ''Anyplace else you go it's the same - you can't run away from it. When I go outI take my kids with mebut you can't always keep them. When they go downstairsyou never know what will happen.''

The people who live here complain about brazen drug dealerspoor recreational facilities for their teen-agersinadequate police protection. But many others in the neighborhood say they would not move anywhere else. They say they enjoy their proximity to Central Parkgood public transportation and a strong sense of community.

''I don't think anyone here has lived in fear,'' said Sylvia Sadlera 45-year-old mother of two children who has lived in Schomburg Plaza for 13 years. ''We are a close-knit community. If we need somethingwe can go to our neighbors. We want the same things for our kids as you do. I want a good educationI want them to work and strive and be the best they can be.''

This is not a communitypeople here saythat should be branded with the images of povertyfear and despair. There are several low-income projects in the neighborhoodand graffiti mar some of the buildings. But there are also several moderate-to-middle-income apartments like Schomburgwhere with a federally subsidized mortgagetenant rents range from $375 for a studio apartment to $664 for a four-bedroom apartment.

There are tree-lined streets where tulips bloom and garbage cans sit in tidy rows near brownstones under renovation. According to police and census datathe neighborhood is not plagued either by sky-high crime rates or wrenching poverty.

The restructuring also eliminates the day-to-day operating responsibility of co-founder Steven P. Jobswho had been general manager and remains chairman.

 3511,  1999, a, WHEN I bought the country acreage I now call homethe road frontage to the west of the house was edged by a couple of wild cherry trees draped with poison ivya random specimen or two of multiflora rosea few elderberry bushes and a thicket of sumac.

The neighbors counseled me to clear it outa formidable chore that would have required the chain sawheavy shears and hours of toil that I preferred to spend on other tasks that also needed doing.

Seventeen years laterthe fencerow -- the growth is called a fencerow even though there is no fence there and never was -- has finally made it to the top of the end-of-season chore list. Given a reasonable period of time this year between the falling of the leaves and the falling of the snowI will hack my way through the multiflora roses and elderberriesand gingerly remove the poison ivy vines.

The benefit of waiting is that I now know enough to leave the wild cherry trees alone (their fruit lures birds away from my blueberries)and to do nothing more to the sumac thicket than cut the wild brambles that threaten to obscure my view of it. What a mistake it would have been to clear out that sumac.
 4718,  1991, a, He has made getting it under control his personal New Year's resolution. "I am scheduled very fullywhich is one of the things we are trying to address in the New Year," Mr. Dinkins explained"to leave a little more time for reflection,study and whatnot." He added"I want to be as efficient as I can possibly be."

For the Mayorthe schedule is about controland not seeming out of it. PubliclyMr. Dinkins has been obliged to assert repeatedly that his administration has a grip on the city's depleted financesbudget deficitscrumbling infrastructure and crime. Repeatedly of latehe has chided senior aides"Let's just try to figure out what we're doing ahead of time."

Privatelypersistently -- and sometimes in salty language left over from his days as a marine -- the Mayor has upbraided the staff about his office's lack of control over his daily activities.

"He doesn't like the pressure of having one thing on top of the other," said one senior aide who asked not to be identified. "And he hates the unexpected." Those two prerequisites of his job were hardly eased by a schedule that throughout the year has placed him at two and sometimes three public events at once and cut short critical meetings. A Rather Remote Leader

Paradoxicallythe man known as one of the friendliestmost obliging of politicians (of his days as city clerkhe has conceded"The joke wasif I wasn't thereit wasn't official") has proved to be a rather remote leader. He has insisted -- because of time restraints and his own ingrained sense of order and propriety -- that heads of agencies report through deputy mayors. It has left many of them frustrated.

 1504,  2010, a, PHILADELPHIA — Henry Blanco has caught Mike Pelfrey’s last five startsand the combination has mostly worked wellbut Manager Jerry Manuel said he would like to mix it up a little bit and have Rod Barajas catch Pelfrey soon. Manuel said this before Pelfrey gave up six runs in four inningsso it had nothing to do with Pelfrey’s performance against the Phillies.

Manuel said the change would have come Saturday if it had been a night game. But it was a day game following a night game that Barajas caughtso Manuel wanted to give him a resteven though Barajas hit two home runs and a double and knocked in three runs Friday night.

He also has six home runs in his last seven games at Citizens Bank Park since leaving the Phillies after the 2007 season.

Blanco had one of the Mets’ three hits off Roy Halladay on Saturdaya double in the third inning. He was sacrificed to third but was stranded there after Angel Pagan drilled a line drive up the middle that was caught by Chase Utley at second.

Some other interesting tidbits that came out of Saturday’s game:

¶Jason Bay singled in the second inning to extend his hitting streak to eight games.

¶Roy Halladay has five complete games in his last eight starts dating to last season with the Blue Jays.

¶With 45,264 people in attendanceCitizens Bank Park was sold out for its 50th consecutive regular-season game.

 3581,  1998, a, To the Editor:

Edward Morgan (Op-EdDec. 25) argues that religion needs to be put back into government and public life and that many of our social ills are the result of not having done so. But ours is the most religious of the industrialized countries. Yet we rank poorly by many measures of social well-being -- for examplepovertyhomelessnesschild welfareand so on.

Religion may well console some individuals at the bottom of the heap and may help some lift themselves out of despair. But the other side of the coin is the piety and callousness that leaves salvation to the churches and individual effort while dismantling the government programs that have protected those at the bottom.

The poor would benefit more from the repair and restoration of a civilized social welfare policyincluding a progressive tax schedulethan from government promotion of religion.

The movieabout three black teenagers growing up amid gang violence in South-Central Los Angelesmade Singletonthen 24the youngest person and the first African-American nominated for a best directing Oscar. The movie debuted in 1991 as the police beating of Rodney King dominated headlines.

Singleton “filled his characters’ lives with warmth and humor even as they were constantly menacedand often destroyedby violence,” the New York Times critic A.O. Scott wrote in an appraisal of the filmmaker's work. “He infused familiar coming-of-age and gangster-movie tropes with a rare authenticity.”

The director “accomplished what all creators strive to. He entertainedbut also inspired a generation of audiences,” Jane Rosenthala co-founder of the festivalsaid in a statement. “We want to celebrate him as we consider the legacy that he has left behind.”

 3586,  1998, a, To the Editor: Apropos of ''A Free Museum Is Harder to Find'' (Dec. 28)my wife and I have known that United States citizens are not eligible for Italy's free entry for over-65's since we first encountered the policy in 1988. Howeverwe have occasionally gotten the reductionmostly by keeping our mouths shutor sometimes by muttering ''vecchio'' (''aged'')or ''I speak English'' (British subjects get the discount).

On reading Betsy Wade's articleI thought immediately of the time we visited the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome. The young woman behind the desk could see us coming and I could see her reach for a pad of ''old folks'' tickets and get ready to stamp them before we reached the desk. She stamped one and had her hand raised to stamp the second when my wife said (in rather too-loud Brooklyn English)''How did she know we're old?'' The hand pauseda scowl appeareda combination sigh-hiss emerged and the stamp banged down on the second pass. We rapidly fled to the interior.

Actuallyas noted in the articlethe free-entry rule applies only to Italian state museums. Others set their own rules. Probably the strangest was at the Museo Barracco di Scultura Antica in Rome. Therewe had to show our passportssign affidavits and write an entry in a log book before being granted free admission as senior citizens.

 1443,  2010, a, JACKSONVILLEFla. — Even with one more winBobby Bowden couldn’t gain ground on Penn State’s Joe Paternothe coach with the most career victories in the Football Bowl Subdivision. At the same time Florida State was beating West Virginia33-21in Bowden’s swan song at the Gator BowlPaterno’s Nittany Lions were holding off L.S.U.19-17at the Capital One Bowl in Orlando.

Paterno82has 394 victories. Bowden80ended his 55-year coaching career with 389 but stands to lose as many as 14 of those because of academic misconduct.

“I wanted 400 so bad,” Bowden said“because I felt likewellJoe is going to beat me. When they took away those gamesJoe is going to beat me. And if I could just get to 400it would be me and him. I could hang around with him and follow him around a little bit.”

Bowdenwho has coached the past 34 seasons at Florida Statewas forced to resign at the end of the Seminoles’ 6-6 regular season. He will be replaced by the offensive coordinatorJimbo Fisher. Bowden wished to coach one more year so he could reach the 400-win milestone. Despite not being able to go out on his own termsBowden said he is at peace.

“I’m not ate up with coaching football at my life,” he said. “I have got 80 years in. I wanted 81but I got 80 years in. I wanted more and couldn’t have it. They wouldn’t let me have it.”

He added: “I have always felt likeyou can’t take it with you. If I want more games than anybody elsewhich I’m notJoe isso what? When I dieI can’t take it with me. There are things in life more important. There are just things more important than that to me. That’s why I’m at peace with myself.”

He said he was reminded after the game that victories aren’t everything. In the locker roomBowden’s players asked him to sign their jerseys and he was able to spend a few minutes with former players like Derrick Brooks and Chris Weinkeone of two Heisman Trophy winners that Bowden coached.

“It is a great closeness there,” Bowden said. “It’s is like a family. And I really appreciate all those boys coming back to the game.”
 3990,  1996, a, NorI thinkcan the success of "Twister" be explained by the hard-sell techniques -- some call it synergy -- of modern media conglomerates. While Time Warnerwhose Warner Brothers co-produced the moviealso publishes two magazinesTime and Entertainment Weeklythat heralded "Twister" with tie-in coversthe film has continued to draw colossal crowds week after weekeven holding its own against the formidable competition of Tom Cruise's biceps. People just can't get enough of a weatherman who gets so turned on by chasing tornadoes that he's willing to ditch his fiancee if she insists on standing between him and his Doppler radar.

Americans and weathermen -- this truly wasuntil "Twister," the love that dare not speak its name. But the romance has been bubbling to the surface more and more feverishly in recent yearsand not just on that cable outlet for hard-core meteorological pornthe Weather Channel. Weathermenonce merely an adjunct to the morning network news showsare now their ubiquitous court jesters -- with each network competing to cast the role with the most Falstaffian possible combination of mirth and girth. And as the network weathermen get us out of bedso anotherlocal crewsometimes slimmer and sometimes femaletucks us in each night: the weather report is often held back to the very end of the 11 o'clock newsas if it were an irresistible bedtime story.

No matter how high-tech the equipment surrounding these weathermenlocal or networktheir predictions are no more foolproof than they were back in the stone age before DopplerStormwatch and wind-chill factor. But that's precisely how we like it. In "Twister," when the camera actually enters a tornadowe hear a heavenly choir; a line of dialogue has already announced we are in the presence of the apocalyptic "thunder of God." The more inaccurate the weather report in the face of increased scientific expertisethe more we can be reassured that there are still some things science can't controlno matter how advanced our knowledge. America is the most religious country in the world as measured by church attendanceand accurate weather reports could set off the worst crisis of faith since Tammy Faye Bakker was stripped of her eyelashes.

If "Twister 2" is going to surpass "Twister," howeverthey should dump that square-jawed weatherman and give the audience what it really wants in a meteorological matinee idol: Al Roker.

Defense of Marriage Act Redux: Last week in this space I incorrectly stated that the wife Bob Dole divorced after 24 years of marriage was his nursewhen in fact she was an occupational therapist he met as he was leaving the hospital. Nor is she to be confused with the second Mrs. Dolewho is also no nursedespite her considerable service to the American Red Cross.

In this clipyou won’t see Big Bird cast as Roger Sterling or Elmo as Pete Campbellbut you will learn valuable differences about the emotions of madsad and happy.

 1662,  2009, a, I’ve received all my decisionsand I’m thrilled to have been admitted to all the schools to which I applied. As perverse as it may soundthis is quite a dilemma itself. From a financial standpointfor examplemy coming from a reasonably well-off family means my offers have been little to nil thus far. Princeton University found me ineligible for need-based aid and I suspect the others will be limited to several thousand dollars at maximum.

This all makes the Morehead-Cain Scholars Program at the University of North CarolinaChapel Hill a more compelling option. While I don’t doubt my ability to pay for college with these offersthe debt they incur is substantial and places a significant handicap on graduates. As a full-ride scholarshipthe Morehead removes that burden and opens up quite a few possibilities during and after my undergraduate years.

Above all elsethoughI don’t want to make my decision based on finances. I have essentially a choice among three environments over the next four years: an Ivy League school; a school like Reed or the University of Chicago; and the Morehead at Chapel Hill. Attending a member of the Ivy League would connect me to a vast number of intelligentengaged peoplenot to mention the resources of some extraordinary universities. Howeveras discussed in one of the articles that shaped my college process“The Disadvantages of an Elite Education,” I dislike the self-reinforcing superiority that lurks beneath the facade of these schools. The authorWilliam Deresiewiczwrites in The American Scholar,

“As two dozen years at Yale and Columbia have shown meelite colleges relentlessly encourage their students to flatter themselves for being thereand for what being there can do for them.”

I had a wonderful time visiting Yale in particular last spring and didn’t perceive this overtlybut I’m concerned.

Reed and the University of Chicago may be more overtly intellectualbut an education there has some shortcomings. While these schools are tremendous in their own rightthe institutions don’t offer the same flexibility and possibilities for creativeself-directed learning as the Morehead. Universities and college-preparatory programs excel at producing process-oriented studentsbut very few challenge them to take responsibility for their own learning and initiatives. To mebeing an undergraduate entails the assumption of riskdeveloping imaginative thinkingand taking ownership of one’s work — skills that prepare me to create rather than follow or comply.

I have until April 13th to replyhowevermeaning two more difficult weeks to decide.

 524,  2016, a, Sometimes It’s Too Much

Unlike his brotherGerardo wasn’t prone to violence when his pills ran out. By Julywhen most of his medications were gonehe drifted into his own worldstanding calmly in a corner for long spells as the rest of the family sat in the living roomwatching television. He would look up and answer a question now and thenbut it was as if he were dreaming elsewhere.

“We call him our Swiss Guard,” Mario said wryly.

Waiting in line and scrounging for medicines are not the only daily struggles for the Simeone family. The real trial is holding the strainedat times violenthousehold together.

Accel still hears voices in his headwhich now tell him that he can no longer sleep in his bed. He has moved to his parents’ room. Mario and Evelin’s grown son spends the night with them.

Guilt haunts Evelin. She is troubled that she has not searched as hard as she can for medicine for Gerardo.

“I am tired,” she said. “This is too much sometimes.”

She began to cry and walked away. Accel looked upsensing something was wrong.

“It’s allergies again,” she told him.

The tiny house feels crampedwith a sense of cabin fever. When there is enough medicine to clear his mindAccel takes to writing new hip-hop lyrics. One is about his relationship with Gerardo. Anothercalled “The Lights Are Out,” tells of the constant blackouts in his neighborhood.

Accel opened his bedroom door and pointed at lyrics written on the wall. Every inch has been covered by his frenetic writing.
 1847,  2008, a, Updated12:26 p.m. | At first blushthe statement almost read like an April Fool’s Day joke. The New York State Commission on Investigation issued a press release this morning saying that it was “investigating the investigations” surrounding former Gov. Eliot Spitzer’s efforts to use State Police records to try to tarnish the State Senate majority leaderJoseph L. Bruno. But it turns out that the commission is quite serious.



After allin a state that has been known for political scandal latelythere are an awful lot of investigations going on. Alfred D. Lernerthe chairman of the commission since 2005said in a statement:

In August 2007the State of New York Commission of Investigation issued a statement noting the various investigations into the so-called Troopergate matter by the attorney generalthe inspector generalthe Public Integrity (formerly Ethics) Commissionthe Albany County district attorneyand the Senate Investigations Committee. We said then that we were closely following these inquiries and had initiated our own preliminary review. We also said in our August statement that “in order to avoid the danger of conflicting investigationswith the inherent possibility of impeding one or all of themwe are postponing any further investigation until the district attorney has had a reasonable opportunity to review this matter or other factors require commission action.” While as a matter of policythe commission generally refrains from commenting publicly on pending investigationswe believe this matter is so crucial to the confidence New Yorkers have in their government that the commission feels it is important to announce that it has renewed its investigation into this whole matter. Let me be clear. The commission is not investigating the events concerning Troopergate; more than enough investigations of the issues surrounding those events have taken or are taking place. Ratherthe commission is investigating the investigations. We are seeking to determine the efficacy of the various investigatory effortsincluding those of the Albany County district attorneythe state inspector general and the State Commission on Public Integrity. Our goal is to report to the people of New York and its government leaders on the effectiveness of those investigations and to propose recommendations for how investigations of high-ranking state officials should take place going forward to ensure that New Yorkers can continue to have confidence in their government and government leaders.

In a phone interviewMr. Lernerwho was previously a presiding judge on the appellate division of State Supreme Courtsaid his commission decided to wait until the release of a report last week by P. David Soaresthe Albany County district attorney.

“We had had a preliminary inquiry under way for some time,” Mr. Lerner said.

Mr. Lerner made it clear that the multipleoverlapping investigations wereat the leastconfusing even to political insiders — not to mention ordinary New Yorkers.

“Many people in the state have felt that the various investigations have been dysfunctionalthat they haven’t proceeded in an orderly fashionto say the least,” he said. “We’re not intending here to be critical of any one particular person or any one particular bodybut we are concerned with the systemic problem that exists. Perhaps when we conclude our inquirywe’ll be able to offer some suggestions to the governor and the Legislature with respect to some systemic prospects.”

The commission was established in 1958 but has its origins in a statewide crime commission established by Gov. Thomas E. Dewey in 1951. “We have a very broad authority to investigate anything of public concern,” Mr. Lerner said.
 727,  2015, a, Season 1Episode 11: ‘Black Friday’

Did anything of substance happen on this week’s episode of “Scream Queens”? Of courseusing the word “substance” in connection with this show is an incongruitybut you know what I mean. We learned that Dean Munschwhom the Chanels tried to kill several timesis apparently immune to puffer fish venom and to being frozen to death in a cryotherapy chamber. We learned that Pete has apparently murdered someone. But did the story move forward much? Did any major characters or even minor ones die? Did the episode have some redeeming valuelike being amusing? No. Maybe this should have been a 10-episode series. (Two more to go.)

The Chanels shook off their discomfort at having found Gigi’s head on their turkey platter last week and headed for the mall for Black Fridaylingering too long and getting locked inside it. The Red Devil soon turned upand the secondary Chanels escapedbut Chanel No. 1 decided to confront Redand she was shot with a crossbow for her troubles. Either Chanellike the deanhas an unkillable quality or there really is a place in the upper body where one can be shot with an arrow yet not bleed even a little. Anywaygood old Denisenow the police chiefshowed up and saved the dayif by saving the day you mean“let the killer get away.”

There was some infighting in the sorority over whether to murder Dean Munsch on the presumption that she is the serial killerand Grace was ultimately tossed out of the group for refusing to stay on board. After the poisoning and freezing fiascoesa third assassination attempt fell apart when the lesser Chanels got distracted by an argument over underwear and failed to turn up at the assigned killing spot.

Then Grace visited Petewho was busy packing to leave town because he’s somehow involved in something shady. She offered him her virginitybut he wasn’t interested. “I can’tbecause I don’t want your first time to be with a murderer,” he told her. Hmm. End of (an uneventful) episode.

 5837,  1984, a, HALF MOON STREET: Two Short

Novels. By Paul Theroux. 219 pages.

Houghton Mifflin. $14.95. Lauren Slaughter is disappointed in London. As the protagonist of ''Doctor Slaughter,'' the longer of the two novellas in Paul Theroux's latest work of fiction''Half Moon Street,'' Lauren finds that London isn't London. ''She had not seen anything here that she had expectedand after a month she had seen too much that she had never expected,'' including the frozen toilet in her Brixton bedsitterwhich a plumber repairs in exchange for Lauren's sexual favors.

Worsedespite her Ph.D.her knowledge of Chinese and her job as a Persian Gulf expert at the Hemisphere Institute of International StudiesLauren is not a success. She is not one of the 5,000 that a man at an Institute dinner party identifies as the real population of the world. ''That's official,'' the man says. ''I am speaking of reality.'' ''Yes,'' says Lauren''in reality there are a billion people in China.'' ''Wrong,'' says the man. ''There are two people in China. I know both of them.''

So Lauren Slaughter takes a second job. After working hours at the Instituteshe becomes an ''escort'' for the Jasmine Agencywhich means that for a fee of a few hundred pounds she provides her ''companionship'' to various men for the evening. It's a long way from CulpeperVa.where Lauren grew up. But at last she seems to have found a way of making it in London.

Gerald DeMarrhero of ''Doctor DeMarr,'' the other novella in ''Half Moon Street,'' hates not Londonnor even his hometown of Bostonwhere his story is setbut rather his twin brotherGeorgewhom he sees as an ''ugly parody'' of himself. So when George shows up after years of silenceasking for ''a place to stay for a while,'' Gerald gives him a week and takes off for his cottage on the Cape.

She was 65.

The cause was “ongoing health issues,” her family said. Ms. Cole had undergone a kidney transplant in 2009 and had suffered from other ailments recentlyforcing the cancellation of tour dates in November and December.

Ms. Cole had a lightsuppleperpetually optimistic voicefull of syncopated turns and airborne swoopsdrawing on both the nuances of jazz singing and the dynamics of gospel. It brought her million-selling albums in the 1970s1980s and 1990s as she moved from the sound of her own generation to that of her parents.

“The biggest similarities between Ms. Cole and her father are in attitude. Instead of working toward catharsisthey aspire to a genteel elegancebalance and good feeling,” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times in 1993. “But where the ultimate direction of the father’s singing was an easy chair on a moonlit porchhis daughter’s tensermore brittle singing evokes an urbanindoor setting. To the decorous phrasing of a big band singer she brings a steady current of soul-music sassiness.”

 3078,  2001, a, Educators who work with immigrant students are cautioning that the New York City Board of Education may have a hard time teaching parents about the choices they have to make now that the bilingual education system is being overhauled.

The parentsseveral educators saidare often intimidated by school bureaucracy and often do not have the time to tend to their children's education.

The Board of Education voted unanimously on Tuesday to give parents of students who speak little English the chance to choose whether their children go into standard bilingual classeswhere most classes are taught in a native languagean English as a second language programwhere English is dominantor two newer optionsa more intensive English as a second language program and a program in which students may be taught in Spanish one day and English the next.

The change came after critics charged that parents did not have control over whether to place their children in bilingual or E.S.L. classes and were often not informed about their choices. About 160,000 of the city's 1.1 million schoolchildren are enrolled in either bilingual or E.S.L. classeswith roughly half the total in each program.

 1604,  2010, a, To call someone a conspiracy theorist isin truthto say something insultingly vaguebecause as we all know conspiracy theorists come in degrees. On the one hand are the elite squad of paranoids who keep 10 years’ worth of kidney beans in their basementsbite their nails and believe that the North Koreans are lacing our club soda with something dangerously nonnutritive. On the other hand are the languorous crackpots who wonder if codes are embedded in their Home Depot receiptsor if George Washington’s wooden leg hid an alternate Constitution. It is for this group that the series “Brad Meltzer’s Decoded” has been conceived.

If you need to ask“Who is Brad Meltzer?,” then “Decoded” (starting Thursday on History) isn’t for you. It is a series for those who already share his affinities for pyramid symbolssecret societiespuzzlesmissing artifactsWashington tombsunderground labyrinthsstealth agendas of the founding fathers and so on. They are interests that Mr. Meltzer has made well known in his best-selling novels: legal thrillers with an archival fetish largely devoid of subtext and meant for consumption between Dulles and O’Hare. These are books for which there are television commercials.

The latest“The Inner Circle,” due next monthis fairly representative of the canon. In it a young government librarian gets into trouble when he shows a pretty girl where the president privately studies classified documents. They accidentally discover a 200-year-old dictionary that lands themas the book jacket denotes“in a web of deceptionconspiracyand murder that will reveal the best-kept secret of the U.S. presidency.”

A dictionary! How quaintly pre-yellowcake! And yet it is this same spirit of irrelevance that animates — ormore accuratelyenervates — Mr. Meltzer’s television venture. Each episode of “Decoded” seeks to unravel some sort of historical mystery in a key that is something close to “Lost” meets a seventh-grade civics lesson. Mr. Meltzerbald and laboring to seem professorialnarrates while standinginexplicablyin front of a chalk board emblazoned with math equations as if he were auditioning for a remake of “A Beautiful Mind” or impersonating Glenn Beck.

MOSCOWSept. 30 (Reuters) - A group of Soviet and British political and military experts called on nuclear powers today to follow the Soviet lead in pledging not to be the first to use nuclear weaponsand recommended that the principle be extended to include conventional arms.

Members of the groupwhich included Field Marshal Lord Carver and Gen. Konstantin Mikhailovsaid at a news conference that both sides felt urgent steps were needed to counter a growing threat of nuclear war.

The group's three-day talks in Moscow were the third in a series of so-called ''Edinburgh conversations'' between Soviet and British experts on the danger of a new war. It was the first such meeting held in the Soviet capital.

 71,  2019, a, Even though it has been a few years since Stephen Colbert stepped out of the blowhard conservative-pundit role that he played for nearly a decade on “The Colbert Report” and into the role ofwellhimselfas host of “The Late Show” on CBSthe 55-year-old’s popularity only continues to grow. His showalready No. 1 in late nighttook over the top spot among viewers ages 18 to 49 earlier this yeara demographic that had long been owned by Jimmy Fallon and “The Tonight Show.” As it turns outwhat Colbert and his show offer — an “explicative deconstruction of the day’s news,” as he puts it — is exactly what many people want. “It’s so confusing today,” said Colbertwho is also an executive producer on Showtime’s animated comedy “Our Cartoon President.” “And that confusion leads to anxietyand the anxiety makes the audience want the jokes.” WhichColbert addedis “the same reason we want to do them.”

“The Late Show” is doing very welland there are obvious explanations you could point to: You’ve had a few years to learn how to do the job. You’re benefiting from a Trump bump. But what’s your own hunch about why the show is resonating? By the spring of 2016we had figured out how I want to do a monologue: We never do setuppunchsetuppunch. Insteadit’s alwaysI’m going to tell back to you what happened today. When the presidential campaign came around in 2016that helped focus us on the things that we most enjoyedwhich is the news of the day. But you say “doing very well,” and I know you mean numerically.1 This is a long preamble to the real answer to your question: It’s almost as if the president is trying to cast a spell to confuse people so they cannot know the true nature of realityand what we do is pick apart the way in which the [expletive] was sold to you. I think that’s why it’s going well. Our job is to identify the [expletive]and there’s never been more.

I remember Jon Stewart2 sayingwhen he was on “The Late Show,” that he was glad he wasn’t digging in the turd mines anymore. Is it ever dispiriting to spend so much time engaging with bad news? The metaphor that I use is that there’s this pool of radioactive sludgewhich is the daily news. My job is to be lowered like carbon rods into that radioactive sludge and absorb the radiation of the insanity that happened today. Then they take me out and put me in front of the cameraand I irradiate it back at the audience at a much lowernonlethal rad level. That’s kind of the job. It’s a transformation of the poison into something entertaining. Do I feel poisoned by doing that? Yeaha little bit. But I get to go do the jokes. I need the audience as much as some of them say they need the show. If the show really works and it feels organicthen the poison’s drained out of me.

The suggestion there is that comedy or satire can relieve people’s tension or anxiety about the world. But as far as I can tellno one is feeling any less tense or anxious. Do you really think the show actually performs a stress-relieving function? Momentarily. You knowmy doctor has informed me that if I could drink less during the weekthat would be good. Because that would be one of the things I would want to do when I go home: have myself an old-fashioned that could stun a buffalo. It’s relaxing at firstbut your blood pressure actually goes up again the next day because you drank four ounces of Maker’s Mark the night before.

If we take that as a metaphorwhere do you fit in it? I’m the alcohol. I might be the alcohol. I don’t know what the next day is like for anybody. If the show goes wellmaybe the audience sleeps a bit better. And maybe that’s all the show should be. I have said this beforebut I know that when you’re laughingyou’re not afraid.

Is that truethough? Isn’t nervous laughter a laughter that comes from fear? Nervous laughter is not the same thing as laughingin my opinion. I would say nervous laughter is evidence that I’m rightbecause that is your body autonomically trying to relieve tension. If someone can do that for you from the outsideit relieves that tension and fearand you are momentarily not afraid. If you’re not afraidyou can thinkand we have to think our way out of this one.

This is bringing a line back to me that you had on election night in 2016in that lovely monologue you gave. You said something like “the devil cannot stand mockery.”3 Right. Exactly.

I’m cynically wondering where the evidence is for that. People were making fun of every tyrant who has ever lived. Nowwait a second. You’re implying that I am saying that satire can affect politics. I will merely paraphrase Peter Cookwho said that the greatest satire of the 20th century were the Weimar cabaretsand they stopped Hitler in his tracks. I have never ever claimed that it has any effect. I have never had any illusion that what I am doing is changing the world. We do it late at nightand maybe you sleep better because of it. As a childcomedy did that for me. I lost my father and two of my brothers when I was a child.4 I was absolutely leveled. But every night I went to sleep listening to George Carlin’s “Class Clown,” “Wonderfulness” by Bill Cosby“Richard Nixon: A Fantasy,” by David Frye. Then later Steve Martin“A Wild and Crazy Guy” and “Let’s Get Small.” Comedy allowed me to go to bed. It gave me a moment of release and happiness. I know that’s true. That’s not the same as saying that you stop tyrants.

Is President Trump good for comedy? How do you come up with a fresh joke about him? I make no claim that we do. Sometimes it’s the same joke. But sometimes there’s still meat left on that chicken. Trump consumes the news cycleand our mandateas we’ve established for ourselvesis that I want to inform the audience of my opinion about what they’ve been thinking about all day. So if the news has been Orange Thanosthen I’m not going to change that. I’m going to do my best to stand in the teeth of that particular [expletive] hurricane and make jokes about how we’re all being lied to. For my own heart’s easeI’m not going to pretend that Trump is not lying to me. The alternative is to stick your head in the sand.

That thing about not wanting to let Trump get away with a lie — is it fair to say that you feel a moral imperative behind your work? Wellwhen you make jokes about politiciansthere’s what they say and what they do. It’s hard to make jokes about someone who says something and then kind of does it. But with a guy who points east with his words and west with his actionthat’s where all the jokes live. Nowwhat are the things he’s lying about? If the things he’s lying about have a moral componentthen your jokes will have a moral component. In other wordsyou don’t choose the flavor. The flavor is chosen by politics itself.

That’s sort of a general answer about the default moral nature of political satire. I was asking more specifically about whether or not you personally feel any sense of moral obligation about your work. No. I meanI have a morality. I suppose it’s related to my Catholicity. I was raised in a devout Catholic home and bottle-fed Robert Bolt’s “A Man for All Seasons,”5 which is about how it’s important that you not let the tide of history sweep you along if you don’t actually agree with it. And William Buckley said he “stands athwart historyyelling stop.”6 I think wewith the showstand athwart history and say: “That’s dumb. What a load of [expletive] that is.” Is that moral? I don’t know. I know that public lies that you are impelled to believe are worse than private ones. But I’m not Erin Brockovich.7 I’m sure as hell not Howard Beale.8 A fair amount of the timeI’m making poop jokes. Matter of factJon Stewartwhen it looked like “The Colbert Report” had come out of the box fully assembled and was going to happenhe said to me“When your children go up to get their diplomas at whatever college they end up going toI want you to whisper to yourself quietly as they get the sheepskin‘I paid for some of this with poop jokes.’”

Going back to “The Colbert Report” — Everything I did working up to Jon StewartI purposely didn’t do anything topical. “Strangers With Candy,”9 we didn’t live in the real world. In some wayssurreal comedy is enjoyable because it relieves you of any moral component. Really stupidsillyabsurd comedy is a wonderful retreat. I used to do this game when I was younger where I would hold up a piece of broccoli. I would look at the piece of broccoli until I could forget which way it was going to drop when I let it go. I would literally hold a piece of broccoli and say: “Forget which way is down. Forget your gravitocentric worldand just let go of that broccoli.” And I knew it had worked if I let it go and the broccoli dropped toward the table and I laughedlike“I didn’t see that coming!” I used to do the same thing where I would go into a bathroom at workand I would lock the door. Then I would try to forget whether or not I had locked the door. If someone came and jiggled the door handle and I was startledI would know I had forgotten. That was a way to unknow the worldso I could see it differently and maybe write more absurd jokes.

When you were doing “The Colbert Report,” there was a huge amount of projection happening on the part of the audience about who you really were and what you really thought.10 Since you’ve switched to “The Late Show” and stopped playing a characterwhat’s been the most interesting or weirdest idea you’ve noticed people projecting onto you? That I want to be a political force. That’s the weirdest thing. I said to Jonback in the day: “You and I are like Frodo and Samwise. We’re trying to throw the damn ring in the volcano. It doesn’t occur to them that we don’t want to use it.” Our way of throwing the ring in the volcano is to make fun of political behavior. But people got mad at me. “Ohnow he’s fashioning himself as a player.” And I’m likeyou could not be more wrong. If you think I want thatyou know nothing about me. I just want to make jokes. I care about what happens in the news. I have an audience that seems to caretoo. We mesh on the jokes. It’s not complicated.

How many times have you read “The Lord of the Rings?” I lost count at 50. I am in the middle of a 180-hour lecture series by Corey Olsenthe Tolkien professorwho goes through it page by page. Almost every night I listen to about 15 minutes of a lecture.

What is it about those books for you? There are very few fictional works with that depth and background. Those first stories — Eärendil the Mariner — those attempts to create a national epic like the Finns have the Kalevala;11 England did not have thatso that’s Tolkien’s magnum opusand he was still working on that in 1973 when he died. This attempt that he had to create a gesamtkunstwerk. It’s a complete work. A total work of art.

But what do you get from “The Lord of the Rings” emotionally? Loss.

What about loss? Tolkien makes loss beautiful. He has a medievalist view of the world: The world is in a constant state of diminishment. The elves originally create the rings to stop the diminishment of the worldto maintain the beauty of the moment of creation that they came into. And the great revelationwhich comes from Tolkien’s elvesis that men are incredibly ambitious and build high towers because they know they’re going to be gone. The elves are laid-back because they’re going to be around foreverand so they don’t have great ambition. Their great continuing sadness is that they see the diminishment of the world. That sadness isI thinka big part of Catholicism. Because God himself diesand God himself has agony andof courseoriginal sin.

Did the books help you make sense of your own loss? Sureof course. Nobody gets out unscathed. Frodohe’s the herobut he has to go to Valinor to be healed of his woundsand Gandalf saysI will not say: do not cryfor not all tears are an evil. And Galadrielwhen she doesn’t take the ring — what’s beautiful about that is that she says: “I pass the test. I will diminish and go into the West and remain Galadriel.” The heroic thing to do is to accept your diminishmentto accept — in the human’s case — death. In Tolkien’s worlddeath is the gift of Ilúvatarwho’s the one God. Catholicism is deeply combed through all these things. To perceive the world in the light of eternityto accept your death as a giftto accept suffering as a path toward joy. All of those are in Christ on the cross. So I think the books are another way for me to perceive the reality that my faith is trying to reveal to me through its tradition.

I want to ask you what’s probably a naïve question about faith. But I promise that it’s sincereand it’s about something I’m hoping you can help me with. I know that faith is a subject that often gets raised in interviews with you. It does get raised a lotbecause it first got raisedand then it self-perpetuates. I guess not a lot of people in my business are comfortable talking about it. But it means a lot to meand it was a big part of my identity growing up.

You’ve said something to the effect that “The Late Show” can help to remind people that there is rationalobjective reality and that a politician can’t just say “this is what’s real” and expect to have people believe it. I don’t know whether I have ever said that.12 You’re phrasing that in an interesting way that has a different meaning than I intendedbut finish your questionand I’ll see where you’re going with that.

Thank you. So this is related to the idea of how belief in nationalism is ultimately about the feeling and comfort that idea gives people and maybe not so much about objective factswhich is to say it’s about a kind of faith. Butand I think this is part of what I’ve always stumbled over with religionwhy is it that we might accept a form of belief that perhaps doesn’t jibe with objective reality as being fundamentally problematic and socially detrimental while another one — religious belief — we’re supposed to understand as O.K.? Can parallels be drawn there? That’s interesting. That’s a really big question. I think you’re describing two different things. Everyone approaches their own faith in their own way. So you might be describing an exact parallel between someone’s faith and our present political moment. There might be no difference to some people. To methere’s a difference because in the red meat that gets thrown out in many political ralliesnot just this president’syou’re indulging the audience’s appetite. That’s not the same thing as appealing to their principles. To indulge the audience’s appetite is what my old character on “The Colbert Report” used to do. That was indulging a whiteChristianstraight male American hegemonic self-imageand that’s not the same thing as faith. Faith is an acceptance of reality for meand it is an attempt to humbly perceive what your role isand my faithas anemic as it isreminds me of values of fellowshiplovehumility. Those are all things that I might have in common with people at anyone’s red-meat-slinging rallybut when the meat is offered at those ralliesmaybe the principles aren’t as important as the meat. Faith is different. Faith is not trying to change the world. Faith is not trying to change God. Faith isn’t trying to change the order of things. Faith isn’t trying to maintain your position. Faith isn’t trying to make less of the other. Faith is asking God to change you. You are the subject of God’s loveand in accepting thatyou can transform yourself and release yourself of these appetites that are almost always at someone else’s expense. That’s how they’re different to me. But you asked because you were wondering whether I could give that to you? Because I can’t.

Nono. I just thought you would help me by having a thoughtful answer to my confused question. Which you did. I’m O.K. talking about my faithbut I work very hard not to proselytize. I would never want anybody to think I was trying to convince them of my point of view. Becauseheymore Jesus for me.

The other day your monologue was about the de facto Alabama abortion ban. YeahI had avoided making jokes about itbecause you can’t win making jokes about abortion. Half of the people are just going to be mad at you. But Alabama was an unavoidable one. The reason we did it was because that was aboutI thoughta very cynicalpurposeful overreach. Even the people who were writing the law said they don’t want that law.

Because it’s about getting the law kicked up to the Supreme Court? Right. But I don’t understand why the governor would sign that law. That seemed like a real misuse of legislation. Write the law you wantand then see whether the Supreme Court supports you. Don’t write the law you don’t want just so it will go to the Supreme Court. The whole thing seems so contemptible to me. But that had such a larger political perspective to it that it seemed as though not talking about it would have been an odd breaking of my own rule: We talk about what people are talking about.

Your monologue did make me wonder where you stand on the legal right to an abortion. I doubt I’ll ever need to get one.

Wellcan I askthenif you support a woman’s legal right to an abortion? I support a woman’s legal right to exert all her rights. One of her rightspresentlyis to have an abortion. I am not in favor of the judges who have been appointed who might likely overturn that. I respect the women I know and their opinion on the subject. I believe that abortion is a woman’s choice. I also know and love many people who feel differently.

Thank you for addressing that. I know it’s a complicated subject. It’s not really a difficult subject for me in terms of its political reality. It’s a difficult subject for me because of its comedy. It is a march through a desert comedicallyand I do not mistake myself for a political figure. I’m a comedianand so my reticence has nothing to do with my politics.

So to return to the idea that people incorrectly might think that you want to be a political player. Which is understandablebecause a reality star is president.

Do you consider the balance of whom you’re making jokes about? Sure. That’s going to be helped now because there are Democrats to talk about. When Joe Biden got heat for sniffing women’s headswe did an act that he was doing A.S.M.R. We make jokes about Beto O’Rourke. We make jokes about Elizabeth Warren. We make jokes about Andrew Yang. We make jokes about Pete Buttigieg. What I’m happy about is that my audience is laughing at all of themwhich is good. But not everybody is as mockable as everybody elseand some mockability doesn’t have consequences. Nowmaybe Andrew Yang will be president — I don’t know [expletive] about politics; I only know about human behavior — but his running on no circumcisionfree money and legalized pot13 is of no consequence compared with Donald Trump. So in terms of balanceI don’t really care. I care about being honest about what people talked about today.

In what ways do you know about human behavior? I was trained as an actorand there’s a philosophical introspective aspect of acting. Because of that trainingI approach political satire not through politics but: Why is that person behaving that way? What are the insecurities inside the president? Why does he need to lie? That’s not about politics. I deconstruct human behavior and think,What’s funny about that?

Can you apply that same actorly psychological analysis to yourself? What’s funny about your own behavior? If I’m enjoying a meeting I’m having with someoneI interrupt them constantly. If I’m bored by the meetingI look like I’m very attentive. I am late for everything. I can relate anything you say back to something from the legendarium of J.R.R. Tolkien or his lettersto a fault. I can usually summon up a little bit of poetry that has something to do with what we’ve just talked about. All of these show that my mind is something of a squirrel cage. I scramble all over the place. Having a conversation with me is like having a conversation with three different people at the same time. OhI also cry easily.

As far as the larger conversation we’re all havingdo you think there’s a way in whichintentionally or notyour show functions as part of the political punditsphere we seem to be mired inwhere it feels as if we’re all mad at one another all the time? You’re describing a divisive atmosphereand when you say “function,” I think you mean“Does it feed that?”

Yes. It might. The behavior I’m exhibiting fits my genrewhich is not supposed to have respectability. There’s a reason it’s not a central part of polite society. But there’s supposed to be a polite society out there! It’s not my fault there isn’t one anymore. I feel completely secure encouraging laughter at the behavior of people who I think are doing a terrible job and claiming that they’re doing it all for our benefit or being mendacious. So am I part of the problem? That is not for me to say. I just think I’m doing my job.

 535,  2016, a, Staked to a 3-0 lead before he stepped on the moundJake Arrieta started things off by striking out Carlos Santana on just four pitches. He retired Jason Kipnis on a grounder to second basebut then walked Francisco Lindor on seven pitches. He recovered to strike out Mike Napoli to end the inning. Arrieta appeared fired upbut while the broadcast crew talked about his pitches reaching 97 m.p.h. (perhaps based on radar guns used by television stations that often get much higher readings than the ones used by scouts)M.L.B.’s Pitch F/X data had him throwing only one pitch as fast as 95with most of his fastballs being 92 or 93.

David Waldstein: The Indians brought in 95-year-old Eddie Robinsonthe last surviving member of the 1948 Indians championship team. Robinson played first base and knocked in the winning run in Game 6 of that Series. He was asked if he ever thinks about how much Bob Feller and Bob Lemonwho started Game 6would earn if they pitched today.

“I think about Eddie Robinson and what he could have gotten,” he replied.

Top of 2nd: Tomlin Settles Down

Jason Heyward jumped on the first pitch he saw and hit a flyball to right that fell into Lonnie Chisenhall’s glove. Javier Baez hit a grounder up the middle that Jason Kipnis came across second base to field before throwing across his body to get the out at first. Dexter Fowler then hit a soft popup to Chisenehall to end the half-inning.

David Waldstein: The average velocity of balls coming off the bat against Tomlin (known as exit velocity to seamheads) was about 90 miles per hour for much of the seasonbut in the postseason it was down to 82 m.p.h. as Tomlin’s curveball improved. That differential looked like it was played out between the first and second innings.

Bottom of 2nd: Arrieta Cruises Through Indians’ Lineup

Jake Arrieta absolutely steamrolled the Indians in the second inning. He struck out Jose Ramirez and Lonnie Chisenhall before getting Coco Crisp to ground out to third for the third out.

David Waldstein: Arrieta looks sharpbut bear in mind he was staked to a three-run lead in a division series start against the Giantsand the Cubs lost that game. There are an extraordinary number of Cubs fans here at Progressive Fieldand they are in full voice early.

 3304,  2000, a, ''A brilliant thesis drawn from insight into the future,'' said the party's official paperPeople's Dailyon May 22 in a typical description. ''A concentrated embodiment of the fundamental nature of the party and the essence of socialism.''

In other newspapersofficials have called Mr. Jiang's prosaic statement ''pregnant with connotations and meanings,'' ''a scientific summation of our party's nearly 80 years of historical importance'' and ''a great program for party-building in the new century.''

The Liberation Army Daily hailed it as ''an essential compass for militaryideological and political construction in the new era,'' while the Federation of Trade Unionsnot to be outdonesaid Mr. Jiang ''answers the question of why and how the working class is relied on the during the process of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.'' The China Women's News proclaimed''The 'Three Represents' are the criteria for women's work.''

The campaign isof courselow-key compared with the vicious political winds of the Mao eraand much of the population today can simply tune it out. At the popular Xinhua Bookstore in central Beijing todaymost customers walked right past the rack up front that featured the booklet on Mr. Jiang's speeches.

But the booklet is a best seller at the Party Documents Bookstorewhere officials are buying it in bulk for their colleaguesand ambitious party and government leaders can hardly afford to ignore the new catch phrases.

''Quite apart from substancethe campaign is a test of whether subordinates and local leaders in the provinces are staying in step,'' the editor said. ''That's why in recent days we've seen one local leader after another coming forward -- it's a way to affirm their allegiance and keep their jobs.''

This new campaign went into overdrive even before last year's ''Three Stresses'' campaign (theoretical studypolitical awareness and good conduct) had fully run its coursecausing complaints about the sheer waste of time and energy.

 528,  2016, a, The estate of the author Maurice Sendak has emerged mostly victorious in a legal battle with the Rosenbach Museum and Library in Philadelphiawhich had been the repository of thousands of his original drawings and parts of his book collection before his death in 2012. In a ruling in Connecticut probate courta judge awarded the bulk of the disputed book collection to the Sendak estatenot to the museum.

Some items had been on loan to the Rosenbach for decadesand many in the museum world expected that the Sendak material would remain there. But Mr. Sendak’s will specified that the drawings and most of the loans would remain the property of the Maurice Sendak Foundation. In 2014representatives of his estate withdrew the workssaying they intended to follow Mr. Sendak’s directive in his will to create “a museum or similar facility” in RidgefieldConn.where he livedand where his foundation is based“to be used by scholarsstudentsartistsillustrators and writersand to be opened to the general public” as the foundation’s directors saw fit.

The Rosenbach filed an action in 2014 in state probate court in Connecticutcontending that the estate had kept many rare books that Mr. Sendak had pledged to the library in his willincluding two highly valuable illuminated books by William Blake and a selection of rare Beatrix Potter books.

The judge in the caseJoseph A. Egan Jr.ruled on Oct. 25 that the Blake illuminated workswhich could be worth millions of dollarsdo not fit Mr. Sendak’s specific language in his will that the museum should receive “rare edition books.” The estate had argued that the Blake pieces were not edition books as such but were more akin to unique works.

Players have fond memories of that excursion last year and say it helped unite them. The field trip also helped the image of Girardiwho was perceived as uptight during his first season as the Yankees’ manager.

Planning another outing was one of the first things Girardi talked about this spring. The only question was where the team would go. Citing injury riskGirardi rejected paintball and bowling as suggestions.

Phil Hughes suggested a pool party. “Water slides,” he said.

Dave Robertson said that if he were in chargehe would take everyone fishing. Then he heard Hughes’s suggestion.

“That’s even better,” Robertson said. “A pool party barbecue.”

Robertson volunteered to grill. Hamburgers and chicken are his specialtyhe said.

After Monday’s workouttwo new possibilities were broached with Girardi.

How about Ping-Pong?

“You worry about guys overswinging,” Girardi said.

A Scrabble tournament?

“Now that would be interesting,” he said.

Introduced last Thursday: 2011 Kia Optima sedan

Is it real? Yes. Take off the badges and you could mistake the 2011 Kia Optima for a European luxury car.

What they said: Kia should mean more than bargain-prices and a strong warrantyaccording to Peter SchreyerKia’s chief design officer. Speaking directly after the press conferenceMr. Schreyer said the Optima can make Kia a “desirable brand,” while maintaining core values such as affordability and economy.

What they didn’t say: How will Kia stop the stylish new Optima from cannibalizing sales of sister company Hyundai? The Optima shares the same platform and engines as the Hyundai Sonatawhich received a similar revamp earlier this year. Toyota and Honda might be the intended targetsbut the Korean brands could equally end up stealing sales from each other.

What makes it tick? Three engines are available: a naturally aspirated 2.4-liter 4-cylindera 2-liter turbocharged 4 andin early 2011a hybrid based on the 2.4-liter engine. A 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic with paddle shifters are the transmission choices. The fanciest options – like a panoramic sunroofspecial black leather trimand the gorgeous 18-inch alloys seen on the show car at the New York Auto Show – come standard on the sportiest trim levelthe Optima SX.

How much? How soon? The Optimain naturally-aspirated 2.4-liter and 2-liter turbocharged formatarrives this fall. Howeverthe wait for the Optima hybrid stretches into early next year. Pricing (and official m.p.g. figures) will be revealed closer to the launch date.

How does it look? This is one great looking carplain and simple. Other journalists at the New York auto show compared the exterior to cars from the likes of Saab and Audi.

As my colleagues Anahad O’Connor and Robbie Brown reported earlierHurricane Earl weakened to a Category 3 storm early Wednesday with winds of 125 miles per hourbut evacuations have begun along the Atlantic coast ahead of the powerful storm’s expected impact later this week.

A spokesman for the National Hurricane Center told The Associated Press that a storm this powerful has not threatened such a large area of the East Coast since Hurricane Bob in 1991.

At 8 a.m. on Wednesday the National Hurricane Center in Miami issued its latest advisory on Hurricane Earlwith this updated forecast of the path it could follow in the days ahead:

According to the centera hurricane watch is in effect for North Carolina and Virginia from north of Surf CityN.C. to Parramore IslandVa. including the Pamlico and Albermarle Sounds. A tropical storm watch is in effect for the North Carolina coast from Cape Fear to Surf City. In additiona tropical storm warning is in effect for San Salvador Island in the central Bahamas.

Even if the storm does not make landfall it is powerful enough to cause damage on shorewith destructive winds and currents.

The A.P. reports that tourists in North Carolina are lining up to leave Ocracoke Island on the state’s Outer Banksas forecasters said the storm appears likely to approach Cape Hatteras on Thursday.

A new video report from the news agency notes that the hurricane is currently projected to deal a glancing blow to the northeastern United Statesperhaps hitting Cape CodMass.and the Maine shoreline on Friday night and Saturday.

On Wednesday morning the National Hurricane Center also issued a new advisory on Tropical Storm Fionawhich is intensifying as it approaches the northern Leeward islands. The center issued warnings to several islands in the Caribbean in Fiona’s path and provided this image with its latest Tropical Weather Outlook advisory for the Atlantic Oceanshowing the current location of the two storms and a possible new one forming behind them:

 5287,  1988, a, An Indian judge has issued an injunction temporarily barring the Union Carbide Corporation from making any out-of-court settlement with individual victims of the Bhopal gas leak.

The temporary injunctionissued Wednesday by Judge Mahadeo Wamman Deo in Bhopalwas sought by India's Government to block the American company's efforts to bypass the Government in settling claims growing out of the 1984 disaster. Judge Deo said court proceedings would begin July 29 to determine whether the injunction should be made permanent.

His rulinglegal experts said todaymeans that the Bhopal case is again caught up in a procedural battle having little to do with the accident.

Officials of Union Carbideat its headquarters in DanburyConn.and in Indiadid not respond to requests for comment on Judge Deo's ruling.
 1696,  2009, a, Chevrolet-Saturn of Harlem became the first affiliate of General Motors to seek Chapter 11 protection as the carmaker prepares for a massive government-sponsored restructuring.

The dealershipwhich Reuters noted is owned by G.M.a rarityfiled for bankruptcy in federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan. While G.M. has not yet filed — it is expected to do so around 8 a.m. — the company described G.M. as a “debtor-in-possession under Chapter 11.” (Read the filing after the jump.)

Chevrolet-Saturn of Harlem listed more than $1 billion in liabilities. It is seeking to retain a slew of advisers who are also representing G.M.including the law firm WeilGotshal & Manges and the investment banks Evercore Partners and the Blackstone Group.

Its largest creditors were listed as the Wilmington Trust Companyrepresenting holders of nearly $22.8 billion of bond debtand affiliates of the United Automobile Workers unionrepresenting nearly $20.6 billion in employee obligations.

Reuters noted that according to federal bankruptcy rulescompanies have one of three criteria to fulfill to file a Chapter 11 case in a particular district. G.M. is incorporated in Delawareand its principal place of business is in Michigan. So in order to avail itself of the New York court systemit needed an affiliate that had already filed for bankruptcy in that district.

 5672,  1985, a, Difficulties for Young Pupils

The newsletter found evidence that mathematics homework creates ''substantial difficulties'' for younger children. ''When the Philadelphia public schools set up a homework hot line for confused children and their parentsthey were deluged with telephone calls - and elementary math led the list of troubles,'' it said.

''Elementary schools surely need the regular experience of puzzling alone over math problems,'' it continued. ''But perhaps they ought to do most of this at schools so that they can get informed help when they need it. One study shows that even eighth graders can learn as much from short assignments completed in the classroom as from longer problem sets taken home.''

A major benefit of homeworkthe newsletter foundis that it leads to communication between parents and the school. ''With students below the high school yearshomework involves more than just a childa book and a pencil,'' it said. ''Whole households participate in one way or another.''

One study of 26 blue-collar parents by Jean Chandler and Catherine Snow of Harvard found that the parents assisted their children in ''appropriate'' waysproviding encouragement and help that the childrenwho were interviewed separatelydescribed as helpful.

''Homework gave these parents a window on their children's schoolwork and sometimes led them to talk to the teacher,'' said the researchersadding that such contacts may have improved the children's chances for success at school because ''teachers expected more of boys and girls whose parents sought them out.''

Student Attitudes Vary Widely

Not surprisinglyresearch on homework suggests that attitudes of students toward different types of homework vary widely. A study of Australian schools by Frank Coulter found that students completed more of their assignments when teachers made it central to the work of the coursecollected it routinelyspent time reviewing it in class and wrote it down rather than announced it orally at the end of class.

The researcher also found that high school students were greatly influenced by whether they regarded the homework as useful and interesting. Social studies assignmentsfor exampletend to be completed more regularly than those in English.

Many of the visitors waved their hats at West and East German guards alikeand shouted New Year's wishes.

Crowds of East Berliners awaiting their relatives thronged the streets on the other side. The East Berliners appear even more gratified than the Westerners over the holiday pass arrangement.

 5668,  1985, a, The camera work of both the Summer and Winter Olympics was invariably beautiful or exciting or dramaticand sometimes all threefrom the kaleidoscopic multitude of oars flashing in the rowing races to Gabriela Andersen-Schiess's staggering into the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on the last leg of the women's marathon.

From the broadcasting boothsABC sought at first to make the Summer Olympics not just a great sports carnival but an American sports triumph (something it couldn't do in Sarajevobecause the United States squad was not dominant). The network figured that this would sellbut the blatant cheerleading and the unprofessionalism antagonized manyeven a good number of naturally partisan Americans.

Juan Antonio Samaranchpresident of the International Olympic Committeesent a letter of formal complaint about ABC's coverage to the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee and its headPeter Ueberroth. NextRoone Arledgedirecting the network's Olympic coveragewas apprised of itand he reacted. The brassy boosterism was toned downand with no discernible drop in viewing pleasure.

And whatit followedis the appropriate role of the commentator on a televised sports event? Wellhe should bring to the microphone a sense of showmanshipcertainlybut also a sense of journalistic proprietyof maintaining perspective.

Above allwe ask that our intelligence not be insulted. We want to be given captions to what we're seeing. Much of the story is unfolding before our eyesand so we need not be told too much. And the announcerno matter who he isis not the show. We tune in for the event and not the commentatora point of which some commentators are not aware. The caption notion was true during the Olympicsa special eventand it is true on regular sports shows.

In the ratings two weeks agofor examplethe

final ''Monday Night Football'' broadcast of the

season was the second-ranked show of the weekbehind only ''Dynasty.'' The game matched two attractive teams - the Dolphins and the Cowboys - and was of great interest to fans following the National Football League's playoff possibilities.

In the last few monthsthere has been some scratching of heads about the diminishing ratings of pro football on television - and of ''Monday Night Football'' in particularespecially since Howard Cosellwho had been in the booth since the program began in 1970had taken his leave. A question was raised: Is ''Monday Night Football'' fading because Cosell is gone?

Answeraccording to the recent ratings: No.

Provide a game of interestand the fans will tune in.

The sports event as dramawhether it be a football game or an Olympic raceremains the story.

El jueves de la semana pasadatras una mañana ajetreada en la que habló ante el Congreso de Estados Unidos y compartió con indigentes en un almuerzo al aire libreel Papa Francisco se retiró a la Embajada del Vaticano en Washingtoncustodiada por estrictas medidas de seguridad. Según los funcionarios del Vaticanoel papa tomaría una “breve siesta” antes de volar a Nueva York para la segunda etapa de su viaje por Estados Unidos.

Pero el papade 78 añosno solo tomó una siesta esa tarde. También tuvo tiempo para una reunión privada con Kim Davisuna secretaria de un condado de Kentucky considerada un héroe por los conservadores religiosos porque prefirió ir a la cárcel antes que emitir licencias de matrimonio a parejas del mismo sexo.

Ni una sola palabra se filtró sobre el encuentro de Francisco con Davis; nisiquiera cuando un reportero de televisión estadounidense le preguntó al papa durante la conferencia de prensa en el vuelo hacia Roma cuál era su opinión sobre los funcionarios públicos que se niegan a cumplir su trabajo por objeciones religiosas al matrimonio entre personas del mismo sexo. Esta pregunta fue una clara referencia a Davispero ni el reportero ni el papa mencionaron su nombre.

“La objeción de conciencia es un derecho que es parte de cada derecho humano”respondió Franciscoaunque añadió que no podía hablar sobre casos específicos.

Seis días después del encuentro furtivo con Davis en la embajadael míercoles pasado un vocero del Vaticano confirmó que la reunión había ocurridopero no ofreció mayores detalles.

Por casi ocho horasfuncionarios del Vaticano se negaron a confirmar o negar la reunión; pero finalmente lo confirmaron en la tarde del miércoles.

Alternativelyprint out the following list of some of the artists mentioned in the articlecut names into strips and fold overand allow pairs to blindly pick a strip of paper.

Roberto Matta

Arshile Gorky

Jackson Pollock

Mark Rothko

Robert Motherwell

Pavel Tchelitchew

Ivan Albright

Vera Berdich

Charles Howard

Joseph Cornell

Isamu Noguchi

Marcel Duchamp

Salvador Dali

Joan Miro

De Chirico

Helen Lundberg

Kurt Seligmann

Charles Seliger

Federico Castellon

Charles Rain

Yves Tanguy

André Masson

Max Ernst

Explain to students that their task is to locate and research one piece of art created by their artist using accessible resources. Based on this piecepairs will answerto the best of their abilitythe following questions:

-What are some important biographical facts about the artist?

-What is the title of your selected piece of art? What does the title suggest about its meaning?

-When was the artwork created? What were some important events or considerations during this period of time that may have influenced the artist?

-In what medium was the piece of art created?

-What do you think the piece of art “means” or “symbolizes”?

-What do art critics or other art consumers think about the meaning of this piece of work?

-What makes the piece of art “surrealistic”?

Students should take notes as they gather information about their particular piece of artwork and then use it to write the text of an audio guide designed for young adults. The recording should run no longer than 2-3 minutes. If possiblestudents may record their text.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Once pairs have finished writing and/or recording their textstudents should display their selected pieces of artwork (as printed images) in the style of a museum gallery and read (or play from a recording) their text aloud. If equipment is availablestudents may even walk around with handheld tape players or other audio players to simulate the audio guide experience. The class should then verbally summarize and discuss overall impressions of the Surrealism art movementin light of their research and discoveries.

Further Questions for Discussion:

-What makes someone an “artist”? Can anyone and everyone be an “artist”?

-What is the origin of the word “art”?

-Should art be taught in all schools? Why or why not?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on initial journal responsesthoughtful participation in class discussionscooperation in small groupsand creativity and accuracy in writing the text of an audio guide about a particular artist’s work.

Extension Activities:

1. What genres of art are you particularly attracted toand why? Browse art books to see what categories of art appeal to your interests. Then design a PowerPoint presentation that describes particular pieces from this genre and what aspects about it are interesting to you.

2. Select a subject that is taught in kindergartensuch as the alphabet or countingand design a children’s book that speaks to this subject. For examplehow would you use a Surrealist painting in an alphabet book that engages young children? Try out your book in an elementary school classif possible.

3. Produce an illustrated timeline of the Surrealism movement that chronologically and visually portrays the development of the art work in this style through the years. Provide captions to elucidate main points of emphasis.

4. Select one of the artists mentioned in the article and write a brief and engaging biography of his or her life. Alternativelywrite a letter to one of the artists mentioned in the article. What questions might you have for him or her? What comments might you like for him or her to hear?

5. Visit a local art museum. Write a guide for teens and other young people describing ways to enjoy the art. How would you suggest for a young person to walk through an exhibit? What would you suggest that a teen might consider when looking at an artwork?

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Economics – One of the reasons that not all the desired pieces of art were available for the exhibit is that “loans fell through.” Visit a local museum or gallery and interview a curator. Inquire about the business aspects of designing and commissioning an exhibit. What are all the financial considerations involved in this productionsuch as artist feeslicensing costsinsuranceetc.? Design a pie chartbased on your interviewthat indicates the budget of a typical museum exhibit.

Media Studies – View a biographical movie about an artistsuch as “Pollack” (2000)“Basquiat” (1996)or “Frida” (2002). Based on these filmsrespond to the following questions in a film review: What is the image of an “artist”? How do the films capture this personal development? What aspects of the artists’ lives make them “tormented” or “starving” artistsif at all?

Teaching with The Times – Over the next few weeksclip articles about new exhibits or productions described in the New York Times Arts section. Using your clippingswrite a social commentary about the types of art that are currently being presented to the general public. Why do you think these current shows or exhibits speak to the contemporary art consumer? Does an exhibit always need to have a popular following to be a success? How do the current times influence the types of art we may be interested in viewing? To order The New York Times for your classroomclick here.

 2452,  2005, a, IT is something of a Fashion Week tradition to gauge which newcomer will generate the most buzzwhich up-and-coming designer will whet the appetite of retailers with the presentation of mere sketches. For the New York showswhich begin Sept. 8a leading contender is Brian Reyesa designer who held jobs for Ralph LaurenMichael Kors and Oscar de la Renta before branching out on his own at the age of 24.

The pattern of previous designers who became prominent in American fashion within a matter of seasons -- people like Zac PosenDerek Lamand Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez of Proenza Schouler -- was certainly on Mr. Reyes's mind when he decided to create his own collection for spring 2006. But Mr. Reyes has a history of precocious behavior.

As a teenager in Fort LauderdaleFla.he befriended several stylists and assisted them on fashion shoots in Miami. By 19 he had saved enough money working at a Coach store to move to New Yorkhaving persuaded the company to let him work at its Madison Avenue location. After less than a month in the city he got his first design job at Polo Ralph Laurenwhere he made clothes for boys.

"They only found out later I was 19," said Mr. Reyeswho went on to become the men's collection designer for Mr. Kors in 2001 and joined Mr. de la Renta's design studio in 2004.
 3818,  1997, a, ''We got interested in the family because a number of the factors in it showed enormous promise in terms of clinical applications,'' Dr. Lee said.

The family is known as transforming growth factor-beta genes. Members that Dr. Lee cited as examples included bone morphogenetic proteinswhich are being tested in people as an aid to fracture healingand a substance known as a neurotrophic factor that may prove to have a role in treating Parkinson's disease and Lou Gehrig's disease.

Dr. Lee said the most immediate application of the myostatin findings might be to agriculture. Chickenscows and pigs all have the geneand he said that if it works in them as it does in miceknockouts might produce twice as much meat with no more fat.

Humans also have the geneand Dr. Lee said he hoped the research might ultimately lead to new treatments for diseases like muscular dystrophy and for the severe muscle wasting that causes disability and premature death in some people with cancer and AIDS.

''But that's a long way off,'' he added''years away.''

One concern is that turning off the myostatin gene might cause cancer. Other genes in its family are tumor suppressorsand when they are removed or blockedthe animals die of cancer. The new mice are being watched for thisDr. Lee said.

So farwith some of the animals over a year old -- about half the life span of a mouse -- no tumors have been found. Except for their big musclesthe mice appear physically normalthe researchers said.

But they do behave differently from ordinary mice. Ms. McPherronwho was bitten by one of the animals at the news conference announcing their debutnonetheless described them as gentler than normal miceand ''a little sluggish.''

 4269,  1994, a, Yet with half the season remainingthe Knicks have the same record as Houston and they are just one game behind Seattle. And the SuperSonics have a lot to think about after being manhandled on their home floor Saturday by the Knicks106-92.

Last seasonthe Knicks were only 26-15 through 41 gamesbefore rolling to a 34-7 record in the second half of the season. One of New York's goals this season is to finish with the National Basketball Association's best record. The Knicks face the most difficult part of their schedule during the next five weeksbut by winning 10 of their last 12 gamesthey appear poised for a strong second half.

"YesI'm pleased with where we are," said Coach Pat Riley. "At one time this seasonwe only had six players healthy enough to practice. We've managed to keep our heads above water. There's every reason to believe that our best basketball is ahead of us." Harper Fitting In

Several signs indicate that Riley may be correct. Anthony Masonplagued by nagging injuries all seasonfinished the West Coast trip with two strong games. Smith has been more assertive since returning six games ago. Not only has Smith attacked the basket aggressivelybut he has added a 3-point jumper to his arsenal. His offensive ability and 6-foot-10-inch size force most teams to double-team himwhich creates openings for other players.

Derek Harper has begun to feel comfortable in the Knicks' offense. He went through the same process that most players who are traded go through. He hesitated to shoot and he was tentative because he was not familiar with the offense. But on SundayHarper played his best game since being traded to the Knicks by the Mavericks on Jan. 6. Harper scored 22 points on 7-for-10 shootinggiving New York a new outside threat at the point-guard position. Riley said he hoped to create more options in the offense for Harper as the coach became more familiar with Harper's game.

For more than three weeks there has been a notable absence of the attacks in the Government‐controlled radio and press.

Editorial assaults and Government‐sponsored demonstrations reached a peak in January and early February with the expulsion on charges of subversion of four Americanswho were visiting professors at the University of Ghana.

The State Department strongly protested and recalled Ambassador William P. Mahoney Jr. to Washington for “urgent consultations.”

 5888,  1983, a, TRENTON THE first year of the Kean administrationa period marked by economic problems and partisan bickeringhas ended. Prospects for continued turmoil in the State House during the coming legislative election year also appear greatfor every major bill will be debated with an eye toward its effect on the re-election chances of the 120 members of the Senate and Assembly.

Last year began with calls for bi-partisan cooperation by Governor Keanwho won election by the smallest margin in state historyand by the Democratic leaders in the Senate and Assembly. Mr. Keana Republicanwas the first incoming Governor in recent history to win election without also pulling in majorities of his own party in both houses of the Legislature.

This proved costlyas problems caused by the ailing national economy escalated routine partisan posturing into confrontation. Before the year endedMr. Kean had repeatedly called the legislative leadership ''irresponsible'' for failing to enact new taxes to support state budget needs. At the same timeboth the Senate PresidentCarmen A. OrechioDemocrat of Nutleyand the Assembly SpeakerAlan J. KarcherDemocrat of Sayrevillepictured the Governor as ''timid'' and lacking the leadership to find a solution to the budget crisis.

Relations between the two branches of government were strained during the first six months by the necessity of trimming more than $200 million from spending requests before enacting the current fiscal-year budget of $6.2 billiona record high.

SATURDAY PUZZLE — When last we saw Erin Rhodeshe was making her debut almost exactly one year agowith a wonderfully fun and lively Friday puzzle.

Ms. Rhode returns today and it makes me insanely happy to see a woman contributing strong themeless puzzles to the queue. Welcome backMs. Rhode.

I love the fact that the colloquialism I CAN’T EVEN makes its debut todayright beside PASS A TESTwhich is hilarious if you read them together. In additionFOOD COMAAND I’M OUTRED VINES and REPAYABLE make their debuts.

Tricky Clues

– 1A: For some reasonI conflated “postprandial” with “drunk out of one’s head,” and wrote in HANGOVER for the clue “Postprandial woe.” Just goes to show you. Postprandial means after one has eatenand the answer is the very lively FOOD COMA.

– 43A: ENA was Bambi’s aunt in the Disney film.

– 49A: I love oyster crackerseven without the chowderbut that’s not what the clue was going for today. With the question mark at the end of the cluewe need to rethink the meaning of the word “crackers.” You know who cracks and eats oysters? OTTERS. Clever animalsthose OTTERS. They open them with a rock. In facthere’s one eating a clam:

– 64A: There are so many ways to show one’s feelings. You could send flowerswrite a nice note. But if you’re going to display a small show of feelingswhich is the key phrase hereyou might use an EMOTICON.

– 5D: Roman numerals in puzzles. Devilishespecially when it’s clued vaguelylike “10th-century year.” So how do you solve it? Take heart in the fact that you already know that the first Roman numeral is going to be C because of the clue. Then solve 15- and 16A to get CMIor 901.

– 11D: SAT flashback time! A pride is a group of lions and you are being asked for the collective name for toads. Pride : lions :: KNOT : toads.

– 35D: The clue “Old dope?” is not looking for the village idiot. The “old” in today’s cluewhich is very clevermeans that you are being asked for an old form of the word “dope.” Back in the daypeople used the word RAD (short for “radical!”) to mean “dope.”

– 41D: When you’re working “blue,” you’re working with racy or dirty material. A “blue book” in today’s puzzle is not a test bookletbut SMUT.

Let’s hear all about the puzzle from Ms. Rhode herself:

Constructor’s Notes

I’m very excited to show off my second-ever New York Times crossword puzzlejust over one year from my first one. Perhaps I will make this an annual tradition. For all my friends and family who complained that my first puzzle ran on a Friday and they can never solve Fridayswell … now is your chance to tackle a Saturday instead! It has been pointed out to me that I am the first female constructor to write a Saturday puzzle since 2014. For those who are excited because a female constructor surely means fewer sports references … sorry. I was really excited when I got “AL East” in there as an atonement for including “ALers” last timewhich I am well aware is a term that has been used in the real world by pretty much zero real baseball fansof which I am very much one. A resident of OaklandI had originally envisioned 32A to be an additional sports reference (my probably-too-hard clue: “Curryfor one”) and even when I submitted the puzzle back in Octoberassumed that it would be in reference to the 2016 N.B.A. Champions … but alas. It’s fine. Cleveland was due. And contrary to popular beliefmy hometown of Minneapolis did *not* take over the longest professional sports championship drought; thank you very muchMinnesota Lynx. Howeveras much as I could ramble on about sportsnone of the sports words were actually the seeds. FOOD COMA and BABY BUMP (which morphed into BABY MAMA when I decided that ESPNS was too much of a stretcheven though there seems to be 17 different ESPNs these days) were my first seeds in opposing corners. ALONE TIME (which would have been a debut at the time I submitted) and I CAN’T EVEN were the seeds in the other corners. At one point in the lower leftI had REPLY ALLS (as in “This e-mail thread has too many unnecessary reply-alls”) before deciding thatlike ESPNthat wasn’t really a noun that should be pluralized. The less interesting — but more legit — REPAYABLE replaced it. After the seedsI was pretty happy that the middle section gluing the four corners turned out some nice entries as well. I hadn’t attempted a grid quite this open in the middle beforeand was delighted to get the aforementioned sports entriesas well as ROT GUT and PEN NAME to fall out. Finallyas I wrote the puzzle last fallmy clue for 46-across was obviously different. (I believe I referred to the Curious George authors.) But I’m pretty excited that Will went the Star Wars route here. Rey was my favorite of the new characters.

A very enjoyable Saturday outingMs. Rhode. Come back soon.

 4499,  1993, a, DRESSED in jeansa black jacket and recycled shoesMartina Navratilova floated up the escalator into the hotwhite light of the television camerassome kind of blondcasual goddess rising from the sea.

Smiling but moving as fast as one of her groundstrokesshe blistered through the tonylargely gay crowd waiting breathlessly to see her in the upper reaches of Madison Square Garden on Wednesday night. A few mumbled hellos and she was gonetucked safely away inside one of those rooms reserved for stars like her at times like these.

It seemed her miniature fox terrierK.D. (Killer Dog) had become agitated by all the lights and noise and people gathered at the Paramount for A Lesbian and Gay Tribute to Martinaa fund-raising event sponsored by the Gay Games IV and Cultural Festivalan Olympic-style sporting and cultural event that will be held around New York City next June. This was announced by Ms. Navratilova's handlers-for-the-nightidentified by the I'm-Very-Serious looks they wore chiseled on their faces. Ms. Navratilova also needed a moment to recover from the crush.

THE photographers grumbled. Some people who had paid money to be there grumbled. But Marge Sherwin did not grumble. She trembled. After years of admiring Ms. Navratilova as much for her honesty about being a lesbian as for her tennis gameand after a hellish two-and-a-half-hour commute from her home on the East End of Long Island to attend this tributeMarge Sherwin had found herself and her camera right in Ms. Navratilova's path.
 3243,  2000, a, Mentally ill people who have heart attacks are less likely to be offered the kind of treatment customarily available to other patientsa new study reports.

In some casesYale researchers wrote in The Journal of the American Medical Associationpatients with conditions like schizophrenia are 32 percent less likely to undergo cardiovascular procedures.

The researchers came to their conclusions after reviewing the cases of 113,653 patients 65 or older who had had heart attacks -- 5,653 of whom were listed as mentally ill.

They found that those patients with mental disorders were 25 percent less likely to be given angioplasty to remove blockages32 percent less likely to have bypass surgery and 28 percent less likely to have cardiac catheterization.

 4888,  1990, a, The council was formed during the campaign to help Mr. Dinkins to deal with the budget deficit.

''Expanding it is one of the things I want to do rather early on,'' Mr. Dinkins said of the panel. ''For instancethere are no women on it.''

Mr. Dinkins said he may also announce more appointments within the next two days. So far about half of the top government jobs have been filled. But Mr. Dinkins said it was unlikely he would immediately appoint people to head the departments of transportationlabor and human services.

A Few Koch People

''We need to look at where we are in the whole search process,'' he said. ''We have things in varying degrees of progress in the pipelines. In some instances we may have have a finalist and I have yet to interview him. In other instancesthe search committees are yet at worknot yet fully satisfied that they have exhausted the reservoir.''

Until nowMr. Dinkins has generally reached beyond the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch in forming his government. That may change.

''There will be one or more Koch people retained,'' in high level positionsMr. Dinkins saidrefusing to provide any names.

Mr. Dinkins said he has tried - in his appointments - to live up to a campaign promise of making city government racially diverse.

'By GodWhat a Rainbow'

''I would hope the first impression one would have when looking at my appointments would be excellencecompetence,'' he said. ''And then'By Godwhat a rainbow.' ''
 1579,  2010, a, Our House forecasting model continues to show Republicans as having about a two-in-three chance — 67 percent — of taking over the House on Nov. 2similar to the forecast in recent weeks.

The most likely number of Republican pickups is in the range of about 45 seats — although significantly larger or smaller gains remain possible. The model does not expect a clean sweep: Democrats are favorites in 4 seats currently held by Republicans. But Republicans are favorites in exactly 50 Democratic-held seatsaccording to the modelwhich would be enough to give them control of the House.

As in past weeksthe various indicators that the model uses to formulate its forecasts show varied patterns.

The Democrats’ position in the generic ballot has improved slightly. But they remain about 6 points behind the Republicans among likely voters.

Expert forecasterslike Cook Political and the Rothenberg Political Reportcontinue to move their characterizations of races slowly but steadily in the direction of Republicans.

Local polling tends to be ambiguous. There were a handful of poor polls for Democrats this week — onefor instanceshowed the outspoken incumbent Alan Grayson trailing in his race in Florida’s 8th congressional district. But in other districtsDemocrats have released campaign polls showing themselves to be in a reasonably strong positionand Republican campaigns have not always countered them.

As we remarked last weekDemocrats seem to be in a more vulnerable position in the Midwest than elsewhere in the country. Of the 50 Democratic-held seats that the model regards Republicans having at least even odds of gaining6 are in Pennsylvaniaand 3 are in Ohioand several seats in MichiganIllinois and Iowa are also vulnerable.

While Republicans are more likely than not to take over the Housethere are comparatively few individual seats in which they are overwhelming favorites: there are “only” 20 Democratic-held seats that the model assigns them at least a 80 percent chance of picking upfor exampleand only 7 where they have at least a 90 percent chance.

But a much wider list of seats — possibly as many as 90 or even 100 — could conceivably fall into Republican hands. Unless there is either a shift in Democrats’ direction between now and Nov. 2or the polling proves to underestimate themthe party will probably either lose the House or come perilously close to doing so. They have only about a 10 percent chance of holding onto 230 or more seats in the new Congressaccording to the modelwhich might allow them to retain a reasonably functional working majority.

* * *

You may notice that we’re in the process of rolling out additional detail on the House forecasts. Each contest now has its own race pagefor instancewhich we have released in beta form — see for example the pages for Illinois’ 10th congressional district or Florida’s 24th.

In addition to charting the evolution of the forecast in each district over timethese pages also contain a list of pollsincluding those released by campaigns. Bear in mind as you browse these pages that local polling is but one of several inputs in our House modeland not always the most important one. In additionthe polls — particularly those released by campaigns — are subject to heavy adjustments of various kinds. We are working on various types of graphics that will convey a more comprehensive view of how our forecasts are calculated.
 4414,  1993, a, Complaints of police misconduct included in civil lawsuits will be investigated immediately by the New York City Police Department as part of the expanded duties of the new Internal Affairs BureauPolice Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly announced yesterday.

Previouslylawsuits based on such complaints as excessive forcefalse arrestassault and civil rights violations had to wend their way through the courts before the department conducted more than cursory reviews. Nowinvestigations could lead to departmental hearings long before the lawsuits are heardhelping the city to decide whether to represent the officer or whether criminal charges should be drawn.

Jeremy TravisDeputy Commissioner for Legal Affairssaid the new policy could also reduce the amount the city pays out in settlements against police officersbut added that was not the primary impetus for the change. He estimated that 200 to 300 cases a year would be investigated.

In making the announcement yesterdayCommissioner Kellywho in November ordered sweeping changes in the way the department monitors its integritysaid the new procedure would "enhance the role of the new Internal Affairs Bureau and give it the mandate to weed out police officers who abuse their public trust."

 5761,  1985, a, ''I've never been number oriented,'' he said. ''I don't believe in saying this game ranks first or that game ranks second. But there have been several games that I could roll into a ballso to speakas the most meaningful of my career.''

Quicklyhe mentioned four games early in his Met career.

''The game against the Cubs at Shea in 1969 when I had a no-hitter going into the ninth. The game I struck out 19 against San Diego in 1970and another game in 1970 in Los Angeles when I struck out 16 in 12 innings before I went out with the score 1-1. And the game in 1969 when I won 20 games for the first timethat always stays with you.''

Almost a year to the day after being traded to the Redshe pitched a 4-0 no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals.

''I didn't have great stuff that nightbut I had some great plays behind me,'' he said. ''And whenever I got hit hardit was right at somebody.''

For all his victoriesTom Seaver didn't start thinking about winning 300 until last year.

''When I came back to the Mets after having had a sore shoulder in 1982 with the RedsI didn't know if I'd ever pitch again,'' he said. ''But then I pitched pretty well in 1983and then when I continued to pitch well with the White Sox last yearI realized that I was getting close. I knew another good year would get me there.''

With an 11-8 record this seasonhe has one more start before Tuesday's strike deadline.

''I'm not trying to beat the strike,'' Tom Seaver said. ''I'm going to get 300 anyway.''

He should be getting it for the Metsand if he weremaybe the Mets would have won the National League East last yearmaybe they would be in first place now. But the reason he's with the White Sox goes back to 1966 when Roland Hemondnow the White Sox general managerwas the California Angels' scouting director.

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that Paul H. O'Neillthe chairmanmade the comment to securities analysts last week at an Alcoa plant in Iowa. Alcoa has spent at least $100 million on the packaging and had set this year as a deadline.

The company has said the packaging could generate $3 billion in revenue in 5 to 10 years. It was one of the few non-aluminum products Alcoa has pursued under Mr. O'Neill.

Early in “Being Flynn,” the new movie directed by Paul WeitzJonathan Flynn slides behind the wheel of a yellow cab as his voiceon the soundtrackgives vent to a barrage of misanthropy. It is hard for a movie lover not to detect a wink in this otherwise perfectly ordinary scenesince Jonathan is played by Robert De Nirothe most famous taxi driver in movies. “Being Flynn” is a much milder movie than “Taxi Driver,” pursuing intimate themes rather than big ideasbut Jonathan Flynn and Travis Bickle are linked by the discrepancy between self-image and reality and also by Mr. De Niro’s gift for portraying alienated men at odds with themselves.

He has not done much of that lately. Moviegoers too young for “Taxi Driver” or “Raging Bull” know him as the comically menacing patriarch of the “Meet the Parents” moviesthe last of which was directed by Mr. Weitz. And while his performance as Jonathan Flynn strays now and then into histrionics (not without reason)it also provides a reminder of what a resourcefulunpredictable and subtle actor Mr. De Niro can be.

Jonathan runs on vodkaorange juicebile and delusions of grandeur. He is a writerand in his own estimation one of only three in American letters worth bothering withthe other two being Mark Twain and J. D. Salinger. His own shaggyrambling mannerand his shabby circumstancessuggest Charles Bukowskibut with more blarney and less compassion. “We are put on this earth to help other people” is his mottobut in practice it seems to mean that everyone else on earth should either see to his needs or leave him alone.

Jonathan is not the only Flynnor the only writerin “Being Flynn.” The movie is equally the story of his sonNickwho grew up with his mother (Julianne Moore) and the legend of his absent dad. Jonathan served time in federal prison for passing bad checkswriting letters to Nick that fed the boy’s literary ambition but even after release never showing up in person. In his 20s Nickplayed by Paul Danostarts working at a homeless shelter where Jonathanafter losing his apartment and his jobhappens to take up residence. The two of them establish a difficultpainful and ambiguous connection. The real Nick Flynn wrote about this in a memoir with a title too pungent and profane for me to repeat here. Mr. Weitzwhose adaptation has been approved by Mr. Flynnhas softened and streamlined the storybut his desire to retain some of the book’s candor and poetry is evident. Sometimes awkwardly and sometimes gracefully“Being Flynn” charts a middle course between the rough honesty of its source and the sentimental triteness of the much worse movie it could have been.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

The melodrama of parent-child reconciliationof redemption and recovery and hard lessons tenderly learned is a staple of movies and televisionand the magnetic pull of that therapeutic genre is hard to resist. It is to Mr. Weitz’s credit that he tries. He does not force Jonathan and Nick into teary embraces or ringing speeches but rather lets Mr. Dano and Mr. De Niro find their own rhythmswhich don’t always harmonize. Mr. Dano is a quietinscrutable presencebut has an odd charismaa blend of sensitivity and bottled-up ragethat makes him an intriguing foil for Mr. De Niroas he was for Daniel Day-Lewis in “There Will be Blood.”

The drama in “Being Flynn” arises partly from the battle between the two Flynns about whose story it is. Jonathan certainly knows how to call attention to himself. Nick is more diffident and watchfuland it is easier to sympathize with someone tormented by the death of his mother and the toxic legacy of his father’s neglect. He has his own self-destructive patterns of behaviorbut these are examined more superficially than his father’swhich is too bad.

 2183,  2006, a, Encyclopedia Hanasiana offer a very simple diagram that is funnier and smarter than anything the Bagger has said all seasonwhich is not a very high barbut still. We all know Philip Seymour Hoffman is a lockbut no one can articulate why. Jim Hanas explains it all with one little graphic and a bit of annotation:

It used to be that to win an Oscaryou had to play someone handicapped. That all changed last year when playing famous proved to be Oscar goldwith Jamie Foxx and Cate Blanchett bagging statuettes for portraying Ray Charles and Katharine Hepburnrespectively. That trend continues—five of this year’s 20 actor nominees earned nods for portraying famous personages—but playing gay is coming on strong. With trends collidingalmost half of this year’s nominations went to portrayals of people who are famous and/or gay. Consulting the diagram belowI don’t see how Philip Seymour Hoffman can possibly lose.
 307,  2017, a, His tenure has been doggedthoughby suggestions of uneasy relationships with some of his players — most notably Messi — and by accusations that his coaching style does not follow the elegant template laid down at Barcelona by Johan Cruyff and Pep Guardiola. His meetings with Catalonia’s ravenous news media have also been consistently fractious.

Enrique had warned Robert FernándezBarcelona’s sporting directorbefore this season that he might not sign the new contract the club was prepared to offer him. Discussions over that deal had stalled in recent monthsand it is quite likely that Enrique’s announcement that he would step down did not come as a shock to the club.

Barcelona now has three months to identify the most suitable replacement. Ernesto Valverdethe experienced coach of Athletic Bilbaohas considerable support among Barcelona’s executives as well as his own Barcelona connection: He won the now-defunct UEFA Cup Winners’ Cup as a player for the club in 1989. That his Athletic side beat Barcelona in this season’s Spanish Super Cup could add weight to his case.

Jorge Sampaolithe coach of Sevillais the other leading contender. In his first job in European soccerSampaoli has turned Sevilla into a genuine contender for the Spanish titleand the expansive playing style he prefers is seen by some as dovetailing neatly with Barcelona’s traditions.

Sampaoli is also on the cusp of qualifying for the quarterfinals of the Champions Leaguesomething Barcelona — which was beaten4-0in the first leg of its round of 16 matchup with Paris St.-Germain — is unlikely to do.

 272,  2018, a, Historians will measure the presidency of George H.W. Bush in familiar ways — by how well or poorly he managed the major domestic and international challenges of his timehis leadership qualitiesthe moral and social legacies he left for future generations.

Yetat the moment of his passingit is difficult not to take note of the profound differences between the 41st president of the United States and the current occupant of the White HouseDonald Trump. Beyond a desire to be president — Mr. Bush was more competitive and ambitious than his self-effacing personality sometimes suggested — there is almost nothing in common: the one gracious and modestthe other rude and vain; the one prudentthe other brash; the one steadythe other unmoored.

Mr. Bush’s death on Friday is also a moment to recall a less quarrelsome political orderwhen relations with traditional allies were more cordial than combativewhen government attracted people of talent and integrity for whom public service offered a purpose higher than self-enrichmentwhen the Republican Partythough slowly slipping into the tentacles of zealots like Newt Gingrichstill offered room for people with pragmatic policies and sensible dispositions.

Mr. Bush’s tenure was shorter than he had hopedand ended ingloriously in a lopsided defeat at the hands of an upstart governor from ArkansasBill Clintonpresaged by a huge drop in Mr. Bush’s approval rating from nearly 90 percent at the time of the 1991 Gulf War to the mid-30s in the summer before the election. Fingers pointed in every direction after his defeat — a deteriorating economya divisive convention in Houstona disjointed campaign. But one big reason for Mr. Bush’s precipitous fall was Mr. Bush himselfchiefly his inability to convince Americans that he understood the depth of their fears or could summon up a coherent plan for addressing them.

Wallowing in mood over eventmoment over entirety“North Sea Texas” demands complete surrender to the maturing of Pim (Jelle Florizoone)a sensitive 14-year-old trapped in a tiny Belgian coastal town.

“The boy lives in a world of his own,” opines Pim’s accordion-playingrestlessly disappointed single motherYvette (Eva Van Der Gucht). Sealed in that worldPim surreptitiously spritzes Yvette’s perfume and crushes painfully on his leather-jacketed best friendGino (Mathias Vergels). Burning looks in the garden shed lead to experimentation in a pup tentbut when Ginoa floppy-haired charmertakes his experiments across the aisleheartbreak is not far behind.

Directed by Bavo Defurne (working from a novel by André Sollie)“North Sea Texas” is calm and rapt — no hysterical adolescent passions here — a simmering drama powered by fully drawn characters and fine performances. And with its indeterminate period setting and tarnished-sunlight glow (courtesy of the gifted cinematographer Anton Mertens)the film has a delicatedreamlike quality that’s quite affecting. But Pim’s withdrawn demeanor and inability to verbalize his emotions — the character is basically one big ache — make it more challenging than it should be to immerse ourselves in his journey.

Displayed in a somewhat out-of-the-way locationthese works of potterybasketrybeadworkpainting and sculptureall on loan from a major private collectionare of incandescent beauty. They encompass nearly three centuries and a broad geographical rangefrom the Eastern woodlands stretching north into Canadato the Great Plainsto the Northwest coast as far as Alaska. The result is a masterpiece exhibition that also introduces a major art tradition. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).

''THE TIME OF OUR LIVES,'' New Museum of Contemporary Art583 Broadwaynear Prince StreetSoHo(212) 219-1222 (through Oct. 17). This alternately sappy and insightful exhibition is the swan song of Marcia Tuckerwho is retiring as the founding director of the museum after 22 years. It is personaltopicalrough around the edges and intent on raising consciousness. It ignores most esthetic issues to bring together a broad array of art and artifactsfrom paintings to television commercialspertaining to a chargedoften painful issue in our youth-driven society: growing old. There are some wonderful momentsseveral involving large photographs of the agedwith Manabu Yamanaka's images of spiritedtime-ravaged ancient Japanese women being the most impressive. But the overall result is less an art exhibition than a multifaceted learning experience that too often sinks into an atmosphere of piousnesspublic service and pedagogy. The show's theme comes most to life in its film and video sectionwhich ranges from choice segments of ''Maude'' and ''Cybill'' through animated short films like Gail Noonan's ''Your Name in Cellulite'' to Yvonne Rainer's complexly powerful ''Privilege,'' a meditation on timememory and menopause. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundaysnoon to 6 P.M.; Thursdays through Saturdaysnoon to 8 P.M. Admission: $5; $3studentsartists and the elderly (Smith).

''ANDY WARHOL: 'THE LAST SUPPER,' '' Guggenheim Museum SoHo575 Broadwayat Prince Street(212) 423-3500 (open-ended). It is always depressing to see an important artist operating below parand it doesn't help that the Guggenheim's recently downsized SoHo space feels moribund or that the exhibition is ethically questionable. (The paintings are partly owned by a Guggenheim trustee who also owns the building.) The atmosphere hovers between gallery back roomgargantuan lobby exhibition and study collection. The 63 paintings and works on paper all appropriate Leonardo's ''Last Supper'' fresco in Milan. They show Warhol churning through his arsenal of once-brilliant techniques: the silk-screened grids of imagesthe camouflage patternthe big close-upsthe quasi-commercial black-on-white renderings are all herebut they are rarely on target. The exhibition suggests that Warhol was at his weakest when he borrowed from art history. It was the transformation of the tawdry symbols of popular culture that gave his art its iconic poweremotional pull and ineffable mystery. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays11 A.M. to 6 P.M. Admission: $8; $5students and the elderly (Smith).

A salute to fine-press publications printed in the 20th centurythis exhibition features 100 judged the best by two expertsMartin Hutner and Jerry Kelly. Fine-press editionswhich run from fewer than 100 to maybe 1,500 copiesare meant to glorify the written word with masterly use of typographyillustrationbindinglayoutpaper and press work. Those shown hereissued by presses in the United States and Europerange from a smallwitty salute to that useful connectorthe ampersandto books illustrated by Matisse and Picassoto sobermonumental editions of the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer. Among the most striking of the illustrated texts is Matisse's ''Jazz,'' published in France in 1947an eye-feast of 20 full-color stencil prints inspired by the hot music of the time. But there are many remarkable texts that rely solely on the beauty of typelike the five-volume English Bible put out by the Doves Press in Britain (1903-05). The show leaves no doubt that despite the inroads of digital information storagethe art of fine-book publishing is alive and well (Glueck).

DONN DAVISJoseph Rickards1045 Madison Avenueat 79th Street (212) 924-0858 (through Oct. 9). Mr. Davishere having his first New York solo exhibitioncombs the city for discarded typographic materials and creates abstractgridded collages of certain elements like o's or x's. They are elegant and catchily rhythmic. (Johnson).

SAMUEL GOTTSCHO''New York: Night and Day,'' Allan Klotz Photocollect22 East 72d Street(212) 327-2211 (through Oct. 23). The carefulpatient architectural photographs of Manhattan made by Gottscho (1875-1971) during the early 1930's were a reaction to what he considered the sloppy work produced by the newfast 35-millimeter cameras. By daylight his photographs were clearly delineated viewspanoramasskylines or close-ups of single structureslike a spectacular view of the RCA Building that looks up at the structure's towering geometry. By nighthe captured the city's glamorous glowfor examplein a view of Broadway and Times Square from 41 stories up in which lights blazing from animated signs and the darkened bulk of buildings give real dimension to the moniker ''The Great White Way.'' Aside from its esthetic appealthe show is a great wallow in New York nostalgia (Glueck).

 2158,  2006, a, For buildings with hot-water heating systemsit is possible to make adjustments by using an "outdoor reset control." With such a deviceMr. Gifford saidthe temperature of the water coursing through the building can be adjusted up or down in response to the outdoor temperature.

"It's like a dimmer switch for the heating system," he said.

He explained that while hot water systems without a reset control are either "all on" during the heating cycle or "all off" between cyclessystems that use the device always have hot water running through the pipesbut they vary the temperature of that water according to the outdoor temperature. As a resultMr. Gifford saidthe system produces just the amount of heat the building needs at a given momentand does so more evenly.

Steam systems have even more noticeable peaks and valleys of heat and cold because they are always either "all on" or "all off" and because it is generally not possible to vary the temperature of steam.

One way for building owners or managers to balance temperatures in steam-heated buildingsMr. Gifford saidis to install a thermostat on each radiator.

"Thermostatic radiator valves use no electricityare easy to install and cost from $40 to $50 each," he saidexplaining that the valves have a sensor that opens and closes the radiator in response to the temperature in the room.

In buildings with two-pipe steam heating systems - basically older buildings with seven or more floors - these valves replace the on-off valve on the radiator. In one-pipe steam systems - usually found in buildings less than seven stories high - a thermostatic valve can replace the air vent.

"It doesn't shut off the radiator completelybut it can reduce the heat output," Mr. Gifford said.

Edward Winiarskipresident of Optimum Applied Systems in HawthorneN.Y.said his company's Heat Computer system provides another way of controlling heat in large buildings. Internal temperatures in a building are monitored with remote sensors - wired or wireless - that are installed in a select number of apartments. Once temperatures in a majority of these apartments reach a preset levelthe computer turns off the heat.

The systemwhich costs from $3,000 for a basic model to $10,000 for a unit with 18 sensorsis guaranteed to produce savings of at least 15 percent over the course of the heating seasonaccording to Mr. Winiarski.

 3899,  1997, a, The three-day symposiumwhich has been meeting in private since Thursdayis part of what Pope John Paul today called a general ''examination of conscience'' that is necessary as Christianity prepares to celebrate its third millennium. Its purposewhich is more theological than historicalis to examine Christian thought for prejudice against Judaismas well as against Jews.

In the text of the Pope's comments made public by the VaticanJohn Paul joined other Roman Catholic theologians in acknowledging that by blaming the Jews for the death of Jesuscertain Christian teachings had helped fuel anti-Semitism.

''In the Christian world -- I do not say on the part of the church as such -- the wrong and unjust interpretations of the New Testament relating to the Jewish people and their presumed guilt circulated for too longcontributing to feeling of hostility toward these people,'' he said.

''These contributed to soothing consciences,'' the Pope said''to the point that when a wave of persecutions swept Europe fueled by a pagan anti-Semitism -- which in its essence was equal to anti-Christianism -- next to those Christians who did everything to save the persecuted at the risk of their own livesthe spiritual resistance of many was not that which humanity expected from the disciples of Christ.''

During the 19 years of his pontificateJohn Paul has made significant progress in improving relations between the the Catholic Church and Jews. Todayhe again emphasized the common heritage that binds Christians and Jews. Those who consider Jesus' Jewish heritage as a ''simple cultural accident,'' he saiddo a disservice to history and to Christianity.

 6260,  1973, a, PHILADELPHIAOct. 2—Idle Dice made his task look easy tonight when he won the first open jumper class in a jumpoff at the start of the six‐day Philadelphia Horse Show at the Spectrum.

Owned by Harry Gill and ridden by Rodney Jenkinsthe aged brown gelding—the top money‐winning jumper in horse‐show history — defeated five rivals for the blue ribbon.

 3898,  1997, a, His committee spent far too much time early in the hearings proving points that were not in dispute.

Senator Thompson and his staff also proved to be inept at stage management. Before the public sessions startedhe told every interviewer that one of his main tasks was to put on a good show so that people would pay attentionbut he never did so.

The committee's lawyers questioned witnesses endlessly on minor points. The committee's senators spent day after day delivering monologues serially rather than questioning witnesses. And testimony compelling enough to interest the television networks was often offered at times when it was not convenient for the networks to broadcast it.

On the question of exposing the flaws in the campaign finance systemSenator Thompson contendswith some justificationthat the attention generated by his investigation was a factor in the agreement by Republican leaders to allow votes next March on changes in the campaign finance law.

''We've had the first real substantive debate on campaign finance reform in 20 years,'' Senator Thompson said today. ''We played a part in thatand I'm proud.''

But he and the other senators from both parties were never willing to address squarely the fact that the campaign finance system is based on a fiction: the proposition that donors give large amounts of money to politicians and expect nothing concrete in return and that politicians accept money without feeling obligated to give something in return.

The truth is that perfectly legal donations brought out in the hearings -- a $300,000 donation from a wheeler-dealer who wanted to build a pipeline from the Caspian Seaa $230,000 contribution from Indian tribes that got a favorable ruling from the Interior Departmenta $50,000 contribution from a corporate executive who received a phone call from President Clinton -- might be considered bribery or extortion in other walks of life.

 5478,  1987, a, The American Embassy is not sure whether it ever issued a visa to Col. Gregorio Honasanthe fugitive leader of last month's attempted coup. But just to be on the safe sideit has canceled any such visa he may have.

The cancellationwidely publicized herewas the latest gesture by the United States to reaffirm its support for the Government and quell continuing rumors that it may somehow have been involved in the unsuccessful coup.

America's influence in the Philippines - and an often exaggerated sense of that influence - grows out of the former colonial relationship between the two nations and leads to sometimes delicate byplay between the embassy and the Philippine public.

The first of the recent gestures came in the early hours of the uprising Aug. 28when the Government appeared to be in peril and the embassy scrambled to issue a statement of support for President Corazon C. Aquino. Ambassador Newly Arrived

 2818,  2003, a, Many Ferris wheel fans stay on the Wonder Wheel at the Coney Island boardwalk for more than one stomach-flipping ridebut none take as many spins as Katowho most days rides the wheel from the moment it opens at noon until it closes at midnight. Then it's time for Kato to get to work.

Not that he has a long commute. Kato is a doga mix of German shepherd and Akitaand when he's not riding the 150-foot-high Wonder Wheelwhich towers over the Cyclone roller coasterhe's guarding it.

''He's on the night shift,'' said Dennis D. Vourderiswho with his brotherSteveowns the Ferris wheel and 21 smaller rides and attractions surrounding it. From midnight to noonKato walks around the fenced-in Wonder Wheel compound. But when he's off-duty and it is not raining or too coldKato prefers riding the Wheel to heading home to the dog run he shares with the park's three other guard dogs.

Many people first spot Kato as he spins past in his specially modified cagelike carwhile they are waiting in line. ''They think it's quite comical,'' Dennis Vourderis said. ''They try to get his attentionand then they see his head pop up. Sometimes he just barks at people in line.''

The gunfire killed Nicola Caliparian Italian intelligence agent who was in the back seat with Ms. Sgrena. The driver and Ms. Sgrena were wounded. Lt. Gen. John R. Vinesthe ground commander in Iraqhas approved a recommendation that soldiers involved in the shooting not be disciplinedthe military said.

The report's exoneration of the soldierswhich was made public last weekangered Italian officials and threatened to further inflame relations between the United States and Italyone of its staunchest allies in the war in Iraq. The findings have created a political problem for the Italian prime ministerSilvio Berlusconiwho faces a public upset by the incident at a time when his own fortunes are sagging.

Italy has kept 3,000 troops in Iraqbut Mr. Berlusconi has suggested that Italy might begin withdrawing them by September.

 5563,  1986, a, From a speech delivered by Senator William ProxmireDemocrat of Wisconsinbefore the Senate on April 28:

My Myth of the Day is that the vast majority of our nation's nearly eight and one-half million unemployed workers are receiving unemployment compensation benefits.

Losing a job is a terrible blow to an individual and his or her family. Even under the most generous unemployment compensation programsonly a portion of a worker's salary is replaced by unemployment benefits.

Even with these benefitsthe families of unemployed workers are often forced to postpone all but absolutely necessary spending and may have to go into debt. How much tougher the situation becomes if no unemployment compensation benefits are available while a worker seeks a new job.

This is why we should concern ourselves with the fact that there has been an astonishing decline in the percentage of those unemployed individuals who are collecting unemployment insurance benefits.

PCB'sor polychlorinated biphenlyswere used as coolants in electrical transformers before the Federal Government banned them in 1977. Many transformers in utility power circuits and electrified railway cars built before the banhoweverstill contain the substance. At high temperatures it becomes a cancer-causing agent that can be spread by smoke and soot.

 7415,  1964, a, JOSEPH SCHMIDT: tenor (Capitol T 10367). The extraordinarily brilliant tenor voice of the diminutive Joseph Schmidt (1904‐42) is heard here in the music he waa forced to sing because he was less than 5 feet tall. Because he could not appear successfully on the opera stageradio became his only outletand this disk's selections —popular German songs and excerpts from films and operettas from the tenor's days with the Berlin radio in the 1930's—not only furnish examples of the radiant voice but are also a documentaryof German popular music before the Second World War. There is no depression reflected in the gay tunes and waltzes nor much originality. The album is chiefly recommended for those interested in freak voices of phenomenal range andbrilliance.
 5383,  1987, a, Even before ABC's mini-series ''Amerika'' had begun productionpowerful foes were trying to keep it off the air. In 1985the Kremlin warned ABC's Moscow bureau of possible reprisals if the show ran.

Earlier this yearUnited Nations officials criticized the seven-part serieswhich is scheduled to begin Feb. 15for portraying corrupt international peacekeeping forces joining the K.G.B. in a takeover of the United States. A number of religious and disarmament organizations have also opposed the serieswhile Reed Irvine of the conservative group Accuracy in Media complained it made the Soviet occupiers seem too nice.

Perhaps the biggest blow came last week when the Chrysler Corporation decided that its commercialskeyed to the theme ''The Pride is Back - Born in America,'' were inappropriate for a series about Soviet conquest. After viewing six hours of itChrysler's chairmanLee A. Iacoccadecided to cancel about $7 million worth of commercials.

Chrysler was the largest sponsorbut ABC officials vowed that the show would go on. Meanwhilethe Sovietswho have denounced ''Amerika'' as ''psychological warfare,'' are offering to buy it for Soviet televisionapparently as an example of American propaganda.

A Human Life

By Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg

225 pp. Yale University Press. $25.

“Moses fails to enter Canaannot because his life is too shortbut because it is a human life.” So read Franz Kafka’s diary entry on Oct. 191921. The subtitle of Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg’s new biography of Moses“A Human Life,” is a tribute to Kafka. By casting her psychological portrait of the prophet under the auspices of the Prague writerZornberg ushers the reader into the sinuousmetaphysical angst of a man facing the divine and the elusive meaning of life.

A celebrated biblical scholarkeen on weaving together traditional Jewish exegesispsychoanalysis and postmodern criticismZornberg always displays minute attention to the psychological subtext of the Scriptures. Her previous work“Bewilderments,” had already captured Moses in the desertridden by skepticism.

Expanding her inquiry to his whole existence in this current bookshe shows how Moses’ flaws and shortcomings function as a metaphor for humanity as he confronts God’s will and struggles to convey his word. Moses is a stammering leader whom God prevented from entering the Promised Land. When he glimpses that place of milk and honey shortly before his deathit only emphasizes the incompleteness of his life’s work.

Since the Jewish tradition holds Moses to be the author of the Pentateuchthe first five books of the Bibleand even more specifically of the fourth bookNumbersZornberg claims to find autobiography in the biblical text. She conjures up the world of Moses as an adopted infanthis origins cloaked in silencea Hebrew raised at the Egyptian court whose identity was revealed to him only as an adult. Zornberg sees these beginnings as the reason for his “fragmented state of being.” It is the lot of prophets to accept their task reluctantly — it is even more accurate for Moseswhose own identity as a Hebrew was fraught with uncertainty and whoas a resultcould never act as a natural leader.

 4488,  1993, a, John M. Todda Roman Catholic publisher and scholar who wrote sympathetic studies of Martin Luther and John Wesleydied at his home in SomersetEnglandon June 9. He was 75.

In 1959after several years as an editor at Longmans GreenMr. Todd and two other members of the publishing concern left to found DartonLongman & Toddan ecumenical religious publishing house. As Catholic editorMr. Todd published Karl RahnerYves Congar and Henri de Lubac among European theologians as well as the Canadian Bernard Lonergan and the Indian Raymond Panikkar.

Overshadowing all the concern's other publicationshoweverwas the 1966 Jerusalem Biblea new popular English translation modeling itself on a translation done by French scholars in the 1950's.

Even before the Second Vatican Council opened a new era of ecumenical ties between Christian churchesMr. Todd's own books"John Wesley and the Catholic Church" (1958) and "Martin Luther: A Biographical Study" (1964)had departed from the polemical attitudes long marking Catholic studies of Protestant leaders. A Conscientious Objector
 3297,  2000, a, ''There's a strong feeling this is a marriagenot an affair,'' the official said.

Mr. Mehta was one of 40 candidates offered by the recruiting firm of Spencer Stuart & Associatesbut he quickly topped the listMr. Guenther said. ''We were told the best is Zarin Mehtabut you'll never get him,'' he said. He called Mr. Mehta ''the best executive director in the country.''

Mr. Mehtasince 1990 president and chief executive officer of Raviniathe open-air music festival in Highland Parknear Chicagothe Chicago Symphony Orchestra's summer home since 1936said that his appointmentgiven his family's historywas ''an extraordinary move for me.'' In addition to his brother's involvement with the Philharmonichis fatherMehli Mehtaa violinist and conductorstudied in New York in the 1940's. A cousinBejun Mehtais a countertenor who as a boy soprano sang for Leonard Bernstein.

By contrastZarin Mehtawho was born in Bombayentered the music world as an accountant. Trained in Englandhe sought an accounting job in New York in 1962 but was turned away for fear he might head back to Europe or go to Canada to escape the Vietnam-era draft. He did move to Canada to work for the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand and joined the board of the Montreal Symphony Orchestrabecoming its vice president. In 1981 he was named managing director and served until 1990when he took over the Ravinia Festival.

His musical training was nilhe said proudly. ''My parents successfully kept me away from it,'' he said. For his administrative dutieshe said''accounting is better than being an oboe player.'' He said he looked forward to working with Mr. Masur andif plans jelledwith Mr. Muti. ''It's a very strange marriagemusic director and executive director,'' he said. ''They're jointly responsible. They have to be thinking along the same lines.''

Could he have worked with his brotherZubin? He didn't pause to consider it. ''We would have fought tooth and nail,'' he said.

As for his plans for changes at the Philharmoniche said it would be presumptuous to speak of that yet. But he had one priority. ''I want to attend a parks concert,'' he said.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — Just yesterday we were discussing how you can’t always expect to find a crossword theme in the long Across entriesand today we have another example of just that. Susan Gelfand is back with a theme that will jump right out at youif you know where to look.

Today’s Theme

I’m not sure how many kids think of a JACK IN THE BOX as a fun toy (personallyI found them terrifying)but we have four symmetrical JACKs in BOXes today. The JACK part of the entry is a rebusso you would write or type JACK all in one square. If you’re solving in our iOS apphere’s how you enter more than one letter in a square:

Photo

The trick is knowing where to put those rebuses.

We have [JACK]ASS crossing [JACK] FROST[JACK] POTS crossing [JACK] CHEESEFLAP [JACK] crossing LUMBER [JACK] (clued brilliantly as “Strong feller?”as in feller of trees) and CAR [JACK] crossing PHONE [JACK].

The revealerJACK IN THE BOXis split today between 8D and 48D.

In nontheme newsI enjoyed RAVE MUSICSEA TURTLELEONINENUTELLA (because yum)MAHALIA Jackson and Eve ENSLERauthor of “The Vagina Monologues.”

Tricky Clues

– From the Department of Now You Know: A BRAINO consists of “words or parts of words being missed out or swapped around when somebody is speakingoften completely altering the meaning of what the person said. When it occursthe culprit normally doesn’t notice they did it until a few seconds laterand often not until it is too late.” An example would be “I’m feeling fine and walking the dog” becoming “I’m walking fine and feeling the dog.”{Urban Dictionary}

– When you see the phrase “First name in …” outside of crosswordsyou’re normally thinking of the most important person in a given genre. In this puzzlehoweveryou’re being asked to literally enter a first name in gospeland that would be MAHALIA (Jackson).

– At 68A“Jabber?” appears to be asking about the act of talking too much. Todayhoweverthe clue refers to something you can jab someone withlike an ÉPÉE.

– Clue of the Day for me was “Strong feller?” at 44D. A LUMBERJACK certainly could be a strong feller (for “fellow”)but you need to be a strong feller of trees to be a LUMBERJACK.

Have you ever seen a SEA TURTLE and 70-80 of its nearest and dearest hatch and head for the ocean? I find this mesmerizing:

Your thoughts?
 4385,  1994, a, In 1926when he was 12 years oldhe walked into a Washington bookstore with his parentsdipped into Crowe and Cavalcaselle's "North Italian Painting" and was never the same again.

He did not haveand never soughtany formal training in art history. But at Downsidea Benedictine school in Englandhe pursued his newfound vocation in every spare moment. Later he had a rigorous training as a political and intellectual historian at Balliol CollegeOxford.

After graduating in 1935he sold some islands off Borneo that had been bequeathed to him by an uncle and spent the money on two years of private art-history study in Europe.

He traveledhe lookedhe thought and he wrote. He also listened to senior art historiansmany of them refugees from Nazi Germanyand learned much from their methodologytheir standards of interpretation and their sometimes hilarious quirks. He could also characterize them in just a few wordsas when he referred to the "gentledogmaticunpersuasive voice" of an art historian who aspired to mate Marxism with 15th-century Italian art.

A new challenge always amused him. When appointed to the staff of the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1938he applied himself with memorable effect to the study of English portrait miniatureswhose distinction was underrated at the time.

After five years' service in air-force intelligence during World War IIhe returned to Europe in 1944. Never a blinkered specialisthe was one of the first Englishmen to report in print on recent work of Matisse and Picasso in the Salon d'Automne in liberated Paris.

When he rejoined the Victoria and Albert Museumhe stipulated that he be assigned to a department of which he knew nothing. Many years laterhe spoke almost with nostalgia of the ramified obligations that had come his way in great miscellaneous museumswhere he had had to deal with "everything from Victorian brass lecterns to filthy plastic bags full of the mummies of Peruvian children."

 5252,  1988, a, Why do they do it? Why do real-estate developers and other big business interests in New York contribute to political campaignscontribute so generously that their largess can still stun the uninitiated? (And sometimes the initiated.) The question is as fundamental as such matters get in politics. The answers areas recent hearings before a state panel demonstratednot so simple.

For two daysa glittery roster of developersthe newest category of New York City celebritytestified before the State Commission on Government Integrity to explainunder oathwhy they give money to public officialsespecially members of the city's powerful Board of Estimate -Mayor KochComptroller Harrison J. GoldinCity Council President Andrew J. Stein and the five borough presidents.

They touched on everything from the idealistic to the cynicalfrom civic responsibility to fondness for a candidate (and sometimes the candidate's rivaltoo). Some testified that they contributed on the advice of their public relations consultantand still others said they were afraid of retaliation if they did not make contributions.

The one interpretation that none providedand all rejectedwas the most negative and seemingly the most plausible: They give to get. It certainly looks that way. Consider the following cases:

* Robert Pressmanexecutive vice president of Barneys New Yorkthe retail companytestified that the Pressman family corporations contributed $5,000 to the Bronx Democratic Committee in January 1985; $10,000 to City Council President Andrew J. Stein on March 81985and $20,000 to Mr. Koch on April 28. Campaign records show another $5,000 contribution to the Mayor in May. It was on Feb. 281985that the Board of Estimate approved a plan for Barney's expansion. The contributions and the power of each board member to vote on the plan had ''nothing to do with each other,'' Mr. Pressman testified.

 385,  2016, a, ENTER RYAN FITZPATRICK

THE PUNCH

Not long before the Jets were scheduled to practice on Aug. 11a team spokesman walked into the press room at their complex and announced an impromptu news conference with Coach Todd Bowles.

The subject? Unclear. But it was urgent.

SeethingBowles revealed that Ikemefuna Enemkpalia reserve linebackerhad punched the presumptive starting quarterbackGeno Smithin the facebreaking his jaw and sidelining him for an estimated six to 10 weeks.

The punchprompted by an unpaid debtcost Enemkpali his job. Smith also lost his — because Ryan Fitzpatrick never gave it back.

As other backup quarterbacks floundered in starting rolesFitzpatrickon his fourth team in four seasonsflourished. He threw two touchdown passes in the opener against Cleveland and two more the next week at Indianapolis. Nowmore than three and a half months laterFitzpatrick is finishing one of the best seasons by a quarterback in Jets history.

Along the wayhe shed his reputation as a caretaker and became the reason the Jets won instead of the reason they did not lose.

Fitzpatrick needs one more touchdown toss and 284 more passing yards to set franchise records in those categories. It is harder to quantify his intangible qualities: the calm he projectsthe stability he providesthe trust he inspires.

His teammates wear T-shirts that say “FitzMagic.” They believe in him.

In the Jets’ tense December victories over the GiantsDallas and New EnglandFitzpatrick completed 67.9 percent of his passes (36 of 53) during the fourth quarter and overtimewith three touchdowns and no interceptions.

Smith has not pouted or bemoaned his circumstances. Had he never been sluggedmaybe hetoowould have thrived; maybe not. Maybe the Jets would have still won 10 games; maybe not.

It is not a hypothetical worth exploring. They are one victory from their first playoff berth since 2010 because of Fitzpatrickand they are better for it.

 4837,  1991, a, Q. Our finished basementwhich is used as a guestcomputer and sewing roomshows no signs of leaks; howeverit gets very humid in the summerso much so that mold grows on the furniturerecords and books. This area adjoins an unfinished part of the basement that contains the laundry. We have thought of running a dehumidifier all the time to control the moldbut I think this would be quite expensive. Is there anything else we can do to solve the humidity problem?

A. If the walls are finished or covered with paneling of some typethere may be seepage through the foundation walls that you cannot see. Alsocheck the outside to make sure that all surface water drains away from the foundationespecially water pouring out of the downspouts during a heavy rain. Finallyif the laundry area has a clothes dryermake sure it is vented directly to the outside. Otherwisethis could be the source of the humidity.

Q. I own a condominium in a high-rise building. Whenever I take a showerthe walls and ceiling of the bathroom are covered with moisture. I tried sizing the walls and running a fanbut this has not helped. Someone suggested I install a ceiling exhaust fan. Would this help?

A. You need some type of fan that exhausts directly to the outsideeither through the ceiling or the wallunless your building already has an exhaust system for the bathrooms. Even with an exhaust fan or built-in exahust ventscondensation on walls and ceilings is almost inevitable when taking a hot shower with the bathroom door closed.

As you can seethe small bag at the left has 24 ounces of popcorn and sells for $1.50 at the TierneyLab Multiplex. We have a couple of questions for you:

1) Quickly estimateby eyethe the amount of popcorn in each of the MediumLarge and Extra Large sizes. 2) How much would you be willing to pay for each of the MediumLarge and Extra Large sizes?

You can post your answers as a comment. (For each questionjust write down the numbersseparated by commasstarting with Medium and ending with Extra Large.) I’ll be discussing the researchers’ work here Tuesday. Later in the week I’ll discuss these popcorn bags and the results of the experiment. Andto show our appreciation for your contribution to sciencethe Lab judges will award one gift of gourmet popcorn — or some other treat if you don’t like popcorn at all — to a respondent chosen at random. (You can indicate your preferred brand of popcorn or other comestible.)

UPDATE [11:35 p.m.Monday]: We’ve just made some changes in the experimentand if you already participated earlier todayyou can do so again now. Please note in your comment if you already submitted answers earlier today.

 919,  2013, a, Mark Bittman on food and all things related.

Nothing affects public health in the United States more than food. Gun violence kills tens of thousands of Americans a year. Heart diseasecancerstroke and diabetes kill more than a million people a year — nearly half of all deaths — and diet is a root cause of many of those diseases.

And the root of that dangerous diet is our system of hyper-industrial agriculturethe kind that uses 10 times as much energy as it produces.

We must figure out a way to un-invent this food system. It’s been a major contributor to climate changespawned the obesity crisispoisoned countless volumes of land and waterwasted energytortured billions of animals… I could go on. The point is that “sustainability” is not only possible but essential: only by saving the earth can we save ourselvesand vice versa.

How do we do that?

This seems like a good day to step back a bit and suggest something that’s sometimes difficult to accept.

Patience.

We can only dismantle this system little by littleand slowly. Change takes time. Often — usually — that time exceeds the life span of its pioneers. And when it comes to sustainable food for billionswe’re the pioneers of a food movement that’s just beginning to take shape. The abolition movement began at least a century before the Civil War200 years before the civil rights movement. The struggle to gain the right to vote for women in the United States was active for 75 years before an amendment was passed. The gay rights struggle has made tremendous strides over the last 40 yearsbut equal treatment under the law is hardly established.

Well-cared-for animals will necessarily be more expensivewhich means we’ll eat fewer of them; that’s a win-win.

Activists who took on these issues had in common a clear series of demands and a sense that the work was ongoing. They had a large and ever-growing public following and a willingness to sacrifice timeenergy and even life for the benefit not only of contemporaries but for subsequent generations.

They were also aware that there is no success without a willingness to fail; that failure is a part of progress. A single defeat was seen as a temporary setback. The same vision should be applied to every issue the nascent food movement is tackling.

Yet before we can assess our progresswe must state our goals. There is no consensus behind a program for achieving sustainable production of food that promotes rather than attacks health. We can’t ask for “better food for all”; we must be specific. In the very near termfor examplewe must fight to protect and improve programs that make food available to lower-income Americans. We must also support the increasingly assertive battles of workers in food-related industries; nothing reflects our moral core more accurately than the abuses we overlook in the names of convenience and economy.

Beyond thatI believe that the two issues that will have the greatest reverberations in agriculturehealth and the environment are reducing the consumption of sugar-laden beverages and improving the living conditions of livestock.

About the first I have written plentyand can summarize: when we begin treating sugar-sweetened beverages as we do tobaccowe will make a huge stride in improving our diet.

The second is even more powerfuland progress was made in that arena in 2012 as one food company after another resolved to (eventually) reject pork produced with gestation crates. So over the next few yearssome animals will be treated somewhat better. This is absolutelyunquestionably thanks to public pressurewhich should now set its sights higher and insist that all animals grown for food production be treated not just better but well.

Well-cared-for animals will necessarily be more expensivewhich means we’ll eat fewer of them; that’s a win-win. They’ll use fewer antibioticsthey’ll be produced by more farmers in more placesand they’ll eat less commodity grainwhich will both reduce environmental damage and allow for more land to be used for high-quality human food like fruits and vegetables.

Allies may argue that I miss the mark with either or both of theseand that’s fine: it’s a discussion. The point is that no major food issue will be resolved in the next 10 years. As pioneerswe must build upon incremental progress and not be disheartenedbecause often there isn’t quick resolution for complex issues.

An association between tobacco and cancer was discovered more 200 years ago. The surgeon general’s report that identified smoking as a public health issue appeared in 1964. The food movement has not yet reached its 1964; there’s isn’t even a general acknowledgment of a problem in need of fixing.

Soin 2013let’s call for energyaction — and patience.

 5330,  1988, a, A jury decided today that British commandos acted within the law when they shot and killed three unarmed Irish Republican Army guerrillas in this British colony last March.

Critics of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Government have said the killings were part of an unofficial ''shoot to kill'' policy against members of the I.R.A. But the 11-member jury ruled that the commandos of the Special Air Service acted lawfully when they killed Daniel McCannSean Savage and Mairead Farrell on March 6 as the three walked toward the Spanish border. The jury's vote was 9 to 2.

After the verdictNyall Farrellthe brother of Miss Farrellsaid: ''This is a Pyrrhic victory for the Crown Counsel. There was a split decision.'' Michael Huckerlawyer for the solierscalled the ruling ''total vindication.'' Fear of Car Bomb

The commandos testified at the inquest that they believed that the three I.R.A. members were prepared to detonate a car bomb by remote controland that the three made threatening moves when confronted. The I.R.A. has acknowledged that the three were on ''active service,'' meaning they were on a mission to strike against a British targetat the time of their deaths.

 1680,  2009, a, After taking a tongue lashing from President ObamaChrysler’s holdout lenders got a show of support from The Financial Times’s John Gapper.

“Unlike Barack Obama and othersI have sympathy for the hedge funds and other investment funds that rejected the Chrysler restructuring offer and forced it into Chapter 11 bankruptcy,” Mr. Gapper wrote in a column titled “In defence of the Chrysler hedge funds.”

On ThursdayMr. Obama railed against the holdout lendersnow effectively a hostile group of business partnerswhom he called “speculators.”

“They were hoping that everybody else would make sacrificesand they would have to make none,” Mr. Obama said of the creditorsamong them several hedge funds and boutique investment funds. “I don’t stand with them.”

Most of the major debtholdersled by JPMorgan Chaseagreed to write down the debt owed to them by more than two-thirds. That put the onus on the remaining holdouts — including units of OppenheimerFundsXerion Capital Fund of Perella Weinberg Partners and Stairway Capital — which argued they were falling victim to the willingness of their big banking partners in Chrysler to play nice with a government that had helped bail them out as well. Perella Weinberg decided late Thursday that it would accept the government’s terms.

Administration officials said the holdouts’ position left them no option but to force Chrysler into bankruptcy.

“Wellyes,” Mr. Gapper wrote“except that some of these ‘speculators’ inconveniently manage money on behalf of pension plans and endowmentsrather than rapacious rich people. They have a fiduciary duty to get the best deal they can on behalf of their investors.”

“I also take seriously their point thatalthough they are higher up in the ranks of creditors than Chrysler’s unionsnotably the UAWthey were offered less for their investments,” Mr. Gapper added.

The secured lenderscontending that they are being unfairly blamed for sending the automaker into bankruptcy protectionsay that the Obama administration is skirting bankruptcy law by forcing them to take a larger loss on their debt than other Chrysler stakeholders.

The groupwhich is calling itself the Committee of Non-TARP Lenderssaid Thursday that it had been compelled to negotiate through a group of big banksincluding JPMorgan Chase and Citigroupthat have accepted government bailout money and so are reluctant to push back against the Treasury Department’s proposal. They claim the government has ignored their proposals to restructure Chrysler.

Mr. Gapper agreed with that assessmentwriting: “President Obama is trying to use the bully pulpit of the presidency to shove these investors into taking a worse deal than they could ordinarily expect under Chapter 11. The Tarp-funded banks that voted for the deal were no doubt aware of how they might be pilloried if they did not do so.”

Howevernot all industry watchers were feeling the love for the holdout lenders. The Washington Post’s Steven Pearlstein took them to task in a broad swipe at the hedge fund industry.

“There may be nothing more pathetic than a hedge-fund manager worked up in a moral lathercomplaining that he hasn’t been treated fairly. Since when did any of these guys ever worry about fairness?” Mr. Pearlstein wrote.

The columnist said he didn’t “recall receiving even a single e-mail from a hedge-fund manager complaining about how unfair it was that the government stepped in to bail out creditors and counterparties of CitigroupBear Stearns and AIG.”

In an editorial on the Chrysler bankruptcyThe New York Times said that by pushing the matter into bankruptcy courtthe administration was assuming that the judge would also reject the holdouts’ demands.

“There are reasons to hope it will work out that way. In particulara judge may be unwilling to favor the dissident bondholders when other significant stakeholders have been able to come to agreement outside of court,” The New York Times said.

Bankruptcy always contains some element of unpredictabilityand the minority of debtholders who oppose the new arrangement could argue in court that the company is worth more to them in liquidation. Mr. Gapper argued that the holdout creditors may even “have a better chance of getting improved terms from the bankruptcy court than the US administration would have us believe.”

 3827,  1997, a, The last five years have been precarious ones for Doris Dillems's New Friends Place nursery school and day care center at 130 Greene Street. Rent increases and legal fees racked up in her struggle to hold on to her ground-floor space have helped to drain her resources. This monthshe must leave the space where for the last 18 years she has operated one of the few day care centers in SoHo. The landlord wants to sell itand she says she cannot afford to stay in the area. ''I'm going under unless I get some help,'' she said.

Already because of the uncertaintysome of the parents of children in New Friends are reluctantly making other arrangements. ''It's a huge hardship for parents and for the kids,'' said Faye Ran-Moseleya 25-year-resident of SoHo and teacher at Audrey Cohen Collegewho is looking into alternative plans for her 3-year-old daughter. ''For a working motherthese things are the foundations of your life.''

Other past and present clients say Ms. Dillems has molded the day care centerwhich serves up to 40 childrenages 2 through 5to suit the sometimes erratic SoHo artist's schedule. ''She loves artistsand she responds to their way of life,'' said Tsipi Ben-Haimdirector of City Artsa SoHo-based nonprofit arts education groupwhose son went to New Friends.

The auction is scheduled to be held at 139 Greene Streetat Space Untitledfrom Thursday to June 10.

 538,  2016, a, As Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration moves forward on plans for a new streetcar line from Queens to Brooklyncity officials on Tuesday unveiled the different routes they are considering for the project.

The $2.5 billion waterfront streetcar would run on streets in some of New York City’s most popular and crowded neighborhoods along the East Riverincluding Williamsburg and Downtown Brooklyn. City officials plan to discuss the routes at community meetings over the next two months before selecting a path early next year.

Mr. de Blasio proposed the streetcarknown as the Brooklyn Queens Connectorin Februaryand now New Yorkers can see where exactly it might run and the potential impact on their neighborhoods. The streetcar linewhich would travel about 16 miles from Astoria in Queens to Sunset Park in Brooklynis the mayor’s most high-profile transportation priority and could open by 2024.

In a 25-page report on the routescity officials outlined the benefits and drawbacks of using certain streets in each neighborhoodincluding the width of the road and how close the street is to subway lines for riders who want to transfer. Maps also show how the streetcar could travel over bridges to cross Newtown Creek and the Gowanus Canal — a potentially expensive part of the plan if new bridges are built.

 3425,  1999, a, Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.

Overview of Lesson Plan: Students investigate examples of hate crimes and their causes by participating in a round-table discussion. Students will also write a personal essay describing their personal views on the subject and describing a plan for putting their views into action.



Author(s):

Alison ZimbalistThe New York Times Learning Network

Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Express their impressions of the causes of hate crimes.

2. Examine examples of hate crimessociety’s perception of hate crimesand the possibility that these types of crimes are on the rise by reading and discussing the Op-Ed article“Staring at Hatred.”

3. Write a personal essay expressing their personal views about hate crimes and intolerance and describing a plan for putting their views into action.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/ pencils

-classroom blackboard

-copies of “Staring at Hatred” (one per student)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/ DO-NOW: In their journalsstudents respond to the following questions (written on the board prior to class): “What is a hate crimeand why do you think hate crimes occur?” Students then share their responsesand the teacher makes a list on the board of the “reasons” for hate crimes offered by students.

2. Read and discuss “Staring at Hatred,” focusing on the following questions:

a. What crime did John William King commit?

b. What other examples of hate crimes does the author describe? Who were the victims of these crimesand who committed them? What “reasons” were given for committing these crimes?

c. What is the conclusion reached by the Southern Poverty Law Center about incidents of hate crimes?

d. According to Morris Deeschief trial counsel of the Southern Povery Law Centerwhat is fueling the hatred that leads to hate crimes?

e. Are the victims of hate crimes and those who commit them restricted to a particular group of people? Give examples to support your answer.

f. Do you agree with the statement“The desire to turn away from a crime as grotesque as the murder of James Byrd in JasperTex.is understandable”? What reason does the author give for this attitude?

g. Why do you think “some sense of warped superiorityor inadequacyor fear” might lead someone to commit a hate crime?

h. Based on the final paragraph of the articlewhat is the author’s opinion about what needs to be done in order to stop hate crimes?

3. In round-table discussion formatconsider these questions:

–What are the causes of hate crimes?

–What can weas a society and as individualsdo to reduce hate crimes?

To keep the discussion flowing in an orderly manner and to decrease any personal attacks that may occur over such a heated issuethe teacher may want to keep a “stack” of the names of students who wish to contribute to the discussion. Students who wish to speak can have their names added to the list by raising their handsand names are added to the bottom of the list to maintain the order in which students volunteer to speak. Establish ground rules that prohibit personal attacksraised voicesand disrespectful language in order to encourage a free-flowingcandid discussion.

4. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: Students write a personal essay expressing their personal views about hate crimes. The essay should include an action plan that describes how individuals and social institutions (including schoolschurchesand localstateand national governments) can acknowledge and address the causes of hate crimes.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–What is a hate crime? How is a hate crime different from other crimes?

–What is the relationship between hate crimes and attitudes of prejudice and intolerance?

–Where do individuals learn attitudes of prejudiceintoleranceand hatred?

–What are the definitions of racismanti-Semitismand homophobia?

–Are there examples of hate crimes that have been committed in our community? If sowho was/were the victim(s) and who committed the crime(s). In each casewhy would you describe this as a hate crime? How did the community respond to each crime?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on written journal responseparticipation in class discussionsand written personal essay and action plan.

Vocabulary:

Extension Activities:

1. Research laws that deal with hate crimes on the localstateand federal levels. For each lawinvestigate specific examples of how that law has been enacted in the United States.

2. Organize a debate on this topic: Hate groups should not enjoy the right of free speech as guaranteed by the First Amendment as individuals and groups that promote less controversial beliefs.

3. Find news articles about the murder of James Byrd Jr. and the trial and conviction of John William King and compare them to this op-ed article. How do these different types of newspaper writing present ideas differently?

4. Learn about the history and work of the Southern Poverty Law Center and present your findings to the class. (Address: Southern Poverty Law Center400 Washington AvenueMontgomeryAL 36104; online at (//www.splcenter.org/)

5. Read a novel or other book on the subject of racialreligiousor other type of prejudice or hatred and discuss it with the class. (Suggestions: To Kill a MockingbirdBlack BoyThe Summer of My German SoldierThe Diary of Anne Frank.)

6. Write a children’s book that contains a lesson about tolerance.

7. Write slogans and create posters to encourage tolerance and understanding and discourage prejudice and hatred.

8. Note: This activity is suitable for older students and will require careful monitoring by the teacher. Review the literature and/or Web sites of hate groups and analyze their messages and tactics. Write a letter to one of these groups expressing your opinion about their beliefs.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Research historic examples of Supreme Court cases dealing with discrimination based on racereligiongenderor sexual preference.

Global History- Investigate legislation in other countries that addresses the issue of discrimination.

Teaching with The Times- Find articles in various sections of The New York Times that deal with the murder of James Byrd Jr.other cases described in the featured articleor other examples of hate crimes and the activities of hate groups.

She cites numerous instances in which there is evidence that heredity dictates the traits of individuals - including quite minor traits - but she reports that on such fundamental issues as a person's ''niceness'' or the tendency to ''criminality'' heredity does not seem very important. This would seem to call into question many of her subtler findings. WILLIAM E. STONEMAN BelmontMass.

Dan Shefet doesn’t want you to Google his name.

A Danish lawyer who has lived in Paris for 30 yearsMr. Shefet has been accused online of professional malpracticefraud and even having connections to the Serbian mafia — accusations he strongly denies.

“It’s been nightmarish. It’s affected my entire family,” Mr. Shefet60said at his somewhat cluttered office in central Paris. “As a lawyerI live and die by my reputation.”

So in 2013Mr. Shefet asked Google to take down links to the defamatory material. The search engine compliedbut only on its French sitemeaning anyone outside France could still see the items in question.

Then last yearafter Europe’s highest court ruled that anyone with connections to Europe could ask that links about themselves be removed from search resultsMr. Shefet took a different approach.

He sued Google’s French unit — citing the so-called right-to-be-forgotten decision — and asked a Paris court to force the company to remove the links not just in France but in all of the company’s global search engine domains.

And he won — perhaps setting a precedent that the European ruling should apply far more broadly than originally understood.

In the judgment for Mr. Shefetthe French judge relied on a specific point of the recent privacy ruling that said a company’s local subsidiary could be held liable for the activities of its parent. The judge ordered Google’s French subsidiary to pay daily fines of roughly $1,100 until links to the defamatory content were removed from all searches worldwide.

“Google put up a hell of a fight. But they lost,” Mr. Shefet said. “Now if Google doesn’t complythey will be fined.”

Google says it has already removed the defamatory links from its search results in Europeand it argues that the Paris court’s decision does not specifically demand that the company’s non-European domains must comply with the judgment. Although Google is being finedno payments have been made.

StillMr. Shefet’s case has raised a central question about Europe’s data protections rules: How far can the Continent impose its own strict privacy laws on sites that operate outside Europeincluding those of GoogleMicrosoft and Facebook?

The ability for Europe to enforce the region’s privacy rules beyond its borders will be a major part of a report soon to be published by a committee set up by Google. The reportexpected to be released by mid-Februarywill counsel the company on how to handle Europe’s right-to-be-forgotten standard. The company has complied with roughly 40 percent of the 760,000 link-removal requests that it has received over the last eight monthsaccording to the company’s latest transparency report.

The advisory group includes Jimmy Walesthe founder of Wikipediawho has been a vocal opponent of the European privacy decisionas well as a number of leading data protection academics.

But after holding a number of public meetings across Europethe committee remains divided over whether Google should impose the right-to-be-forgotten decision on all of its global search resultsaccording to several people with direct knowledge of the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because the report had yet to be completed.

Despite the differing viewshoweverthe majority of the group is expected to recommend that Europe’s standard should only apply within the 28-country blocaccording to one of the people. That would support Google’s efforts to limit the privacy decision so that its search results outside the European Union would remain unaffected.

“It’s our strong view that there needs to be some way of limiting the concept because it is a European concept,” Google’s top lawyerDavid Drummondtold an audience in Brussels in Januaryreferring to the right-to-be-forgotten ruling. “We’ve had a basic approach. We’ve followed it; on this question we’ve made removals Europewidebut not beyond.”

Google’s position has put it at odds with many of Europe’s privacy watchdogswhich are concerned that people — both inside and outside Europe — can sidestep the region’s stringent privacy rules simply by using a non-European web address. While links on European sites like Google.fr and Google.de may be removedfor exampleother domains like Google.com would not be affected.

AlreadyEuropean regulators have issued guidelines calling on Google to apply the right-to-be-forgotten ruling to its entire search empire.

And as people like Mr. Shefet increasingly take Google and others to court to force them to remove links from global search resultsthe battle over whether people have the right to be forgotten online is set to intensify.

“The European court’s judgment will have profound consequences,” said Mr. Shefetwho now advises others on how to demand that links to content be removed worldwide. “The floodgates have opened.”

 4696,  1992, a, Three years after a pregnant Carol Stuart was murderedapparently by her husbandCharleswho the police believe committed suicide soon afterwardMr. Stuart's brother is scheduled to go on trial Monday for his role in the crime.

Matthew Stuart26 years oldhas not been charged as an accomplice to the murder. He is accused of conspiring with his brother to commit life insurance frauda scheme that prosecutors say led to Mrs. Stuart's slaying. He is also charged with related crimes.

But Mr. Stuart's lawyerNancy Gertnerhas argued in pretrial hearings that her client is really being tried "for the sins of his brother." And she has charged that the prosecution of Mr. Stuart is largely politicalthat it is intended to make up for bungling by the police and the Suffolk County District Attorney's office in the initial investigation.

Based on Charles Stuart's account of the crimethe police named a black man as a suspectstirring racial tension. Mrs. Stuart was shot and her husband badly wounded shortly after the couple left a child birthing class on Oct. 231989. Mr. Stuart said a black man had committed the crime.

 1705,  2009, a, While the future of the North American operations of General Motors is in the hands of a federal bankruptcy judgeOpel and the rest of G.M.’s European business escaped that fate with help from the German government as well as Magna Internationalthe Canadian-Austrian auto parts maker set to acquire OpelNelson D. Schwartz of The New York Times reports from Paris.

The German governmentunder heavy political pressure in an election year to save nearly 25,000 Opel jobs in Germanybrokered a deal over the weekend for an alliance led by Magna and the Russian bank Sberbank to acquire Opel and to provide 1.5 billion eurosor $2.1 billionin bridge financing.

As a resultG.M.’s European operationswhich include Opelas well as Vauxhalla venerable British brandwere not included in the American filing.

“With the financingeven with the G.M. actions in the U.S.we can now confidently say to our employeescustomerssuppliers and dealers that it’s business as usual as we go through the process of creating a newmore independent Opel-Vauxhall,” said Carl-Peter Forsterthe president of G.M. Europe. Mr. Forster will run the new companyto be known as Adam Opel.

Howevernon-German workers fear they could pay a huge price for Berlin’s role in providing crucial financing. As part of the dealMagna is expected to try to keep German job losses downwhich has set off complaints by union leaders in Britain and Belgium that local G.M. workers will bear the brunt of any layoffs.

More than 2,000 workers are employed at a G.M. plant in Antwerp that G.M. has long sought to closeas well as nearly 5,000 in Britain.

But Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britainwho must call for elections by the end of 2010also vowed to protect G.M. workers at home.

“We are determined to save as many of the Vauxhall jobs as possible,” Mr. Brown told Sky News.

The tensions over the issue of protecting local workers versus sticking with the single market vision of the 27-member European Union are likely to continue even after the Magna deal for Opel is completed. France has also sought to safeguard auto jobs at homeinfuriating newer members of the European Union in Central Europe that are home to auto plants.

Risking billions in loan guarantees and other aid for a single company has also stirred criticism. On Sundaythe German economy ministerKarl-Theodor zu Guttenberg offered his resignation and warned in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that the “concept is not without risks for the state and the guarantees it has promised for Opel.”

 973,  2013, a, Thirteen opera companies across the United States will share $300,000 in grants awarded by Opera America in the first year of its new Building Opera Audiences program. The grantswhich range from $7,500 to $30,000are for programs meant to increase first-time opera attendanceand to increase return visits.

In particularthe organization was looking for projects that used technology and social mediaoffered special events in community theatersor sought to engage listeners in discussions about perceived barriers to enjoying opera. The winners were selected from a pool of 67 companies that applied for the grants. The grants are underwritten by the Ann and Gordon Getty Foundation.

The projects to receive the financial aid offer a variety of approaches to building an audience. Opera on the Jamesin LynchburgVa.will use its funding for “Get Real,” a project that includes a short mixed-genre opera (also called “Get Real”) as a way of introducing young urban listeners to the formas well as excerpts from standard repertory operas in new orchestrationswith hip-hop rhythmsspoken word and video.

American Opera Projectsa Brooklyn company that focuses on contemporary workswill create a mobile app called “Have a Voice,” which will allow the company’s audiences – and those of several other participating organizations – to offer feedback to creative artistsas well as opportunities for discounts and prizes (including tickets).

The Arizona Opera won its grant for a program meant to find opera fans in the Hispanic communityby way of school programs and a Spanish marketing program in Tucson and Phoenix. The Los Angeles Opera’s “Newcomer Project” offers preparatory materials and discounted tickets in the hope of demystifying the opera experience – something that the Florentine Opera Companyin Milwaukeealso plans to do through its Bohème Societywhich will offer film screeningsbackstage tours and receptions to new listeners.

The other companies that won grants are the Madison OperaOpera Memphisthe Opera Theater of Pittsburghthe San Francisco Operathe Sarasota Operathe Seattle Operathe Syracuse Opera and the Vancouver Opera. Opera America plans to monitor and evaluate the projectsand to share its findings with companies in the organization.

-copies of journalist codes of ethicsfound online at //www.asne.org/ideas/codes/codes.htm

-resources about journalism ethics and laws relating to journalism (civics and journalism textbooksencyclopediascomputers with Internet accessetc.)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journalsstudents respond to the following prompt (written on the board prior to class): “The First Amendment of the United States Constitution states that ‘Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speechor of the press.’ What does this mean? What is the significance of a free press in a democratic society?” After a few minutesallow students time to share their answers. As a classbrainstorm a list of situationsactions or events where freedom of the press may be attacked or restricted due to other compelling interests. (The annotated text of the First Amendment is available from the FindLaw Web site at //caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment01/.)

Explain to students that they will now read an article about a current legal case in which two reportersone for Time magazine and the other for The New York Timesare being legally compelled to turn over their notes regarding a confidential source. (Background information about the case involving Matthew Cooper and Judith Millerknown as the Valerie Plame investigationcan be found online at the Web site for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press at //www.rcfp.org/shields_and_subpoenas.html#plame.)

2. As a classread and discuss the article “Time Inc. Decides to Hand Over Notes of Reporter Facing Prison” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050701friday.html)focusing on the following questions:

a. What decision did Time magazine announce?

b. Why is it big news for a media organization to reveal a confidential source? What legal consequences are the two reporters facing?

c. Who is Norman Pearlstineand why did he decide to hand in the documents?

d. According to the articlewhy is the case significant?

e. Why has the press “traditionally argued that it needs confidential sources”?

f. What is the position of Time’s reporterMatthew Cooperabout Mr. Pearlstine’s decision? What documents are being handed over to the special prosecutor?

g. How might Mr. Pearlstine’s actions affect Mr. Cooper? How might it they affect the situation of Judith Millerthe New York Times reporter?

i. What was the 1978 incident involving The New York Times? What position did the newspaper and reporter Myron Farber take in that case?

j. What does Zachary W. Carter mean by “civil disobedience”?

k. According to Mr. Carter and James C. Goodalehow are the risks taken by an individual reporter different from risks taken by a company?

l. What are the key points in this case? Who are the other reporters involved?

m. According to the articlewhat events in addition to the Plame case have created challenges for the news media?

3. Divide students into six groups. Provide each group with copies of codes of ethics from various media organizationssuch as the American Society of Newspaper Editorsthe National Press Photographers Association and the Radio-Television News Directors Association. Codes of ethics for these and other organizations can be found at //www.asne.org/ideas/codes/codes.htm. Explain that they will be briefly examining these codes of ethics to prepare for a fishbowl discussion on journalism ethics.

After a few minutesask students to share what elements stood out from these codes. Write key words and ideas on the board for reference.

Thenexplain to the class that they will be participating in a “fishbowl” discussion on journalism ethics. Firstask students to number off one to fiveand then keep a list on the board of all “1’s,” “2’s,” “3’s,” “4’s,” and “5’s.” Ask all “1’s” to sit facing one another in the middle of a circle created by the rest of the students. The students in the center are the only ones allowed to speak. If a student from the outer circle wants to add to the discussionhe or she moves to the middle of the circletaps a participant to indicate that he or she should resume a place in the outer circleand takes that student’s place as the new person in the discussion. After discussing the first questionswitch the students in the center to all “2’s,” and allow the same fishbowl procedure to occur. Be sure to switch topics enough times so that all students have the opportunity to be in the center of the discussion at least once.

Questions to pose to students include:

-What is the role of the media in a democratic society?

-Jail is often viewed as a deterrent of crimes or a corrective measure to prevent repeated crimes. Is jail an appropriate punishment for a journalist who refuses to reveal sources? Why or why not?

-What are the dangers of limiting the freedoms journalists are entitled to when gathering information?

-Do individual reporters and media companies have similar or different responsibilities to readers? To the law? To company shareholders? To the ethics of their profession?

-Which is more importantthe public’s right to know or the judicial system’s need for information? Why?

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individuallystudents write reaction papers responding to the following taskcopied into a handout for easier student access: “Read the following statementstaken from the article read during class. Write a 1-2 page paper responding to one or more of the following quotations. In addition to commenting on this opinionprovide your own feelings about Time magazine’s decision to provide documents revealing confidential sources to a grand jury. Do you agree with this decision? Why or why not? Based on your reading and discussion in classhow might this decision affect the actions of journalists and media organizations in the short term and in the future? How might it affect you as a news consumer?”

QUOTATIONS

-Norman Pearlstineeditor in chief of TimeInc.: “‘I found myself really coming to the conclusion,’ he said‘that once the Supreme Court has spoken in a case involving national security and a grand jurywe are not above the law and we have to behave the way ordinary citizens do.'”

-Arthur Sulzberger Jr.publisher of The New York Times: “‘We are deeply disappointed by Time Inc.’s decision to deliver the subpoenaed records,’ he said. ‘We faced similar pressures in 1978 when both our reporter Myron Farber and The Times Company were held in contempt of court for refusing to provide the names of confidential sources. Mr. Farber served 40 days in jail and we were forced to pay significant fines.'”

-Zachary W. Cartera former United States attorney in Brooklyn: “‘I don’t believe that a company has the right to put the assets of it shareholders at risk in an act of civil disobedience,’ he said. ‘On the other handthe reporters are only faced with the consequences to them personally. They have the absolute right to put their liberty and fortunes at risk.'”

-James C. Goodalea former general counsel of The Times Company and an authority on legal protections for reporters: “‘A public company must protect its assets even if that means going into contempt,’ he said. ‘It has an obligation under the First Amendment to protect those assetsand it’s in the interest of shareholders to protect those assets.'”

Students may share their response papers in a future class.

Further Questions for Discussion:

-Why might a reporter use an anonymous source?

-What other professions have ethical codes?

-How is an ethical code different from judicial laws?

-What characterizes fair and honest reporting?

-In the case of anonymous sourcesis a journalist or media organization that refuses to reveal sources acting “above the law”?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on completion of initial journal responsesparticipation in class and group discussionsthoughtful participation in fishbowl discussion and well-explained response papers.

Extension Activities:

1. Research and write a briefing paper outlining the Watergate scandal and the role journalism ethics played in the reporting about it. What stance did Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward take regarding their sources? What stance did their editorBen Bradleeand their employerThe Washington Posttake? How did the Supreme Court respond?

2. Write a reaction paper examining why journalistsunlike other professionalsrequire a code of ethics that allows for the use of anonymous sources. Is there any other industry or field that legally uses anonymous sources?

3. Create a pamphlet explaining how to begin a career in journalism. What type of schooling or training is necessary? Where can a person gain experience? What options are there within the field of journalism? Who are some famous journalists in each field? Why are they notable?

4. Read “Red LightGreen Light: A Plea for Balance in Media Ethics” by Roy Peter Clark (//www.poynter.org/content/content_view.asp?id=82553&sid=32)paying close attention to his “Red Light” and “Green Light” ethics lists. Write a position paper either supporting or opposing Mr. Clark’s opinion about how current affairs have impacted journalism ethics. Besides agreeing or disagreeingdiscuss the dangers of limiting (or not limiting) the media and work tactics of journalists.

5. The Supreme Court case Branzburg v. Hayes (1972) examines whether news reporters being required to appear and testify before state or federal grand juries constitutes an abridgement of the freedoms of speech and press as guaranteed by the First Amendment.

6. Conduct a debate on whether or not it is the responsibility of a news organization to protect its reporters in situations such as the one involving Mr. Cooper and Ms. Miller. Consider the stance of Time Inc.as well as The New York Times.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Fine Arts – Create a poster illustrating the value of anonymous sources to American journalists.

Global History

-Research journalism ethics in various countries. Keep in mind that the type of government a nation has affects the way the media is run. Consider the media in non-democratic countriessuch as CubaChinaVietnamNorth KoreaIranthe former Soviet Unionetc. Prepare a chart illustrating the names of the countriestypes of governmentnumber of legal media outletslaws applicable to the mediaetc.

-Prepare an oral presentation examining civil disobedience. What forms does it take? What famous acts of civil disobedience have occurred throughout world history? What impact did each event have?

Teaching with The Times

-Continue to read articles relating to the case against Matthew Cooper and Judith Miller. Clip headlines and key paragraphs and compile them into a news ethics journal. For each clippingwrite a brief summary of the article and you reaction to the events in this story.

-Read and clip “The Ethicist” column by Randy Cohen in the Sunday New York Times Magazine for a monthand respond to Mr. Cohen about one or more of his decisions. To order The New York Times for your classroomclick here.

Technology – Create a Web site that explains basic journalism ethics and provides a list of Internet resources for further reference. Ask your school librarian to feature this site on your school’s Web siteif possible.

 4194,  1995, a, A totally new screen design begins with a desktop even less useful than the one on the Macwhose iconsfolders and document orientation have been "borrowed," lockstock and subdirectory. Desktop icons let you explore files on My Computer and in the Network Neighborhood. You can also click on a Recycle Binwhere deleted files are stored until you empty them; a Briefcasewhich lets you pack files for travel; an electronic Inboxwhich stores your mail and faxesandunless the Justice Department intervenesthe Microsoft Network on-line service.

The Start button at the bottom left of the screen launches a list of programs and documents. A Taskbar beside it shows what programs are currently running and is supposed to be visible at all times. But in just one of many maddening inconsistenciesmultimedia programs often make the Taskbar mysteriously disappear.

User interfaces are highly personal. I found this one an improvement over Windows 3.1 but persistently irritating nonetheless. How do you call up a directory of your files? Click My Computer or Windows Explorerwhich work quite differently from one another. There are many disparate ways to do things as simple as copying a filebut none works quite the way you expect it toat least not until you discover the formerly dormant right mouse button. Where is the Shut Down option? On the Start buttonof course!

You get used to these oddities. Windows 95 lets you customize look and feel to a fare-thee-well and adds useful features like a "find" utilitywhich helps track down files across multiple drives and directories. But unlike OS/2 Warpthe system can get befuddled if you delete or rename certain files.

As noted here on June 20Windows 95 lets you use long file names like Letter to an Unknown Womanbut also truncates them into old-style "8-dot-3" directory entries like LETTER 1.DOC. The ability to use long file namesavailable on the Mac since 1984is long overdue; unfortunatelycurrent application software cannot view or manipulate themand sending them across networks or to DOS or Windows 3.1 systems adds special problems. You cannot avoid them even if you want to: Windows 95 stores many of its own files under the new scheme.

Programs like Quicken and Turbotax handle few user-named files. But with most programsthe right but costly answer to the long-file-name perplex is to buy new software designed for Windows 95. Upgraded utility software is crucial. Current backup softwarefor examplecannot save long file namesand the inadequate Windows 95 backup program crashed repeatedly on my system.

Early tests of final versions here and in the July 24 issue of PC Week confirm that Windows 95 does not run current programs faster; if anythingit tends to slow them down a bit. In actual usepluses and minuses seem randomly mixed. On my systemmultimedia benchmark programs indicated significantly improved CD-ROM performancebut loading Encarta took nearly twice as long as it did before.

 1215,  2012, a, The Republican National Convention in TampaFla. received mediocre television ratings — and the polling data so far suggests that it may produce only a modest bounce in the polls for Mitt Romney.

The most favorable number for Mr. Romney is from the Rasmussen Reports tracking poll. That survey showed him pulling into a 3-point lead against President Obama on Saturday. All of the interviews in the Rasmussen poll were conducted after the convention beganalthough only about one-third were conducted after Mr. Romney’s acceptance speech on Thursday night.

The Rasmussen poll represents a 5-point swing toward Mr. Romney from the polling firm’s final survey before the conventionswhen it had Mr. Obama ahead by two points. But it does not read quite as strongly for him as compared to the long-term average of Rasmussen pollswhich have had Mr. Romney ahead by about one percentage point on average over the past 60 days.



Another surveyan online tracking poll conducted by the polling firm Ipsoshad previously shown a decent-sized bounce for Mr. Romney — but it has since receded some. In the version of the poll that Ipsos released on SaturdayMr. Obama led by one percentage point44-43among likely voters. That’s a better result for Mr. Romney than the survey the firm conducted prior to the conventionswhen Mr. Romney had trailed by four points. But it reflects a reversal from Thursdaywhen Mr. Romney was up by two points in the poll.

The most sluggish of the tracking polls is from Gallupwhich reports its results over a lengthy seven-day window. That means that only about half its interviews occurred after the start of the conventionand a smaller fraction than that will represent people surveyed after Mr. Romney’s acceptance address.

Howeverthe trend so far in the Gallup poll is a bit disappointing for Mr. Romney; the survey still shows Mr. Obama one point ahead. By comparisonthe Gallup poll has had a 46-46 tie on average over the past 60 days.

We’ll need to wait another day or two before we can make a more confident judgement on the size of Mr. Romney’s bouncebut the information we have so far points toward its being a little underwhelming.

The FiveThirtyEight “now-cast”which does not adjust for the bounces associated with the party conventionsestimates that Mr. Obama would have a 72.3 percent chance of winning if the election were held today. That’s essentially unchanged from before the conventionswhen the number had ranged between about 70 percent and 74 percent.

One way to interpret the trend in the “now-cast” is thatso farMr. Romney’s bounce is hard to distinguish from the statistical noise that we ordinarily see in polls. Based on the data that they published on SaturdayMr. Romney’s standing in the Rasmussen poll was two points better than its 60-day averagebut it was one point worse than average in the Gallup poll.

The FiveThirtyEight forecastwhich penalizes a candidate in its evaluation of polls conducted just after his party conventioninterprets the data as being slightly negative for Mr. Romney. On SaturdayMr. Obama’s chances of winning the Electoral College rose to 73.1 percent in the forecastits highest figure since Aug. 16when it was 73.6 percent.

But whatever assumptions you make about a convention bounceit introduces more noise into the polling. Both the forecast and the “now-cast” are therefore likely to be more unstable than usual over the next week or twoand they should be interpreted with plenty of caution.

If Mr. Romney’s bounce turns out to be mediocrethe pressure will then be on Mr. Obama. If the polls fail to move much in his direction after the Democratic convention in CharlotteN.C.the gains he has made in the FiveThirtyEight forecast over the past few days will be reversed.
 5030,  1990, a, "Berlin is on the razor's edge," Mr. Kolhoff said. "It can be a great metropolisor it can be a poverty zone. Both are possible."

But the other argument is over the symbolism and the political effects of the move. For most GermansBerlin stands for recovery and reconstruction and the defiance of the Soviet attempt to starve the city out of its freedom with the 1948 blockade. Berlin also recalls the flight to freedom of millions of East Germans that provoked construction of the Berlin wall.

But from a historical perspectiveit also stands for Prussian militarism and failed empiresand the failed democracy of the Weimar period with the hyperinflationdisorder and decadence out of which Nazism arose.

"Many Germans never liked Berlin," said Joachim Trenknera television producer who has seen Berlin through thick and thin. "They regard it a little the way the rest of America sees New York. Basically an evil placeeven if lively and interesting. They go there to amuse themselvesbut they don't really like it or trust it." The Political Element

Partlythis is politicalhe admits. Berlin is run by a coalition of Social Democrats and a leftist grouping called the Alternative List that is often at loggerheads with the conservative Bonn Government. When Chancellor Helmut Kohl rushed to Berlin last November at the opening of the wallthe excited crowds booed him.

There is a strong anarchic sceneand the city is perceived by many in the west as overrun by foreigners. Polish moonlighters and Soviet Jewish immigrants aboundand a large Turkish population remains from the effort to hire workers from Turkey to offset a labor drain caused when working-class families fled the city's isolation after the wall went up. Now the crumbling Kreuzberg district is sometimes called Little IstanbulTurkish newspapers are edited here and there are two Turkish television stations.

Boosters of Berlin like Mr. Kolhoff like to point to surveys like one taken recently in what used to be East Germany showing that 87 percent of the population there favor Berlin as capital. But there are dissenters.

 6221,  1973, a, DETROITDec. 31 (AP)— Mickey Redmond's 20th goal of the season earned the Detroit Red Wings a 4‐4 tie with the Minnesota North Stars in the National Hockey League tonight. It was the Wings’ third tie of the week.

Redmond's goalat 6 minutes 23 seconds of the final periodgave the 25‐year‐old wing his fourth consecutive 20‐goal season in a six‐year career.

Gump’ Worlsey made his first start as goalie for Minnesota after 5½ weeks on the bench because of a pulled hamstring. He has lost only once this year in 10 games.

The Stars took an early lead on a goal by Danny Grant. But Detroit scored three straight goals in less than eight mintues to take a 3‐1 lead.

 3008,  2002, a, THEY may be wearing pinstriped uniformsbut five of the nine Yankees in tonight's batting order still have to prove they're Yankees.

And you can prove you're a Yankee only by winning the World Series.

Anything lessas George Steinbrenner would be the first to tell youmeans you've failed to do what has been done by so many proven Yankeeswho Joe Torre called ''my guys'' -- earn four World Series rings in five years and come within the ninth inning of another ring a year ago.

Many of Torre's guys are still here: Derek Jeter at shortstopBernie Williams in center fieldJorge Posada catchingand several pitchersnotably Roger ClemensAndy PettitteDavid WellsOrlando Hernández and Mariano Rivera. And even without a World Series ringsecond baseman Alfonso Soriano has shown he's a Yankee.

But the Yankees' success this month figures to turn on those new guys.

Of the five new postseason Yankees in tonight's opener of the American League division series against the Anaheim Angelsfirst baseman Jason Giambi and third baseman Robin Ventura don't need to be introduced. But will they be as productive in the postseason as Tino Martinez and Scott Brosius were?

 2880,  2002, a, More than 50 Special Operations troops have been active in the cave-riddled mountains of Tora Boranear Jalalabad. Some have been working with anti-Taliban Afghan militiaswho are searching through the caves for die-hard Al Qaeda members and intelligence documents. Other Americansincluding commandos and snipershave operated independently in their hunt for Al Qaeda warriors trying to escape into Pakistan.

It was unclear which Americans were attacked today.

In KandaharMr. Shirzai had been planning to send thousands of soldiers to begin a military campaign against the Taliban holdouts. But the plan was placed on hold late Sunday when Taliban commanders offered to surrendersaid Yusuf Pashtuna senior aide to Mr. Shirzai.

''We have now canceled that plan,'' Mr. Pashtun said this morningminutes before he left Kandahar for Helmand in a convoy that included the six American vehicles. The convoy stopped briefly in front of the house of Ahmed Karzaithe brother and chief spokesman for Hamid Karzaithe leader of Afghanistan's interim government.

Afghan commanders said the Taliban had been given until Thursday to fulfill their surrender agreement.

Sher Muhammadthe governor of Helmandwho was in Kandahar this morningsaid a force of Afghan soldiers and the American Special Forces troops were going to the towns of Musa Qala and Kajakijust south of Baghran. The Taliban were expected to surrender their weapons and vehicles in those townsbefore being allowed to return to their villagesMr. Muhammad said.

Mr. Muhammad said the Taliban there are being led by a commander from the area named Abdul Waheedbut better known as Rais Baghran. Mr. Muhammad added that the Taliban commander had insisted that Mullah Omar was not in Baghranan assertion that some anti-Taliban commanders seemed willing to believe.

But Muhammad Zalianother senior commander for Mr. Shirzaisaid the Taliban officials might be lying and buying time to allow Mullah Omar to escape. ''They will say anything,'' Mr. Zali said. ''We cannot trust them. We have to search all the areas in Baghran to make sure Mullah Muhammad Omar is not there.''

 4788,  1991, a, The United Nations Secretary General recommended today that the Baghdad Government pay up to 30 percent of its annual oil revenue as reparations for the invasion of Kuwait and the Persian Gulf war.

Iraq agreed to pay reparations out of current oil revenues as part of the terms of the gulf war cease-fire. But in a letter this month to Secretary General Javier Perez de CuellarBaghdad asked for a five-year moratorium on reparations payments to give it time to rebuild its shattered economy. That request is under study by the United Nations Compensation Fundwhich received the Secretary General's recommendation and will determine what the actual payment level will be.

Iraq has not been permitted to resume oil exports since the end of the warpending United Nations certification of its compliance with other sections of the cease-fire agreement.

A reparations figure of 20 to 30 percent of oil revenues had been widely expectedeven though the United States had called for a ceiling of as much as 50 percent. It was assumed that the American figure was a negotiating stance to offset figures as low as 5 percent proposed by Security Council members sympathetic to Iraq like Cuba. Ceiling Set by OPEC

 4435,  1993, a, The Rangers have struggled through more than two months without top defenseman Brian Leetchwho is recovering from damage to nerves in his neck and left shoulder. Jan ErixonDarren TurcotteJames PatrickJay WellsMike HurlbutSergei Zubov and Kevin Lowe are sidelined by or struggling with injuriesand Phil Bourque and Randy Gilhen returned to action on this trip after missing two weeks apiece with sore knees.

Doctors here originally feared that one of Messier's ribs had punctured one of his lungswhich would have kept him out of the lineup for at least six weeks. But the possibility that one of his ribs was broken was ruled out after he underwent X-rays and an examination at an Edmonton hospital Saturday night. According to Messierdoctors suspected that one of his right ribs popped out of place and then reset itself.

Messier planned to be reexamined by a member of the Rangers' medical staff in New York by Monday morning at the latest. An updated report on his condition is not likely to be available until Monday afternoon. He has been playing with back problems all season and missed six games immediately before the All-Star Game break with a fractured wrist.

"How long has it been since the whole team's been together -- three months now?" Messier said. "It's pretty disappointingbut it's amazing to see the guys pulling together the way we have. I think it shows the kind of character and commitment this team has. Injuries can't seem to stop us."

Messier's situation put a damper on what was an otherwise heartening Rangers trip. In five gamesthe team picked up 7 of 10 possible points and almost had five victories; one game slipped away late in the final period and the other ended in a tie. On Saturday nightthe Rangers were forced to abandon their attacking style in the absence of the injured defensemen Zubov and Patricktheir top offense-minded blueliners besides Leetch. But they still managed to hold off Edmonton.

 1287,  2011, a, The N.F.L. and its players have been throwing verbal barbs at each other in recent weeks as they try to work out a new labor agreement. The players unionthoughappears to have lost at least one megaphone.

CBS College Sports Network has refused to air a commercial produced by the N.F.L. Players Association for Saturday’s Texas-America All-Star gamewhich is sponsored by the union.



As part of their nearly year-old agreement with the hosts of the event and College Sports Networkthe union says it was promised two minutes of free air time with no content restrictions.

So it produced a 30-second and a one-minute commercialthe first cuts of which were given to the network in mid-Januaryaccording to George Atallaha spokesman for the players union. He added that the network rejected them late last weeksaying that it did not want to get in the middle of the dispute over the collective bargaining agreement.

The one-minute version of the commercial clearly flouts the union’s agenda. It features scenes of empty stadiumslocker rooms and gymsand fans and players saying “let them play” and “let us play,” and an allusion to the threat of a lockout by the N.F.L. owners if a new labor deal is not reached by March 3.

At the end of the commercialthe screen reads“Do Your Part to Let Us Play. Sign the petition at www.nfllockout.com//www.nfllockout.com/.”

“It’s unfortunate they seem to be scared off,” Atallah said of the network. “I hope this puts the spotlight on the college all-star game and the players who might be locked out.”

Dana McClintocka spokesman for CBS College Sports Networkconfirmed that the network did not want to take sides in the labor disputeand that it wouldn’t run a similar ad from N.F.L. either. CBS is one of four networks that pays the N.F.L. $4 billion to broadcast their games.

Addressing suspicions that the network balked so as not to offend the leagueGreg Aielloa spokesman for the N.F.L. said the league did not know about the network’s decision and had no objection to anyone running the ad.

An executive vice president with a blond bouffant and exquisitely proper business attireshe is merciless and mirthlessespecially in the boardroom scenesas she eviscerates performanceshelping to determine who is not worthy to toil for Himself.

''Carolyn is beautiful and she has a great look,'' Mr. Trump says of the businesswoman who oversees 250 Trump Organization employees and has worked for him almost as long as she's been married (a decadeto Georgea project manager for another developer). ''But she is all business and not a lot of monkey business.''

Maybe so -- she did allow herself just three weeks' maternity leave after the births of Connor31/2and Cassidy19 months -- but this tallpretty womanlaughing and smiling as she dashes into her office at the Trump National Golf Club in Briarcliff ManorN.Y.looks younger and more approachable than she does on TV.

 4140,  1995, a, Among other scenes he did not choose to recall aloud were those of Haitian refugees adrift at sea as their rulers spent months mocking American threatsand the violence that broke out in the streets of Port-au-Prince last fall even as American soldiers looked on.

InsteadMr. Clinton sought to make indelible a vision of a United States putting its power to good service. From the steps of the gleaming National Palace and from the side of President Jean-Bertrand Aristidewho had sent Mr. Clinton and his predecessor into fits of exasperation over what they saw as his uncooperativeness in exilethe President declared that the American-led mission "has been accomplished and with remarkable success."

"Today we come together as friends," Mr. Clinton told the citizens of a country whose plight has for so long confounded American leaders.

Even last Septemberas he sent American soldiers back to Haiti for the first time since F.D.R.Mr. Clinton always described their objectives as limited. In a Haiti that is still desperately poor and much less than stable -- despite an operation that has cost $900 million since United States soldiers landed on Sept. 17he was careful to repeat those cautious words today.

But with Republicans in Congress outspoken in their criticism of peacekeeping missionsand with public opinion polls showing tepid support for American involvement herethe President also transformed his appearance into a kind of emblem.

He recalled the doubts that were raised last summer as his showdown with Haiti's military leaders reached its crucial pointand he made clear that he had no doubt that he had chosen the proper course.

"Seven months agothe world wondered whether the United States could summon the will to protect democracy in this hemisphere," Mr. Clinton told the soldiers this morning. "Now the world knows once again that the United States will honor its commitment and stand up for freedom."

 5007,  1990, a, With prayers and admonitions from Pope John Paul II238 Roman Catholic bishops from around the world convened today for a synod to study the ''identity crisis'' and ''burnout'' said to be afflicting many of their priests.

For the next monththe bishops will meet at the Vatican almost daily to examine the selection and training of priests in a church plagued by a serious shortage of clergymen.

But church leaders have made clear that a few fundamental aspects of the problem are off-limits to debatenotably the Catholic requirement of priestly celibacy and the prohibition against ordaining women and married men. RepeatedlyJohn Paul has left no doubt that these rules will remain intact during his papacy.

If anythingVatican officials saidthe subject of celibacy should arise at the bishops' conference only in the context of how to reinforce the regulation. Their goal would be to help seminary students and priests overcomeas one senior official put it''any hidden frailtiespoor motivation or deep resistance'' that they may have.

The State Department’s revised supplemental environmental impact statement on the proposed 1,700-mile Keystone XL pipeline is outand offers very little that Secretary of State John Kerry or President Obama might use as a reason to reject the plan.

You can best gauge the reaction of various factions on Twitter using the #noKXL and #keystoneXL tags.

The voluminous report includes this blunt conclusion on the inconsequential nature of the pipeline if one’s interest is in reducing extraction and use of oil from the Alberta depositsor anywhere else for that matter:

Based on information and analysis about the North American crude transport infrastructure (particularly the proven ability of rail to transport substantial quantities of crude oil profitably under current market conditionsand to add capacity relatively rapidly) and the global crude oil marketthe draft Supplemental EIS concludes that approval or denial of the proposed Project is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the rate of development in the oil sandsor on the amount of heavy crude oil refined in the Gulf Coast area.

 342,  2017, a, CBGB was like a witch’s house with its stucco exteriorswinging wooden doors and opaque windows smeared with layers of fliers and wheat-paste residue. We walked inand I was entering the dreams I envisioned from the pages of Rock Scenewhich included the row of beer signs hanging from the ceiling leading to the stage. It was $3 to enterwhich at that time was fairly steepat least for teenagers from Connecticut with just enough coin from lawn-mowing jobs to pay for gascigs and a few Cokes. We were out of money and wondering how to get in when I noticed Richard Hell hanging around the door. I asked him if he could help. He had a stamp on his hand and licked it and pressed it on oursand we slinked in.

We slowly moved toward the frontall new terrain for usand suddenly a beer bottle came flying at high speed from across the roomwhizzed right past my head and crashed into the wall behind the bar. And no one reacted! We found a seat and watched as a couple of cats and a dog named Jonathan moved through the audience and on and off the stage. People were eating hamburgers and smoking in the midst of the coolest place on Earth. The Mumps came onand there was the lead singer Lance Loud dancing like a madman with the remarkable Kristian Hoffman on keyboards. And then Blondie playedand it was beyond great with Debbie Harry karate-kicking the audience and Gary Valentine bopping in dark shades.

Over timeI realized that not all the bands at CBGB were amazing. There were definitely some dudsa lot of faded stardust with yesterday’s shag haircutbut signals were changing. What struck me the most was the sheer bloody-mindedness of the artistspoetsfilmmakers and musicians who were rubbing up against one another there. Whatever glamour there was on that stagemany of the artists were basically subsisting at poverty level. Fame had little to do with moneywhich the club infamously paid little of. But being there felt like you were at ground zero of the most critical listening room of the future.

CBGB was our university. We all met each other in 1976and some of us — Jim JarmuschLydia LunchJean-Michel BasquiatKathy AckerGlenn Branca et al. — realized immediately that our devotion was decided. By the end of the year I’d be playing in the Coachmenan art school band from the Rhode Island School of Design informed by the college mates Talking Headsné the Artistics/Autistics. By springtime ’77 I had my $115-a-month pad on 13th Street between Avenues A and B. When Sonic Youth came together in late 1980I asked Hilly Kristalthe proprietor of CBGBif we could play there. He recognized me from being this kid who basically lived at his club since late ’76 and said“Of course you can.” He became a champion to mealways letting me present the band there in any context. When people ask me how I tune my guitarI always say CBGB.
 4836,  1991, a, President Bush will extend formal recognition to LatviaLithuania and Estonia on Monday regardless of whether the Soviet legislature acts to grant Baltic independence by thenAdministration officials said today.

The officials said that although Mr. Bush had been withholding formal recognition of the three republicsout of deference to President Mikhail S. Gorbachevhe had decided that he is giving Soviet legislators enough time to act.

"We wanted to give them a respectable grace period so if we had to act on our ownnobody could complain that we did it precipitously," one official said.

The American officials' comments today appeared to be a clear effort to prod Soviet legislators. The Soviet Congress of People's Deputies meets in Moscow on Monday. It would have a full working day to act even if Mr. Bush were to make such an announcement as early as mid-morning on Monday herebecause Moscow time is seven hours ahead of Eastern Daylight Time.

Sam Altman

One of the things that surprises me most about sort of the criticism of the tech industry right now is a belief that tech should be the one to decide what you can and can’t say and how these algorithms work. And thatto mesounds very bad. I think I’m totally cool withfor examplerestrictions on free speech where it’s hurting people. And I think we’ve always hadyou knowI can’t yell “Fire!” in this room. So there’s always been free speech with an asterisk.

But the idea that these companies who are not accountable to us or elected by us should get to decide sort of the new safeguards of societythat seems like the wrong way to do it.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether trades in health care stocks by the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors as recently as last year were made using inside informationa person briefed on the matter said on Wednesday.

The investigation comes as SACone of the most prominent hedge funds in the world with $12 billion in assets under managementhas become something of a focal point for authorities. Two former SAC portfolio managers have pleaded guilty to criminal charges of using inside information to trade technology stocks.

And Senator Charles E. GrassleyRepublican of Iowahas questioned how the S.E.C. handled referrals from Wall Street’s self-regulatorthe Financial Industry Regulatory Authorityregarding 20 stock trades by SAC.

But the S.E.C.’s investigation into trading by SAC appears to be much broader. In addition to the inquiry into trading in health care stocks — trades that took place from at least 2007 through 2010 — the agency is examining SAC’s use of expert network firmscompanies that connect Wall Street investors with outside experts in various industriesthe person briefed on the matter said.

Separatelythe S.E.C. is looking into whether the hedge fund used inside information about the 2007 takeover of MedImmunea biotechnology companythe person said. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported about the inquiry into MedImmune.

A spokesman for the S.E.C. declined to comment.

Neither SAC nor its billionaire founderSteven A. Cohenhas been accused of wrongdoing by the S.E.C. or by any other authority. A spokesman for SAC declined to comment on Thursday.

The inquiries into the SAC trades are part of an accelerating effort by the S.E.C. and the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan to crack down on insider tradingwith a particular focus on hedge funds. The criminal investigations by federal prosecutors have resulted in charges against 49 people39 of whom have pleaded guilty.

Two people who have pleaded guilty were the former SAC employees Noah Freeman and Donald Longueuil. Mr. Freeman is expected to testify Thursday at the trial of Winifred Jiaua consultant for an expert network firm who is charged with leaking inside information. SAC has said that it is “outraged” by the conduct of the two former employees.

The cases against Mr. Freeman and Mr. Longueuil are part of the government’s examination of expert network firmswhich developed over the last decade alongside the proliferation of hedge funds. The government has filed criminal charges against 13 people connected to the firmseight of whom have pleaded guilty.

The former SAC employees admitted to obtaining inside information about public companies and then using it to make profitable trades. The charges against the men detailed a cover-up straight from a television drama that involved destroying a hard drive with pliers and spreading the parts throughout the city.

Others with past ties to SAC have also been ensnared in the insider trading investigation. Earlier this yearFederal Bureau of Investigation agents raided two hedge funds founded by former SAC executivesLevel Global Investors and Diamondback Capital Management. In 2009Richard Choo-Beng Lee pleaded guilty to insider trading related to activity after he left SAC.

The S.E.C. has faced criticism that it failed to bring significant cases against prominent hedge funds as well as cases stemming from the financial crisis.

In AprilSenator Grassley asked the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in a letter to provide information on the “potential scope of suspicious trading activity” at SAC.

Last monthhe followed up with a letter to the S.E.C. requesting to know how it handled past referrals about SAC’s trading activity.

MedImmune is not among those trades referred by Finraaccording to people briefed on the matter.

SAC executives including Peter Nussbaumthe firm’s general counseland its outside lawyers met with staff members in Mr. Grassley’s office to discuss his inquiry.

Additionallyfederal prosecutors are examining trades in an account overseen by Mr. Cohen.

Court filings related to the cases of the two former SAC portfolio managers who have pleaded guilty to insider tradingindicate that the government is reviewing trades made in Mr. Cohen’s account at the suggestion of the former employees.

 2655,  2004, a, Even the presidential debates are such a throwback to the Eisenhower era that the networks might as well broadcast them in black and white. The PBS anchor Jim Lehrer was not chosen to moderate all three presidential contestsas he has been in the past. He was assigned only the first debate in Florida. The next two will be presided over by other agingwhite males: Charles Gibson of ABC and Bob Schieffer of CBSthe only two network news anchors who make Mr. Lehrer seem kooky. (Gwen Ifillwho is female and blackwill moderate the less important vice presidential debate.)

This season no new sitcoms are centered on a female character. NBC has a "Friends" spinoff"Joey," starring Matt LeBlanc; ABC has "Rodney," based on the good-old-boy humor of the country-western comic Rodney Carrington; and CBS has "Center of the Universe," starring John Goodman -- without Roseanne Barr. HBOalways a trendsetterintroduced a no-girls-allowed series this summer"Entourage," about a young Hollywood actor and his possethat was one longadmittedly funny bachelor party.

Meanwhilecomedy-variety shows are positively reveling in their new-found freedom to be unfair.

The jokes at comedy roasts are almost always disparaging on the basis of racecreed or sexbut until recentlynetworks tried to sit up straight during the family hour. NBC's "Last Comic Standing" lets amateur stand-up comedians vent the kind of material at 8 p.m. that is usually left to late-hour improv nights in comedy clubs. On a recent episode the contenders taunted a heavy-setblack female contestant with weight and race jokes. (One said she could not eat Tootsie Rolls because she might bite off her own fingers.)

Not surprisinglythenstrong female characters are also having a dry spell on the new season's dramas. The networks have no new police series like "Cold Case" or "Crossing Jordan" this fall. The only new hard-boiled female detective is a high school studentVeronica Marson UPN. Heather Locklear shares top billing with Blair Underwood on NBC's airport drama "LAX," butbless her heartshe is still more bimbo than Rambo.

The antifeminist mood is widespreadparticularly on reality shows like "The Apprentice" and "Wife Swap," where single career women are cute and flirty and married women do housework. But it is most noticeable on sitcoms because it was not long ago that the genre was dominated by strongfunny women and especially by strongfunny women who made fun of menfrom "Roseanne" and "Murphy Brown" to "Ally McBeal" and "Sex and the City."

 2856,  2003, a, But after he heard the testimony of SUNY's chancellorRobert Kingat the committee hearing in New York City on TuesdayMr. Canestrari saidhe doubted that SUNY would deliver such material before the governor issued his next executive budgetfor the 2004-05 fiscal year.

''These are public dollarsand legislators have a right to know how they will be spent,'' Mr. Canestrari saidexplaining why he and other legislators wanted more information. ''I don't know why SUNY won't provide it. They have done it before. It is not as if we are reinventing the wheel.''

David Henahana SUNY spokesmansaid that five years agoSUNY assessed each campus's critical maintenance needs before assembling a five-year capital request. This timehe saidthe university had planned to allocate money based on the size in square feet ''to provide the campuses with maximum flexibility.''

If SUNY was loath to be more specificCUNY faculty membersstudents and administrators turned out in force at the Assembly hearing last week to make the case for how capital ought to be spent at their university.

Some of the most devastating testimony came from the chairwoman of the biology department at the City College of New YorkJane Gallagherwho said the college's Marshak science building had deteriorated to the point of crisis. She said that people fainted from leaking fumes in the building and had to be carried out on stretchersand that black dust showered on people from air ducts.

''We have been inundated in water from broken pipes to the point where we have had waterfalls going down the fire stairs from the 13th floor to the basement,'' Ms. Gallagher said. ''Every time it rains outsidewater seeps from the external balconies into the labs on the corners of the building. Some of the labs have growths of species of fungi known to be harmful to human health. We have been unsuccessful in eradicating these fungi.''

Barbara Bowenpresident of CUNY's faculty and staff unionthe Professional Staff Congresssaid many CUNY colleges had poor conditionsincluding falling concreteelevators that do not reach all floors and crowding that results when 18,000 students are squeezed into space designed for 7,000.

 1550,  2010, a, Jeffrey Staab/CBS

— For years CBS has lagged behind other television networks in its inclusion of gaylesbian and transgender characters. In the season that starts in Septemberhowevera gay character will join “The Good Wife,” a lesbian character will join “Rules of Engagement” and a gay character will appear in the new sitcom “$#*! My Dad Says.”

Speaking last week to television reportersNina TasslerCBS entertainment presidentsaid the network was adding the characters to its prime-time programs “because we’re very disappointed in our track record so far.”

That record has been scrutinized by Glaadthe Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. For four yearsthe group’s Network Responsibility Index has assessed the quantity and quality of gay and lesbian representation on TVand the results have not been positive for CBS. For the first two yearsCBS was labeled adequate; for last year and the current one it was labeled failing.

In its most recent studyreleased in JulyGlaad said that 7 percent of CBS’s prime-time hours included content that was “L.G.B.T.-inclusive,” for lesbiangaybisexual and transgenderfar fewer hours than the CW (35 percent)Fox (30 percent)ABC (26 percent) or NBC (13 percent) networks. “For several years,” Glaad said in the studyMs. Tassler “has publicly promised greater L.G.B.T.-inclusion in scripted programming and has consistently failed to deliver.”

This yearthoughMs. Tassler announced the addition of the three characterssaying that when it became clear that none of CBS’s new shows included gay or lesbian charactersthe network looked for other opportunities to “improve the numbers we have represented in the casts.” She added: “So we’re going to do thatand then we’ll continue to focus on it as we go into the development season. We’re not happy with ourselves.”

Rashad Robinsonsenior director of media programs for Glaadsaid there had been no change in tactics that may have prompted Ms. Tassler’s announcementand no protest in the works. “I think this was part of the ongoing pressure that we’ve kept on CBS,” he said.
 1511,  2010, a, CHARLOTTEN.C. — Anthony Kim was on his way up the leader board at the Quail Hollow Championship on Saturday when he took a detour on the 16th hole that led to what could turn out to be the most entertaining shot of the tournament.

Kimthe 2008 champion herewas seven under after a birdie at 15 when his tee shot at 16 sailed deep into the pine trees lining the right side of the fairway. Kim could have easily punched it outwhich would have been the safe play. Insteadhe tried to thread the ball through a forest of pines toward the green.

“On 7I actually hit it through a tighter squeeze with a 3-wood and made a putt from off the green for birdie,” Kim said. “And so I figured I could do it againand it just didn’t work.”

From golf ball to pinballKim’s shot bounced off several treessailed over a fan’s head and wound up even farther to the right as it landed just off the adjacent 18th fairway.

Kim did not have much choice from there. After waiting for Bo Van Pelt and Robert Allenby to make their tee shots at 18Kim then sent a line drive 149 yards back down the 18th fairway in the opposite direction. The shot left him about 130 yards to the right of the 16th green. The only thing between Kim and the hole: a hillmore pine treeshundreds of fans and a 25-foot-tall grandstand.

With only a glimpse of the top of the flag at 16Kim lofted the ball over the stands and hoped for the best. Suddenlyhe heard a roar from the crowd surrounding the 16th green and smiled brightly. The ball had found the center of the greenjust under 20 feet from the flag. He barely missed the puttbut his double bogey drew huge cheers.

Kimplaying with a detached ligament in his left thumb that will require surgeryfinished the round at two-under 70. For the tournamenthe is five under par and in a tie for seventhfour strokes behind the leader Billy Mayfair.

He is right where he wants to beeven if he took a side trip to get there.

Asked what he needed to do on SundayKim said“Just hit a couple more fairwaysand if I get the ball rolling earlyI should have a good shot.”

 4198,  1995, a, The works in the exhibition "David Padilla Cabrera y Linda Matalon" are visually very differentbut together these two artists make an interestingly textured show at the Bronx Museum of the Arts.

Mr. Cabrera's small paintings look abstract but arein factshot through with autobiographical referencesmany to his childhood in a Chicano community (an identity alluded to in the Spanish conjunction used in the show's title).

The bright blue in a series of monochromatic panels is the color of his grandmother's California houseand the very name he's given to a cluster of yellow panels painted with green oval shapes -- "Aunt Sara's Rubber TreeOur Lady of Guadalupe" -- suggests a richcomplicated fragrance.

As in the pastMr. Cabrera's work is disarming in its formal modesty and its subtly stated concerns. Here and therethoughthe new paintings have an unresolvedpossibly transitional look. To some degree a lack of finish is what they're all aboutbut there's also a sense that good ideas have not yet been pushed as far as they could go.
 1132,  2012, a, Administrivial New Puzzle Blog Alert! If you love doing cryptic crosswordshopefully you’ve discovered the ones that Joshua Kosman and Henri Picciotto construct over at The Nation. Nowthey’ve started a new blog called Word Saladwhich will discuss the cryptic puzzles and more! Check it out here.

FRIDAY’S PUZZLE — Have you ever filled in an entry with little or no idea what it meant?

I enjoyed Scott Atkinson’s Friday offering very muchbut set a further challenge for myself today by doing the puzzle mostly from the Across clues. It’s a good thingtoobecause it got me 1 Down. Even soI had no idea what it meant. Never having heard the phrase “KATIE BAR THE DOOR,” I parsed the phrase incorrectly in every possible way except the correct one. Finallyjust as I was about to bow down to the Google godsit hit me (the phrasenot the door). That’s one I will not forget.

Evan Sung for The New York Times

Crossing Katie is ETERNAL OPTIMISTwhich I thought looked beautiful in the griddidn’t you? I also liked MOONLIGHT SONATA amongst the long entries.

In the Wordplay Department“Chihuahua scratch?” is a brilliant clue for PESOand the same goes for “It has a sticking point” for HYPO.

I usually get a lot of questions when a clue like this comes upso I will give 60 Down away right here: MNO are the three letters on the number 6 button on your phone. NoI don’t mind if you check. I’ll wait right here. See? You’re welcome.

Also from the “Are You Sure?” Department: The “Center of cat-tails” is O’NINE because … wellI’ll just let you look that one up yourself. And finallyyesNONCONTIGUOUSLY (in this puzzleat least) means that none of the black squares are touching each other.

Happy 100th birthday to the crossword cookiethe OREO. I bought a package of the special edition Birthday Cake Oreos and even though I am not a huge fan of the regular onesthese are awesome. The creme is much sweeter and is probably flavored to taste like frosting. They are a big hit in my houselet me tell youand there will be a showdown over the last cookie. Katie bar the door!

And nowyour Beethoven moment:

Your thoughts?
 1994,  2007, a, In the icy annals of emperor-penguin researchApsley Cherry-Garrard has been one-upped.

The British explorer described his research project as “The Worst Journey in the World,” a memoir that has become a classic of the explornography genre. In his 1911 quest to retrieve eggs from an emperor penguin rookeryCherry-Garrard trekked through the Antarctic winter with temperatures of -70 degrees Fahrenheit. He lost his tent (andhe assumedany prospect of surviving) when it was blown away during a blizzard by hurricane-force winds. The tent was miraculously found afterwardsand he survived to bring the eggs back to the Natural History Museum in London.

It was a heroic achievement. But for all that Cherry-Garrard endured in that darkfrigid winterhe neverto the best of my knowledgeattempted to measure the rectal temperature of an emperor penguin.

It remained for future researchers to accomplish that feat — and more. They also performed field surgery on an emperor penguin. By taking both the rectal and the core temperatures of emperor penguins at the rookerythey’ve learned the penguins’ secret for surviving the winter without a tent.

The American Physiological Societywhich is publishing the French research team’s resultsreports that the scientists began their work by “entering into the colony with bulb thermometers” and determining that “huddling penguins maintain a lower rectal temperature than birds which were isolated from the colony.” But that still didn’t quite explain how the penguins conserve enough energy to survive four cold months without eatingso the researchers captured five pairs of the birds and surgically implanted devices to measure the temperature deep inside their bodies.

The scientists found that the incubating birds lowered their core temperatures by two degrees Fahrenheit and kept it fairly constantaffected by neither the cold weather nor the heat generated when the penguins huddled together. The researchers suggest this constant temperature was achieved by a depression in the birds’ metabolic ratewhich “explains why the birds neither suffer from hyperthermia despite the very high ambient temperatures within the huddlenor become hypothermic due to the harsh cold.”

And how did the birds reduce their metabolic rate? “Such depression could be achieved by entering sleep. In factduring tight huddlesbirds were observed with their eyes closed.”

So the emperor penguins were sleeping on the job — not that there’s anything wrong with that. I don’t begrudge them their shuteyenor all the cinematic adulation they’ve been getting for their perseverance. But the more I hear about what’s been going on in these rookeriesthe more impressed I am with the perseverance of penguin researchers. There’s a book in this for one of the thermometer-toting scientists: “The Worst Job in the World.”

 5697,  1985, a, To the Editor:

Professor Tuerkheimer (letterFeb. 14) has not persuaded me that the grand jury acted properly in dismissing the case against Bernhard Goetz. The grand jury's purpose is to protect the innocent from groundless prosecutionand its secondary function is to economize on court resources.

There are indeed grounds to prosecute Bernhard Goetz. He shot four peopletwo in the backwith a weapon he knew it was illegal to carry. The court's time is not wasted in determining the guilt or innocence of the five parties to the incident.

A grand jury hearing is less of a venue than a courtroom trial. It's abbreviatedit's pro forma; in some casesit's perfunctory. It is not an appropriate venue for resolving issues that command national attention.

I am not cheered that the Goetz case was handled expeditiously. If the courts are overburdenedit is no victory that they are spared something as messy as the Goetz case. Mr. Goetz now stands accused only of having had the gunnot of shooting it. That's not justice; it's legal flimflammery.
 341,  2017, a, Mr. Sessions — whoin the first months of his tenureordered a broad review of federal agreements with law enforcement agencies — will oversee the outcomes of other casesincluding those surrounding the deaths of Eric Garnerwho was placed in a chokehold by a New York police officerand 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland.

The bar for charging police officers with federal civil rights violations is extremely highand prosecutions are rare. Even the Obama administrationwhich cultivated an aggressive reputation on such casesdeclined to prosecute officers in several high-profile killingsmost notably the 2014 shooting of Mr. Brownand it saw challenges in bringing charges in Mr. Sterling’s death.

On Tuesday eveningaround the Triple S Food Mart parking lot where Mr. Sterling was killedpeople congregated in the same way they did last summer. Mr. Sterling’s face is painted near the entrancewith stuffed animals in front. Signs advertise specials on cigarettes and fried chickenand another reads“Stop the Killing.”

“I’m not surprisedbecause it happens all the time,” said Kosher Weber21an African-American resident of Baton Rougeher voice cracking in anger. “Where do things go from here? There’s no justice. There’s no nothing.”

Derrick Brody45said: “Over and over again. They kill a human beingand they get away with itjust ’cause they got a blue suit.”

 5479,  1987, a, To some mixed emotionsthe Smithsonian's National Museum of American History opens an exhibit today celebrating the United States Constitution. Six years ago it decided to commemorate the signing of the Constitution with a $1 million study and exhibition that documents the experience of 120,000 United States citizens and residents of Japanese dissent who were interned in isolation camps in World War II and of the 30,000 Japanese-Americans who fought with United States forces in the war. The exhibit is meant to be a reminder of the ''imperfection of our efforts to produce perfect fairness,'' said the museum's directorRoger Kennedy.

Although a 1980 Congressional commission labeled the internment program a breech of constitutional rights and a result of wartime hysteria and racial prejudiceMr. Kennedy encountered no small opposition to his project.

Three times a request for appropriated funds for the exhibit was turned down by the Office of Managment and Budget. But the most overt disapproval has come from the publicin the form of several hundred hostile letters.

''For some people who were very deeply scarred by the Second World Warit is hard to distinguish between our fellow citizens of Japanese ancestry and those who inflicted the scars 45 years ago,'' Mr. Kennedy said.
 1704,  2009, a, The TV trucks arrived at 5 a.m.

I’m back at federal Bankruptcy Court in Lower Manhattanthis time to cover the first day of General Motors‘ long-awaited first-day hearings. (You can also follow along on Twitter.) And to no one’s surpriseI’m not the only one with that bright idea.

When I first arrived a little after 11it became readily apparent that the courthouse staff was well prepared for the blitz of observers who would arrive. The plaza in front of the Bankruptcy Court (in the same building as the National Museum of the American Indian) was neatly sectioned off by metal barrierscordoning off pits for the expected throngs of photographers and video camera crews.

And a small cadre of police and security officers were on hand to enforce orderthough none seemed particularly tense.

By 1 p.m.a half-dozen spectators had grabbed seats in Room 623. That actually isn’t the customary courtroom for Judge Robert E. Gerberwho was assigned to handle the G.M. casebut that of Chief Judge Burton Lifland. Judge Gerber happens to have the smallest courtroom of all the bankruptcy judges in Manhattana chamber roughly half the size of Judge Lifland’swhose much more spacious courtroom holds just under 100 people.

Within the hourhoweverthe benches in the room quickly accumulated occupants. Assorted items — file folders stamped with law firm namespapers bearing the CNBC logovarious coats and jackets — sat sentry for future occupants. So too did dozens of young adultstoo fresh-faced to be anything but seat-warmers of one kind or another.

(For what it’s worththe overflow room where I’ve camped out during the Chrysler hearings is far from packed. About a dozen folks are gathered herepecking away at their laptops.)

By 3:30 p.m.it was hard not to navigate through the hallways without running into clumps of dark-suited lawyers striding down the hallway toward Judge Lifland’s courtroomwhich had become standing room only. Younger associates were easy to spot: they were the ones wheeling along cartons of documents.

The hearing on Monday promises to be rather mundaneconcerned with typical first-day motions like payments to critical vendors and other concerns needed to keep the lights at G.M. on. The action should heat up when more controversial motionslike the proposed 363 saleget under way.

Date doesn't see herself creating a Japanese ground swell for tennis by becoming that country's first playerman or womanto crack the top 10. Her ambitionsby American standardsare modest. With her 24th birthday later this monthin her sixth year on the tourshe said she merely wants to achieve "realistic goals."

It could be that old habits are difficult to break. Date was introduced to the sport by her parents in Kyoto when she was 6. A natural left-handershe was informed that since the overwhelming majority of Japanese played tennis right-handedit might be viewed as culturally incorrect for her to play southpaw. Though she continues to write and eat with her left handshe switched to a right-handed gameforever more.

Date did have to rebel after convincing herself that she was good enough to play the pro circuit. After she graduated from high schoolher parents wanted her to go to college. She thought she was ready to see EuropeNorth Americathe world beyond Asia.

"I just told them I was going," she said.

Her ranking has risen steadily since 1989and she has beatenalong the wayArantxa Sanchez VicarioGabriela Sabatini and Mary Joe Fernandez. At the OpenDate hopes she can repeat the quarterfinal run she made here a year agowhen she took out Anke Huber and Jana Novotna along the way to being eliminated by Manuela Maleeva-Fragniere.

 6133,  1977, a, ALBANYDec. 2—The burning of two ranger cabins in the Adirondack Moun tains by the State Department of Environmental Conservation as part of policy to eliminate man‐made objects from the wilderness has touched off furor among local residents.

One called it “one of the most desgraceful acts of arson that has ever occurred within our wild forest country.”

The destruction of the two cabinsto be followed by the burning of more by the end of the yearis in keeping with the state's Land Use Master Plan to restore wilderness areas to what they were before man first set toot in them.

Implemention of the plan has already resulted in the removal of boat docks from some remote lakesthe closing of jeep and truck trailsthe removal of leantos and the destruction of fire towers. Local residents contend that the cabins are important to the preservastion ofhuman life in the area.

He gets “fan mail” with fake business cards tucked in that give his job title as a “starver of hungry children and elderly.”

To Mr. Mulvaneythis is evidence of a job well done.

“In our business that’s usually seen as a sign that the other side doesn’t know what to say substantively,” Mr. Mulvaney said during an interview Friday in his office at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.

 4878,  1991, a, The ordinance now provides that"whoever places on public or private property a symbolobjectappellationcharacterization or graffitiincluding but not limited to a burning cross or Nazi swastikawhich one knows or has reasonable grounds to know arouses angeralarm or resentment in others on the basis of racecolorreligion or gendercommits disorderly conduct and shall be guilty of a misdemeanor."

Local prosecutors used the law for the first time after the cross burning in the Joneses' yard to bring disorderly conduct charges against Robert A. Viktoraa 17-year-old high school dropoutand Arthur Miller 3dthen 18whose father lives across the street from the Joneses. Causing 'Skinhead Trouble'

According to the prosecutors' accountthe two young menand four of their friendswere at the Miller house on the night of June 21drinking and talking about causing some "skinhead trouble" and "burning some niggers," when they taped together two-foot-long cylinders from a broken chair to form a crosswrapped it in terryclothtook it into the Joneses' yarddoused it with paint thinnerlighted itand ran back to the Miller house to hide.

Mr. Miller pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor and was sentenced to 30 days in jail. But Mr. Viktorawho was charged both under the St. Paul hate-crime ordinanceand with assault in the fourth degreechallenged the ordinance as unconstitutional.

Mr. Viktorawho has been working at a nearby factoryhas been reluctant to talk to the press: Whatever the Supreme Court decides about the St. Paul ordinancehe still must stand trial on the assault charge. Last weekafter tentatively agreeing to be interviewedMr. Viktora failed to show upleaving his lawyer to speak for him.

And what his lawyerEdward J. Clearystresses is that it is not Mr. Viktoraor the cross burningthat is at issue in the Supreme Court case. 'It's the Law That's on Trial'

"There's no question that burning a cross on someone's lawn in the middle of the night is a crimeand there are plenty of criminal laws he could have been charged under that we wouldn't have challenged," said Mr. Cleary. "But in a country that values free speechwe should not have a law that says that expressing certain ideashowever offensive they may beis in itself a crime. It's the law that's on trial before the Supreme Courtnot my client."

 3521,  1999, a, No one took responsibility.

Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said the blast had been caused by a bomb containing about five ounces of TNT.

''The first thing that comes to mind is the situation in Dagestan,'' Mr. Luzhkov said. ''But a more serious examination is needed to make an accusation. Tonight we shall find out what kind of bomb it was.''

Near the Kremlin and Red Squarethe Manezh is a favorite hangout for young Muscoviteswho go there to socializewindow-shop and eat at its fast-food restaurants.

The blast took place at 7:59 P.M.ripping apart a video arcade. Blood was smeared across the floor of a McDonald's.

Of the 30 people who were woundedfive are in grave condition.

The blast came during a new wave of fighting in Dagestan. Today the Russian military attacked two villages close to the capitalMakhachkala. The attacks took place barely a week after Moscow declared that it had triumphed over Islamic militants who had crossed into Dagestan from Chechnya.

The only child of the late Senator Theodore McNeal and his wife VirgiePhilip was named after American labor movement giants A. Philip Randolph and Milton Webster. The elder McNeal worked with both men to organize the International Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Portersthe most prominent predominantly black labor union of its day.

Despite his demanding careerPhilip was active in his communityserving as a longtime board chair of the Montclair Human Needs Food Pantryformer trustee of Montclair Kimberley Academyand trustee of Newark Academy. But at the very center of his lifewas his devotion to GlendaSydney and Carter. He cherished each of them and their time together as a family. Philip found absolute contentment immersed in a finite set of passions: St. BarthsboatingLong Beach Islandand his circle of extended family and friends. They comprised an endless stream of precious memories punctuated by the unforgettable expression on Philip's face when Glenda surprised him with a 60th birthday party in January 2014. Soon afterPhilip was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Philip's battle to the end with this devastating disease was marked by the same integrityclarityand steadiness of spirit he embodied in his work and personal life. Philip passed away at homesurrounded by those he loved most on the eve of his and Glenda's 25th wedding anniversary. Thoughtful and generous to his corePhilip would want the battle against pancreatic cancer to continue in the form of funding research so that others might be spared what he endured. A fund has been established in his honor at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He is survived by GlendaSydney and Carter; his mother Virgiehalf-brother Theodore McNeal Jr.and an extended family that loved him dearly. Few are as stellar in life as they are claimed to be in memory; Philip McNeal wasand he will remain so in our heartsforever.

 403,  2016, a, Top supporters of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas held private meetings to sway potential new recruits at the annual winter conference hosted by Charles and David Koch this weekendaccording to a participant.

The conferencewhich brings hundreds of right-leaning donors and philanthropists together each year in Californiais the largest gathering of elite donors in the countryrepresenting some of the deepest pockets in politics.

Paul Singera legendary billionaire investor and donor to the Kochs’ political networkhosted an event to pitch donors on Mr. Rubiowhom Mr. Singer endorsed in December. Doug Deasona Dallas investor whose family is also active in the Koch-led political networkhosted an event aimed at bringing in help for Mr. Cruz.

Both candidates are among a handful of Republican contenders who have appeared at policy forums hosted by Americans for Prosperity and other issue organizations financed by the Kochs’ donor network.

Because it represents so many different donors with ties to a range of presidential candidatesthe Kochs’ network has shied away from intervening more actively in the Republican primary campaign. But this weekendaccording to the participantofficials with the Kochs’ political operation also began sounding out allied donors about a potential campaign against Donald J. Trumpwhose evolving views on issues like corporate subsidies put him at odds with the Koch network’s own policy priorities.

No decision had been made about a potential anti-Trump effortwhich was first reported by NBC.

"She brought out a birch-bark cradlewhich had its own irrigation system and in which she had carried her 20 childrenand insisted I take it," Ms. Gruber said. "She sounded just like my own motherand I wondered had I traveled 11,000 miles to find another Jewish mother."

Seventeen years later and marriedMs. Gruber had a daughterCelia Michaelsand two years later a sonDavid Michaels; the cradle was used for both.

Now Ms. Gruber has her bags ready to go to London as soon as she hears from her daughtera television producer and videotape editor who is due to give birth. And what will she take with her? "That birch-bark cradleof course."

The problemsthe witnesses saidinclude several fires and explosions over the past two years that destroyed some production facilitiesfailure to conduct mandatory quality control inspections of rocket components and a ''dismal'' record of correcting deficiencies that had been pointed out.

A joint Air Force-Thiokol study conducted after the space shuttle Challenger exploded Jan. 28killing the seven members of the crewfound that three of seven mandatory Government inspections of the critical seals in the booster rocket had not been carried outthe G.A.O. officials said.

 5868,  1984, a, At present the Labor Party holds a 25-seat majority. The comparisonhoweveris somewhat misleading because the House of Representatives has been increased for this election from 125 seats to 148 seatsa result of recent redistricting to reflect population changes.

The campaign has not been filled with sharp debates over issuesmainly because Mr. Hawke has transformed his party from an often shrill advocate of trade unionism into a champion of economic growth and cooperation between labor and management. Thushe has successfully captured the middle ground of Australian politicsundercutting the conservative opposition.

''Australia is conservative and so is Bob Hawke,'' said Don Aitkina professor of political science at the Australian National University in Canberra. Booming Economy Is Factor

In his 21 months in officeMr. Hawke has benefited from an end to a long drought in Australia and a worldwide economic recoveryled by the United States. But in additionMr. Hawke hammered out an accord soon after he took office between labor and management to restore growthreduce inflation and avoid strikes in a nation with a tradition of labor strife. The agreement was accomplished in dramatic fashion at a national economic meeting in April 1983and it has worked far better than most people at first thought possible.

Today the Australian economy is growing at a 10 percent annual rate and inflation is at its lowest point since 1970. For its partunemployment has dropped by almost 2 percent.

 3202,  2001, a, To the Editor:

Although I support the military operation in Afghanistanthe Oct. 29 photograph of four Afghan children being prepared for burial after an American airstrike is as haunting as some of the images from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks against our country. The accompanying news article about more civilian deaths because of the airstrikes is equally disturbing.

A dearth of obvious targets seems to be forcing the United States military to strike at marginal targetsleading to the death of innocent civilians. No matter how much good will the United States' military operation enjoysif major military actions can't be justifiedthe American peopleand their supporters around the worldwill see these actions as an illegitimate and unnecessary use of force.

The government has prepared us forand we will accepta long and difficult war against terrorism. Now the United States government and the military should take their timeand do it right.

 2129,  2007, a, As New York City election days gonext Tuesday’s is an uncommonly sleepy one with few races besides local judgeships.

Against that backdropthe award for the Hottest Race in Town easily goes to the battle for Staten Island district attorney. It is a hotly competitive one that pits the Republican incumbentDaniel M. Donovan Jr.against Michael J. Ryanthe Democratic candidate.

Mr. Ryana 42-year-old lawyer now in private practicehas run an aggressive campaign aimed at discrediting the incumbentsaying that Mr. Donovan has been inflating statistics about conviction rates and positioning himself for higher office at the expense of operating a well-run office.

An example of the fierce tone of the campaign is a television commercial in which Mr. Ryan highlights a Staten Island woman who accuses Mr. Donovan of setting free the man who sexually abused her daughter.

“Thanks to youMr. Donovanthere’s a sexual abuser walking the streets now,” the womanJo Marie D’Amatosays in the ad.



As with most races for district attorneythe candidates tend to frame the contest in terms of experience. Mr. Ryanfor

examplestresses that his years as a probation officerand as a top criminal justice official in the administrations of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Patakihave provided with qualifications that far exceed Mr. Donovan’s.

“I have a long history of involvement in the criminal justice system,” he said. “And I have a better understanding of how

to get things done in that office. The incumbent is simply campaigning on a platform of inflated statistics for the sake of his own political agenda. Plushe’s someone who is clearly positioning himself to run for higher office.”

To be sureMr. Donovan has been something of a rising star within the Republican Party virtually since his election in 2003. Early last yearRepublican leaders in the state tried to persuade him to challenge Jeanine F. Pirro for the party’s nomination for attorney general — before Mr. Donovan had even completed his first term. But the district attorney decided against runningsaying he did not have enough time to form the kind of campaign he would have liked before the September primary.

That kind of attentionhe explainsis a result of the success of his office in the last four years. Mr. Donovanlike his Democratic rivalagrees that experience is the major issue in the race. “My opponent has not been a prosecutor for even one day,” he said. “He has a background in criminal justicebut not as a prosecutor.”

He defends the statistics he has cited in the campaign about the increased rate of felony convictions in Staten Island. “The fact of the matter is that the statistics we cite were generated by the same agency that my opponent used to work forthe Division of Criminal Justice Services of the State of New York,” he added.

“And every year since I’ve been hereour performance has improved,” said Mr. Donovanwho turns 51 on Election Day.

“We have the highest felony conviction rates in the city of New York. We have the highest rate of conviction for drunk-driving offenses. We have led the city in every measurable category there is.”

As in most Staten Island racesthe endorsements in this one have been largely along political lines. The island’s Democratic officials have endorsed Mr. Ryanand Republican and Conservative Party leaders are endorsing Mr. Donovan. (Mr. Donovan is also running on the Conservative and Independence Party Lineswhile Mr. Ryan is also running on the Working Families Party line.)

For Mr. Donovanthe most notable exception has been James P. Molinarothe Staten Island Borough president. Mr. Molinaroa longtime Conservative Party officialtook out a full page ad in The Staten Island Advancecriticizing Mr. Donovan as being responsible for fate of Mr. Molinaro’s grandson Steven Molinarowho was sentenced to prison for violating his probation on charges of assaulting a newspaper carrier.

Mr. Donovanwho was Mr. Molinaro’s deputy before becoming district attorneyrecused himself and instead turned the case over to a special prosecutor from Manhattan to avoid a possible conflict of interest.

 5208,  1988, a, NO sooner is Willie Nelson released from jail after serving 20 years for trying to rob a trainthan he gets together that old gang of his and goes off to try to rob a train again. He knows that an ex-Texas RangerRichard Widmarkwho stopped him the first timewill be out to get him againwith that old gang of his.

Old is the key word in ''Once Upon a Texas Train,'' the two-hour television movie on Channel 2 at 9 P.M. Sunday. Some of the robbers and lawmen hauled out of retirement have trouble shooting in the right directionstaying in the saddle and telling a horse from a bicycle.

The notion of a tale about aging cowboys is not exactly originalbut this easygoing effortwrittenproduced and directed by Burt Kennedyambles amiably along as the pals regroup and head toward the bend of the Rio Brazosonly to discover that the river has long since dried up and the railroad tracks have been torn up. Just about thendurn itthe script dries up or goes off the trackstranding all partieslike the little engine that couldn't.

Mr. Kennedy tries to keep things chugging by bringing in Angie Dickinsonwho won the hearts of both Mr. Widmark and Mr. Nelson when they were comrades in the Confederate Army. She looks mighty good for a gal from the Old Confederacy and smiles lovingly upon both her creaky suitorsbut such affairs produce no steam. Thenthere is a gang of young baddies who dare to confront the old baddiesa prolonged encounter that makes little sense even for a television western. The chief young baddie gets to kiss a pretty miss who is brought on for no other reason than to be kissed. It is an uphill trip before the final improbable shoot-out between the generations in one of those empty towns whose only industry is shoot-outs.

Verlyn Klinkenborg's Editorial Observer about H. L. Mencken (''Remembering the Permanent Opposition of H. L. Mencken,'' Dec. 30) made me reflect on how outrage serves our democracy.

Senator Trent Lott's record on race has finally raised the ire of the Republican Party. But Senator Bill Frist shows that a sexist may still wander where racists fear to tread.

Mr. Frist's opposition to sex educationinternational family planning and emergency contraception demonstrates an attitude toward women that also deserves a vehement outcry. The discrimination against women still practiced by the Augusta National Golf Clubwhich didn't admit a black member until 1990suggests that misogyny may have even deeper roots than racism.

I hope that I live long enough to see insensitivity to women by our leaders get the anger it deserves.

 4814,  1991, a, The choice of the Narragansett Hotela home to many college students during the school yearwas not the Cheikh's; his followers in New York picked it for him.

"We were looking for two weeks," said Mouhamadou Lamime Diagnea trade analyst who picked up the Cheikh at the airport. The Narragansetta mostly single-room occupancy hotel near 93d Street"was the one we found so he will be near the community," Mr. Diagne said. Most Senegalese in New York live in Harlem.

Cheikh Mbacke's visitlately an annual eventhas become a spectacle. When he emerges from the hotel each morninghe is surrounded by a security team. They have to contend with some of the Cheikh's followers waiting outside who rush toward himhoping to touch his clothing. "We keep telling him he should move to Central Park West," said one security officer with walkie-talkie in hand. "It's impossible to protect people here."

The 74-year-old Cheikh then climbs into a limousine and goes off in a motorcade that takes him around the city.

Inside the hotelhundreds of visitors arrive in the course of a day -- some in bright robessome in gaudy T-shirtssome in business suits. Many pack the elevator to see the Cheikhwho is on the eighth floor with his retinue of about 15 peoplemost of them older men. When visitors arrivehe retreats behind a veiled doorway to greet them.

Re “Visions of Trumptopia” (editorialMarch 1):

President Trump made an admirable attempt at being a statesman in his first speech to Congress on Tuesday nightbut a controlled Donald Trump is still Donald Trump. It is far too late to fool us by putting on sheep’s clothing.

President Trump used an expanded vocabulary in his speech in an effort to sound presidentialadmittedly with some success. But beneath the artificial veneer still lies the soul of a man who lacks compassion and is grandiosely self-promoting.

One speech does not a president make. We still cannot see the president’s tax returnshis multiple conflicts of interest have not been properly addressedand a full investigation of possible Russian ties will likely never happen with a Republican-controlled Congress.

President Trump failed to convince me that he is working for the American people. His desire for rollbacks related to food and drug protectionsclean water and financial regulations shows a man who is anything but a servant of and for the American people.

 7444,  1964, a, SAIGONApril 30 (UPI)—A squad of 10 Communist guerrillas penetrated the capital of Long An Province this weekcaptured 74 former comrades who had defectedand fled with themAmerican sources disclosed today.

The raiders managed to capture the defectors without firing a shot in a stealthy operation that United States sources said had dealt the Saigon Government a severe psychological blow.

There was speculation that many of the prisoners would be executed.

According to the reportthe 10 guerrillas crept into Tan An shortly after midnight Monday. Tan An is 20 miles from Saigon.

The report of the raid came as the Government announced the release of 2,109 persons who had been held for political reasons. The announcement was made at a ceremony at Cong Hoa Stadium in Saigon that was presided over by Premier Nguyen Khanh. About 1,200 of those who had been detained were present.

 5316,  1988, a, When Franklin Roosevelt nominated Felix Frankfurter to the Supreme Courtin 1939voices of the extreme right called Professor Frankfurter a Communist. They citedespeciallythe fact that he was a member of a national committee of the American Civil Liberties Union.

On Jan. 121939Frankfurter himself appeared as a witness before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee: a break from the traditional practice of Supreme Court nominees. The questionsbegun by Senator William E. BorahRepublican of Idahofocused on his association with the A.C.L.U.

Frankfurter explained how the Civil Liberties Union had come into being after World War Ia time of public hysteria about supposed radical plots. He had been a Federal prosecutorFrank-furter saidand he knew about the dangers of power in official hands. He knew the need for ''a group of people whose special job it should be to be watchful [ of ] the Bill of Rights.''

As an example of his rolehe said the A.C.L.U. had consulted him about whether to help the Ku Klux Klan when Boston officials tried to stop it from holding a parade. ''I said'Of course civil liberty means liberty for those whom we do not like or even detest.' '' (He was surely paraphrasing a passage in one of his favorite opinions by Justice Holmes: ''If there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other it is the principle of free thought - not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate.'') Senator Borah asked about the relationship of the A.C.L.U. to Communism.

 6426,  1970, a, Atter its sharp decline on Thursdaythe world sugar futures market regained a little equlibrium yesterday. Trading slowed from a near record 6,344 contracts to 1,400 contracts.

The sharp drop on Thursday followed reliable reports of better than expected supply situation. Yesterdayat the opening of tradingthere was some further liquidation of sugar contracts by speculatorsprobably due to some margin calls after Thursday's debacle.

As one broker commentedthe selling may have been overdone because trade buying entered to steady the market and push prices ahead for the day.

 4853,  1991, a, "Turnover causes us tremendous heartburn," said Robert Colettageneral sales and service manager for G.M.'s Buick division. Salespeoplehe saidneed about a year to fully understand a manufacturer's products and a dealer's procedures. And as cars grow more complexhe addedthat learning period grows longer.

One of the earliest deferred bonus plans began two years at Volkswagenwhich for every car sold pays the sales representative $150 -- in three installmentsspread over two years. The bonus comes on top of whatever commission the dealer pays the sales staff. Volkswagen officials have no statistics on whether the program has reduced turnoverbut they say dealers have told them it has helped.

Audi of America offers yearly bonuses of $6,000 to salespeople who sell 60 carsand $12,000 and a trip to Germany to those who push 120 cars out the door. The wait is not as long as with Volkswagen's program but the idea is the same: to keep top producers in the foldsome of whom had left as sales drooped.

"If you lose a guy who's worth a hundred cars a yearit's like losing a whole dealer," said Joseph H. Tategeneral sales manager of Audi of America.

Fritz Hitchcockthe owner of the Toyota dealership where Mr. Salcido workscalls the traditional commission system "very destructive." But Mr. Hitchcockwho has set up his own deferred-bonus programdoubts whether other alternatives -- some sort of guaranteed salarysay -- would be the answer. "It's hard to figure out if a guy is giving you his all if he's on a guarantee as opposed to a commission," Mr. Hitchcock said.

Mr. Salcido and other salesmen said that deferred bonus programs like the one offered by General Motors were a nice perkbut were not enough to make salespeople stick around after several slow months at a dealership. "It's an extrabut people want money nowsaid one Detroit-area car salesman who insisted that he not be identified. "My mortgage bill is now." An Inherently Transient Business

Salespeople and car dealers say they applaud any programs designed to reduce turnover and improve the image of salespeople. But many also believe the incentives or courses do not address the fundamental realities of selling cars that make it such a transient business: long hoursfew benefits and unpredictable paychecks.

 3080,  2001, a, Voices were hoarse from cheering by the end of the evening on Tuesdaywhen the Paul Taylor Dance Company opened its three-week season at City Center. Mr. Taylor's new ''Fiends Angelical'' is not a major workthough his minor works have a way of joining that august company as years go by. But two classics -- ''Arden Court'' and ''Esplanade'' -- completed the program in the superbly danced single performances of the engagement.

One of the pleasures and challenges of entering into Mr. Taylor's cosmos is that things tend to be not quite what they seem. Angels are suspiciously diabolical. Devils have an almost imperceptibly angelic tinge or a redeeming dose of comic misbehavior. But the feeling persists in ''Fiends Angelical'' that Mr. Taylor himself has not quite decided on who is who and what is what in the new piecewhich spins out into space as a tightly constructed ritual and then ends abruptly and inconclusively.

All rituals need at least temporary resolutions. The problem may be that ''Fiends Angelical,'' set to a dark anecdotal score by George Crumbis something of an occasion piececommissioned for a 70th-birthday tribute to the choreographer at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival last summer. Given Mr. Taylor's enjoyably anarchic impulsesit is unsurprising that the new dance is on the slight side.

A clan of tightcrooked-limbed bodies whirl and caper across the stage. The nuzzling and entangling of two disgorged members (Patrick Corbin and Lisa Viola) add moments of serenity to the mix. Presiding over them all is a horned goddess (Silvia Nevjinsky)whose rising and falling arms suggest a puppeteer's domination. The creatures rise high on their feet at the endtheir arms waving softly in the dimming light. Are these fiends crossing over to the side of the angels?
 4645,  1992, a, Two teammateshis manager and general manager were among those who testified yesterday in Manhattan on behalf of Steve Howe in his arbitration hearing against major league baseball. The Yankee relief pitcher was permanently suspended last Wednesday for violating baseball's drug policy.

Although General Manager Gene MichaelManager Buck Showalterteam captain Don Mattinglycatcher Matt Nokes and his wifeKristywere among those who spoke on behalf of Howeno decision was reached. The hearing will resume Friday and arbitrator George Nicolau will probably not make a decision until next week.

Mattingly said he was asked what type of person he felt Howe was and how people reacted to him. Michael declined to discuss aspects of the hearingbut said about nine or 10 players attended as a show of support for Howe.

Interior Minister Hassan al-Alfiwho was wounded in an assassination attempt earlier this yearsaid in an interview with the newspaper Al Ahram that a raid on Wednesday by more than 2,000 police and paramilitary forces on an island in the Nile near the southern city of Asyut had resulted in the arrest of scores of suspects from the militant Islamic Group.

Mr. Alfi said the raid turned up maps and diagrams of the routes followed by several officials and some public figures who have attacked militant fundamentalist views. Backing From Abroad

Mr. Alfi said there was also evidence of financial support and contacts between the suspects and four other Middle East countries. He would not identify the targets of the plot or the countries involved.

 3332,  2000, a, Ending a conflict over the fate of a forest rich in both wood and wildlifeloggersbiologists and the government of Gabon have agreed to keep bulldozers and chain saws out of a 1,900-square-mile reserve with the highest density of large mammals ever recorded in a tropical rain forest.

The deal includes a slight redrawing of the boundaries of Gabon's Lope Reservesubtracting 400 square miles of land on the southeastern flank that holds the richest stands of valuable okoume treesand adding about 200 square miles of previously unprotected terrain that includes remote upland forests that have only rarelyif everfelt the footfall of a human.

Several biologists working in the region say the net loss of land is worth it. The area opened to logging had been farmed less than 200 years ago and so is relatively recent growth. In contrastthey saythe newly protected areawhich was to have been cut by Malaysian and French companiesis a priceless reservoir of biological riches that is thought to have been essentially undisturbed for the last 10,000 years.

More importantthey saythe agreement -- signed last month by the country's major logging companiesthe governmentand a variety of private environmental groups -- finally brings meaning to the word reservewith the government and loggers committing for the first time never to violate the new boundaries.

 1397,  2011, a, Edson Buddle may be largely out of sight in Germany’s second divisionbut he is doing his best to make sure he isn’t out of mind as the United States national team continues to search for goal scorers.

Buddle scored with both feet on Saturday — a right-footed drive in the ninth minute and a left-footed lob in the 20th — but his clubF.C. Ingolstadtlost to Bochum5-3.

Saturday’s performance was Buddle’s second two-goal effort in three gamesand gives him five goals this season. That’s more than Juan AgudeloTeal Bunbury and DaMarcus Beasley have had in the past two monthsbut those three — along with Jozy Altidore and Landon Donovan — were included on U.S. Coach Jurgen Klinsmann’s roster for the team’s coming friendlies against Honduras and Ecuador.

Klinsmann called in Buddle for his first gamea tie against Mexico in Augustand praised his work rate even though he failed to create much and tired while working largely on his own.

But nowgiven that the Americans have scored only once in six halves since Klinsmann took overshould Buddle be one of the first names on his speed dial if someone has to pull out of camp this week? Or do you have faith in the players Klinsmann picked to finally get the U.S. on the board again?

DeCrane Jr. of BronxvilleN.Y.was married to Francis Page Johns Langforda son of Dr. and Mrs. Herbert Gaine Langford of JacksonMiss. Msgr. James M. Connolly performed the ceremonyassisted by the Rev. Jerry McBridean Episcopal priest.

The bridea graduate of Duke Universityis a research technician at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson. Her father is chairman of Texaco Inc. Her grandfather the late Mr. DeCrane founded the Wood Products Company in Cleveland.

Mr. Langforda third-year medical student at the University of Mississippialso graduated from Duke.

 2060,  2007, a, With a draw against Vladimir Malakhov of RussiaAlexander Grischukalso of Russiajoined Gata Kamsky of the United States and Peter Leko of Hungary as victors in their preliminary candidates matches. Judit Polgaranother Hungarianstaved off elimination by beating Evgeny Bareev of Russiaalthough she still trails 3 to 2 with one game to play. (If matches are tied after six gamesthere will be tie-breaker games to determine who goes through to the next round.) Magnus Carlsen of Norway also wonsquaring his match with Levon Aronian of Armenia at 2.5.

The matches are taking place in ElistaKalmykiato select four qualifiers for the world championship tournament in Mexico City in September and October. The games can be replayed here at the official Web site for the matches.

Polgarwho has been outplayed throughout the matchlaunched a speculative attack against Bareev on the White side of a Caro-Kann Defensebut Bareev missed two chances to survive the onslaughtfirst with 22 … Qb3 instead of 22 … Qb2and then with 23 … Rf7 instead of 23 … gh.

The Carlsen-Aronian match has been the most exciting of the preliminary matches with both players winning twice with only one draw. In today’s gameCarlsen got a good position on the White side of a Queens Indian and then worked up an attack on Aronian’s king. Aronian was able to force the trade of queens to end the attackbut in the resulting endgameCarlsen had a powerful pawn on f6. He then used excellent technique to create a winning position. It almost seems a shame that one of these players will not make it through to the next round.

Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan and Boris Gelfand of Israel drew their fifth straight game. Although that might sound boringthe games have not been. They have just been incredibly hard fought by two players with similar styles who are experts in the systems that they employ. In today’s gameKasimdzhanovas Blackplayed a Semi-Slav. He allowed his pawn structure to be wrecked and stranded his king in the centerbut he got fantastic play for his piecescreating a dynamic position. Although Gelfand eventually won a pawnKasimdzhanov showed that he had enough resources to secure a draw.

Michael Adams of England drew with Alexei Shirov of Spain to preserve his 3 to 2 lead. Sergei Rublevsky of Russia drew against Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine and also leads 3 to 2.

 3553,  1999, a, So the corporate digs need spiffing up and you think some original art sure would be nice over the reception deskor in the conference room. Trueyou could get some by-the-numbers original oilsor an old master print -- but you want something with a bit more class.

Stillat today's art prices? Forget it.

Ian Peck has heard that cryand today he plans to start a Web sitefineartlease.comthatas its name impliesleases original artwork.

The good stuff includes the likes of N. C. WyethChagallHockney. Browse the site's gallery; if a painting grabs your fancyit can be had for as little as three months or as much as 10 years -- atsayroughly $1,400 a month for a painting valued at $75,000.

In a world where so much is borrowedwhy should art be any different? Think of the tax deduction on those lease payments -- starting at 15 percent of the painting's value a year. Mr. Peck cites the tax benefit as a big selling point.
 2625,  2004, a, STONINGTON has the kind of reputation that any town would treasure. It is an old-fashioned New England seaport town that still has a fishing fleet and where people from New York and New Jersey snap up second homes for a chance to live in a community that is right out of a Homer Price book.

But over the past yearthe town's reputation has darkened. The first selectman just resigned after he was arrested for repeated acts of sexual misconduct with a young girla town employee who gambled about $1 million at Foxwoods was arrested in June for embezzling $257,000 from the townand the Republican registrar of voters died in December after contracting flesh-eating bacteria. The harbormaster died in November after she was hit by a carthen hit again by a second car while she was being treated on the side of the road. The elderly man who ran the local Christmas tree farm was found severely beaten in his bedthen died a few weeks later.

And the bizarre case that still hovers over the townunsolvedis the death of a beloved second-grade teacherwho was found dead in her home at the bottom of a staircase in 2002. The teacherLeslie Buckdied just days after she told the police she had escaped a kidnapperwho she identified as a handyman often hired by her husbandCharles. A local barmaidwho bar employees said received expensive gifts from the husbandtold the police that Mr. Buck had asked her to run away with him a few hours before his wife's body was found. Last Tuesdaya jury found Russell Kirbythe handymanguilty of kidnapping the teacher. He faces up to 21 years in prison.

Things like this didn't happen to Homer Price.

''This is still an outstanding communitybut it's not the way it once was,'' said Police Chief David Erskine. ''Things are going to happen.''

FlashRadio (www.flashradio.com)which is scheduled to make its debut todaypresents five channels of different music themesincluding popalternative and urban. The added touch is that while the music playsthe monitor fills with a continuous animation show (the images are not tailored to the individual songsbut to the channel's ''mood'').

The station is the product of a joint effort between Sonicnet (www.sonicnet.com)the popular music entertainment site; Macromedia (www.macromedia.com)which makes animation softwareand the Intel Corporation. Nicholas Butterworththe 30-year-old president of Sonicneta division of TCI Musicconceded that there were already a lot of radio stations on the Internet. ''They have been great to listen tobut boring to watch,'' he added.

How much fun FlashRadio will be to watch may depend on the speed of your processor. Mr. Butterworth noted that a Pentium II processor was needed for optimal viewing. That is a vast minority of home computers.

Like the majority of New York City residentsI do not own a car. When I need to take motorized transportationI take a cab or subway or busand I have to pay for it every day of the week.

The City Council's vote to restore free Sunday parking (news articleJuly 28) is a handout to the minority of car owners.

Why should car owners be allowed to take up precious city real estate free of charge?

Free parking just encourages more driving. The streets of New York are crowded enough. We need the City Council to help relieve traffic congestionnot add to it.

The report on the poll said the telephone numbers were randomly selected. In a poll of this size with a random samplingthe results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.

Those who responded were more educated and affluent than averagea breakdown of respondents showed. Asked About Release of Prisoners

Predictablyin a country where people may be reluctant to tell their views to strangersa heavy majority said they supported Mr. Gorbachev's program of economic changes. But many of the questions showed signs of resistance to current domestic upheavals.

Asked if they felt the current policies would lead to higher prices in food stores72 percent said yes. Mr. Gorbachev has called for an eventual end to price controlsbut has vowed that no increases are imminent. Also65 percent approved of the creation of new cooperative restaurants and services.

Asked if they approved of the release of ''those who are called dissidents'' from prison or exile42 percent said no and 27 percent yes. It was the only question on which so many appeared to go against an action taken by the leadership. Scores of political prisoners have been released this yearand more releases are expected under an amnesty marking the 70th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution.

Asked if they were familiar with the name of Andrei D. Sakharov88 percent said yesalthough the data released here did not disclose whether they knew him as the father of the Soviet nuclear bombor as one of the country's foremost dissidents. Important Historical Figures

 4082,  1996, a, GROWING UP in small-town South JerseyI never heard the words ''deer problem'' until decades laterwhen I was working in upstate New York. One winter daya normally mild-mannered colleague trudged infuming about his near-death highway experience. The previous nighta deer had bounded from the woods and onto the hood of his car. Deer and car were totaled.

''This country has absolutely got to do something about the deer problem!'' he shouted.

''Like what?''

''Like napalm.''

Nowthis is probably not the sort of attitude one ought to convey to animal-rights advocates who have been camped out for a couple of days and nights in a cold November rain to protest a deer hunt. Neverthelessa few of them managed tight smiles the other day when I stopped at the bivouac they had made outside the entrance of Lewis Morris Parkdown Route 24 past Morristownto ask what was so awful about the Morris County Parks Commission's sending in a squad of trained hunters to kill a few hundred bothersome Bambis?

An April 24 news article notes that growth in income inequality over the last several decades was particularly pronounced in New York State.

The 1990's were a boom time for the state on averagebut the prosperity was not broadly sharedand New York's income gaps continued to grow.

These findings should serve as a wake-up call for New York policy makers. Religiouslaborcivicgovernment and business leaders should convene a series of summit meetings to address both the causes and the consequences of this situation and to develop a strategic plan for reducing child povertyincreasing job opportunities and ensuring that the incomes of working families do not continue to deteriorate.

Why Liverpool will win

Jürgen Klopp does not feel cursed. He does notas he made plain during his Friday evening news media call in Madrideven feel unlucky. He might have lost every final he has reached with Liverpooland six of the seven he has contested over allbut he does not see that as a harbinger.

The reason for thatput simplyis that this is the possibly the first time — and certainly the first time with Liverpool — that he has gone into a final in charge of the favorite. The bald fact of the Premier League table illustrates that Liverpool has been significantly more consistent than Tottenham this season: Klopp’s team eventually finished 26 points ahead of Spurs.

Throw in that Liverpool had England’s best defense and two of its three top scorersand then add that it went through the pompcircumstance and attendant emotional sweep of a Champions League final 12 months agoand Liverpool’s quietunassuming confidence is understandable.

 6245,  1973, a, A suit was filed In Federal Court here yesterday to prevent the confinement of children considered “incorrigibleungovernable or habitually disobedient.”

The suit seeks s the convening of a three‐judge panel to declare a state law unconstitutional for using “hopelessly vague” standards to confine children in state training schools or temporary detention facilities.

“This suit Is the beginning of an intensive and systematic effort to establish civil liberties for children,” according to Ira Glasserexecutive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.

Conditions Called Cruel

“All over this state,” he said“children who have committed no crimes are incarcerated with little or no due processconfined under duel and coercive conditionsand abused under color of law. We hope to persuade the courts that children are people within the meaning of our Constitution.”
 2676,  2004, a, To the Editor:

Social Security's founders applied a painful lesson from the securities market crash of 1929 when setting up the program in 1935: not to use such markets for the new retirement program. "A Premature Sunset for Pension Plans?" (Week in ReviewNov. 28) validates their wisdom for worrying about market risk.

Even the use of bonds can create difficulties because they fluctuate in value (particularly if demand grows)and companies can go bankrupt.

In "Vast Borrowing Seen in Altering Social Security" (front pageNov. 28)President Bush seems willing to forcibly march workers into securities markets. Enamored of privatizationhe is willing for workers to run the risks this entails.

Social Security has the lowest costs and the greatest security. It requires no Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Accounting games artificially increasing profits are not possible. Benefits also continue during downturns and serve to dampen them.

 966,  2013, a, Eleven partners at the law firm Bingham McCutchen who worked in the firm’s highly regarded securities-enforcement practice resigned on Monday to join Sidley & Austin.

Among those departing Bingham are Susan L. Merrillthe former head of enforcement at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authorityand Neal E. Sullivanthe head of the practice group. The group represents Wall Street banks and accounting firms in a variety of government investigations and regulatory matters.

Reached late MondayClaire Papanastasioua spokeswoman for Binghamconfirmed the moveand said that the firm wished the lawyers well. Carter G. Phillipsthe co-chairman of Sidley’s executive committeedid not immediately return a request for comment.

Lateral moves by partners at large corporate law firms have become commonplacebut 11 partners leaving a firm en masseespecially from such a prominent practiceis unusual.

The departures are a blow to the Boston-based Binghama 1,000-lawyer firm known for its securities-enforcement workrepresenting financial services firms before a range of government agenciesincluding the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Given the ever-changing regulatory landscape in Washington and on Wall Streetit is an especially lucrative practice area for law firms.

Bingham still has about 20 partners its securities-enforcement practiceas well as dozens of others in its securities group. They include Christopher Coxthe former S.E.C. chairmanwho practices corporate law out of the firm’s office in Costa MesaCalif.

The firm made a big splash three years ago when it hired Ms. Merrillthe former enforcement chief of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authoritya private entity that regulates Wall Street. Ms. Merrillwho works out of New Yorkwas previously a partner for a decade at Davis Polk & Wardwell.

“Susan is a recognized leader in the securities field,” Jay S. Zimmermanchairman at Binghamsaid at the time. “Her arrival to Bingham exemplifies our investment and commitment to building the strongest securities team and advising clients in the most complex mattersnationally and globally.”

Also leaving with Ms. Merrill and Mr. Sullivan is Herbert F. Janick IIIa former senior member of the enforcement division at the S.E.C. and general counsel of UBS Financial Services.

The departures come a few months after another senior partner in Bingham’s securities-enforcement practiceGeoffrey F. Aronowleft the firm to become general counsel at the S.E.C.

Mr. Aronow and Ms. Merrill had recently handled several of the firm’s prominent securities enforcement casesincluding the representation of Christine Serwinskithe former chief financial officer of the North American arm of MF Globalthe brokerage firm led by Jon Corzine that collapsed in 2011.
 4005,  1996, a, With the Rev. Al Sharpton and two other black ministers sittingat his invitationin a front pew of St. Patrick's CathedralJohn Cardinal O'Connor yesterday denounced the apparent racism behind the burning of black churches in the South and asked Catholics to aid in the rebuilding of the destroyed houses of worship.

"The black church is the ultimate treasure for the black people," the Cardinal saiddescribing it as a refuge during the time of slavery and an enduring beacon of hope. "To strike at that church is to strike at their pearl."

The Cardinal delivered an impassioned message that racism has no place in Christianitywhich he said celebrates the shared humanity of all people. "We are truly one body of Christ," he said. "If we don't know thatif we don't accept thatif we don't believe thatwe have nothing."

More than three dozen Southern churches with predominantly black or integrated congregations have burned in the last 18 months. About a dozen people have been arrested in connection with the firesand some have been determined to be accidental.

 4331,  1994, a, A drug commonly given to transplant patients offers the first new treatment in 40 years for victims of severe ulcerative colitis and can often spare them removal of their colonsa study has found.

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic bowel inflammation that results in bloody diarrhea and other symptoms. When steroids fail to stop the disease in a severe casedoctors almost always have to remove the patient's colon.

The study showed that the transplant drugcyclosporinewas effective in people with severe ulcerative colitis who had not responded to steroid drugsthe last medicine introduced for severe forms of the disease.

The studyled by Dr. Simon Lichtiger and conducted at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and the University of Chicagois being published on Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine.
 4158,  1995, a, Glenn Burkea former outfielder for the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Oakland Athletics who was the first major league baseball player to publicly acknowledge his homosexualitydied Tuesday at Fairmont Hospital in San LeandroCalif. He was 42.

The cause was complications from AIDSsaid Pamela Pittsthe A's director of baseball administration.

Burke played in the majors for four and a half seasonsbatting .237 and stealing 35 bases. But he left the game at the age of 27 in 1980 becausehe saidtoo many people in baseball condemned his sexuality. "Prejudice drove me out of baseball sooner than I should have," Burke said in an interview with The New York Times last year. "But I wasn't changing."

He was hospitalized early last year when it was determined that he had AIDS.

In 1987his right leg and foot were shattered when he was hit by a car in San Francisco.

 5775,  1985, a, Off scree this red-blooded American hero seems no larger than life -5-foot-10-inches and 167 pounds. Butohis he in shape. He said he spends three hours every morning working out with his stunt men in a gymnasium in his home in Rolling Hills EstatesCalif.''to maintain a certain youthful appearance.'' The workouts have not been in vainjudging from the impressive figure he cuts in tight blue jeans and a red plaid cowboy shirt. He has longish blond hair with a fringe of bangs flopping over his foreheada blond mustache and a blond beard. Underneath all the hair he bears a somewhat craggy resemblance to Robert Redford.

Why does he think he's become so popular with audiences? ''Wellmy films do deal with certain positive things,'' he said. ''The endings are always positive. I think a lot of people are tired of depressingboring films. I think they like to feel good at the end of a film. One of the biggest thrills of my life came when I went to a theater to see 'Missing in Action,' and all the people stood up and applauded at the end. That's when my character brings some P.O.W.'s he's just rescued to a conference in Saigonwhere the politicians are saying there aren't any more prisoners of war.''

Talk like that brings forth memories of John Wayne anbd Charles Bronsonas well as Sylvester Stallone as Rambo. Asked if he's as patriotic as the characters he has playedMr. Norris crosses his left footshod in a gray ostrich-skin cowboy bootover his right knee and replies: ''I am a conservativea real flag wavera big Ronald Reagan fan. I'm not so much a Republican or Democrat; I go more for the man himself. Ronald Reagan says what he thinkshe's not afraid to speak his mindeven if he may be unpopular. I want a strong leader and he is a strong leader. And ever since he has been in office there has been a more positivepatriotic feeling in this country.''

Mr. Norris said he thought there was a big difference between ''Missing in Action'' and Mr. Stallone's recent ''Rambo: First Blood Part II,'' in which Rambo also rescues some prisoners of war. ''I'm not quite as anti-Government as Rambo is,'' he said. ''When the helicopter comes to rescue Rambo and the American M.I.A.and then leaves them strandedI found that unrealistic. There is not an American pilot alive who would leave them there. They'd have to shoot me to stop me from picking them upbecause I'd be dead inside if I didn't.''

He added that he had made ''Missing in Action'' and its sequel''Missing in Action 2: The Beginning,'' as a tribute to his younger brotherWielandwho died in Vietnam in 1970 while leading a squad of soldiers on patrol in the jungle. ''Vietnam was a tragic mistake,'' he said. ''If you don't want to win the battledon't get involved.''

Mr. Norrisborn Carlos Ray Norrissaid he grew up under the influence of the movies of John Waynewhom he regarded as his ''substitute father'' after his own Cherokee fatheran alcoholicleft the family's home in RyanOkla.when he was 10. His Irish-English mother later moved the family of three boys to TorranceCalif.

 948,  2013, a, Dick Cavett on his career in show businessand more.

Wellhere we are again. Oscar has come and gone.

Words to gladden the heart. E’en sofair warning. This will be about Oscar. I won’t be hurt if you decide to read something else.

My problem with Oscar always begins with the first utterance of those dread words“I’d like to thank….” My hands involuntarily reach for the Bayer bottle and a Tum.

When they come to their senses and make me commissar of the Oscar showI promise you this: anyone uttering those brain-numbing words and attempting to thank more than three people will be instantly dropped through a trapdoor.

It will be well-padded down below. No one wants anyone to get hurt.



There’ll be coffee down thereand magazines. But there will be no egress from the nice and comfortable subterranean chamber until the show has faded from the screen. No reclaiming the stageclutching what looks like a toilet-paper roll of “thank-you’s.”

Why was this fungus allowed to creep all over what used to be a lot of fun to watch?

Get ready to Google or iPad or whateveryoung folksbut there was a time before Oscar became the Festival of Thankswhen a man who went by the name Bob Hope delivered such gems as“Wellhere we are again at Oscar Night. Or as it’s known at my housePassover.”

Photo

I’m not sure I’ve recovered fully from the night the divine Julia Roberts seemed to thank all but four people in the Los Angeles phone book. They got halfway through Beethoven’s Fifthtrying to play her off.

The same question arises about Oscar that I ask myself every year about the Bowl that is allegedly Super. Why do I watch it? (O.K.this year’s game was good.)

I really need to know why we inflict such self-punishment on ourselves.

Can I say nothing nice about old Osky? I can. They doin one area at leastseem to have given me less and less reason to mutter aloud“Will they never learn?” I’m talking about those dreadfulinvariably bombing two-person “comedy” bits thatover the yearsthey’ve saddled the presenters with. They are blessedly fewerbut still.

You know the ones I mean.

“HiJan. Saythat’s some dress you’re wearing.” (Delivered while staring straight out front by a guy who seems to be wearing a tux for the first time. And welded to the prompterwhich always seems to be a yard too far away. The dialogue is of pure wood.)

Jan: “OhthanksTom. I’m so glad you care for my dressas I made it myself at my home.”

Tom: Wow. (Delivered without emphasis or energy.) WellI sure hope you make it home still in it. (Strangled mercy-laugh.)

I’m sorry. My made-up example is farfar too funny to be typical of the genrebut you know what I mean.

And I’m sorry to say that some very good actorswhen dipping a first-time toe into comedyneed to be givenas foreign actors do“line readings.” In orderthat isto prevent the “That was no ladythat was MY wife” problem.

How old an oldie must you have to be to remember that there was a time before innocent awards viewersjust looking for a little funwere subjected to these paralyzing paroxysms of imaginary gratitude?

ImaginaryI saybecause what is it all really saying?

It’s saying. “I really don’t deserve this award. Nono. It’s not for me at all. Not at all. It really belongs to a lot of people…”

Like hell. You gave the performancethey didn’t. The false modesty is thick and of high viscosity.

Here’s the kind of thing you endure. Effusions of thanks and salivating affection for such household names as:

Henny Goldfarb. And Janey Dillman … and Clyde Whale. … and Sneed Hearn … and Tommmy best buddy… and the incredible Eldridge Endrubber … andof courseAlvira Winkle … and deardear Conchita forwelljust about everything … and the girls in the Huppman officeand darling “Chummy…” you know who you are. Ohand Andremy masseur [oddlypronounced “massooss”] … ohand at the Morris AgencySchmul Yamazaki … and Cheech Bolandermy neighbor who never fails tolikewater my plantsohand Floyd forwelljust for being Floyd … and for undying affection when I need it mostdearest Pootie and Tootiemy two Shih Tzus … and of course a very special Mom.. and Dearest Dadwho I know is looking down on us right now [from whereup in the flies?] andohdon’t play me offI’ve got one more list somewhere here. Ahyesand … [a shot rings out] …

A fantasy? An exaggeration? Just ask yourself.

A radical idea I knowbut couldn’t Sneed and Eldridge and that whole lot be thanked off-camerawith a nice note and maybe a modest gift or two? A caringly wrapped case of Tootsie Rolls and some nice hollyhocks?

Here is a typical Oscar “thank you” from the good old daysan artifact from a far-offhappier time before it occurred to anyone to bore us to idiocy with a list of unheard of strangers. Somewhere on the Net I found an acceptance speech by the great David Niven. It went:

“And the winner is … DAVID NIVEN!” (Affectionate ovation.)

Niven: “Thank you. I’m so weighed down with good luck amulets and charms from friends that I was barely able to struggle my way up here onto the stage. I’m very grateful.” (EXITS)

Where are the Nivens of yesteryear?

A shamein a waythat he didn’t say morebecause I recall Niven as a scintillating guest on an early show of mine. His talk simply sparkled and was compared favorably — presumably by some rather elderly people — to that of Oscar Wilde.

Nobody that year read a gratitude laundry list. Though a helpful friend reminds me that Greer Garsonin 1943established the all-time record for speech length. When she got hometwo of her children had grown up during it.

I confess I still retain some affection for Oscar. I know the reviews weren’t very good this year and I know it’s easy to kick Oscar when he’s down.

But then when is he up?
 2211,  2006, a, Local people are irked all the more that the final decision will be taken in SantiagoChilenearly 2,500 miles away. Easter Islandknown as Rapa Nui in the local Polynesian language of the same namehas been part of Chile since 1888with Spanish as its language of government.

The author of the casino plan is Pedro Rirarokoa Rapa Nui businessman and landowner whose interests include a hotel and travel agency. He was on the Chilean mainland lobbying for the projectin which he has Chilean partners who already own a casinoand did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Photo

But the mayor herePedro Edmundshas endorsed the plan. He argues that the benefits of a casino would far outweigh its potential adverse effects. "I welcome any project that would develop Rapa Nui societyand this is one that would create 150 jobs that I don't have today," he said in an interview. "Plusa chunk of the profits and sales would stay here on the island and give me more money to build roads and maybe afford to buy a dialysis unit for the hospital."

The casino project comes at a delicate moment in the island's complicated and turbulent historywith the Chilean Congress considering a "special statute" that would grant political autonomy to Easter Island. That legislationwhich is expected to be approved this yearwould give the island's government much greater control over land use and finances.

Easter Island acquired its name when a Dutch vessel landed on that Sunday in 1722. Scientists were curious about the mysterious moai from the beginningbut initially there was little interest otherwise because the island was so remote and had no natural resources to exploit. But in the 19th centuryraids by slave ships from Peru carried off nearly 1,000 Rapa Nuiincluding the island's kingto work in guano mines there. An international campaign freed a handful of survivorswho returned here infected with diseases that reduced the populationmore than 10,000 at its peakto 111 people.

The survivors sought protection from Peru's rivalChilebut for many years thereafter the island was little more than a sheep farm. Residents acquired Chilean citizenship only in 1966after protests against their second-class status and what they saw as the arrogance of their Chilean Navy overseers. "This island was run like a ship," said Sergio Rapua Rapa Nui archaeologist who in the 1980's became the island's first civilian and native governor. "Everyone was in the navyand if you were a Rapa Nuithen you were two steps down from a sailor."

In recent yearsthoughwith Chile democratically ruled and increasingly prosperousthe national government has tried to make amends. On a per capita basis"More is spent in Rapa Nui than in any municipality in Chile," Claudio Agurtoan Interior Ministry officialsaid in an interview in Santiago. But local residents complain that developmentwith tourism in the leadhas gotten out of hand. Since the return of democracy in 1990the number of visitors has swelled to nearly 45,000 last year from less than 6,000.

The national airlineLAN Chilenow flies here almost dailyand there are also charter flights and cruise ships. But most of the profits from those flights go to the Chilean mainlandresidents sayas do revenues from many hotels. In additionmany "continentals," as newcomers from mainland Chile are calledhave settled hereattracted by jobsand married locals. The result is a new class of residents of mixed ethnicity and growing concerns about Rapa Nui's cultural identity.

The influx of outsiders has strained public services. The island's electricitywater and garbage collection systems are bucklingofficials sayand the capacity of schools and hospitals is taxed. "We're heading for another collapse if we don't learn how to take better care of ourselves," said Ema Tukithe local representative of the National Indigenous Councilreferring to an earlier breakdown of traditional society that took place in the 1600's. "People say this is a paradisebut the changes have been so rapid and so brusque that I fear we may have already gone past our natural limits."

A few people favor complete independencea position the majority regards as impractical because "we don't have the mechanisms or the resources to survive on our own," as Ms. Tuki put it. Another groupmostly young people known as "los yorgos," has distanced itself by retreating to the hills and living a more traditional life. Dressed in camouflage and colorful bandanastheir long hair plaited or flowingthey evoke the spirit of hippies or Rastafarians.

"We want to live in our own manner on our own islandnot bound by the outside world and what it says," said Kiri Icka Pakaratia self-proclaimed yorgo. "Things have gone wrong here because the Chileans are in chargenot the Rapa Nui. Do you know what it is like living on your own islandbut controlled by others? It's like being in prison."

 2852,  2003, a, To the Editor:

The easiest way to deal with the flow of illegal immigrants (editorialNov. 26) is to make them legal. Let Mexicans enter the United States to work at those jobs that we Americans are too proud to do. The government would save moneybusinesses would make money and work would get done.

Mexicans are good people. They are excellent workers and hard-working ones at that. Mexicans will get the job done and do it well.

Workers of every sort built this land of ours. It will be workers who will build it anew. If Americans aren't up to the taskperhaps the Mexican worker is.

 3130,  2001, a, Ever since a knife-wielding man killed eight children at an elementary school near Osaka on June 8schools across Japan have wasted little time adopting security measures that until the stabbing would have been unthinkable in a country of little violence.

School officials have locked gatesposted guardsorganized parent patrolsinstalled cameras and enrolled teachers in self-defense courses.

Some schools are even arming teachers with weapons like ear-splitting noise alarmslong Y-shaped poles (often used by the police to subdue suspects) and canisters of tear gas.

Hideki Matsuzakithe mayor of Urayasua town east of Tokyosaid''It might look dangerous for schools to have such devicesbut what should not have happened did actually happen in Ikedaand the city government should consider concrete measures to keep children safe.'' Urayasu plans to distribute tear-gas canisters to 42 schools.

 4427,  1993, a, A group of former employees at Supercomputer Systems Inc. said on Saturday that they were trying to raise $20 million to $30 million to save the company.

Supercomputer Systemsbased in Eau ClaireWis.closed operations last Monday after it lost financing from I.B.M..

The group is working separately from Steve S. Chenthe company's founder who started it in 1988 after leaving Cray Research Inc. At a news conference last weekMr. Chen said he had a working prototype that was the world's fastest single-processor computer.

The International Business Machines Corporation had originally planned to market the Supercomputer Systems machinebut on Tuesday it plans to introduce an alternative supercomputer technology developed by a group of its own engineers. That systemto be called SP-1chains together up to 64 microprocessors to reach supercomputer speeds.

Mrs. Alma town council member who had previously run programs for elderly residentsknew that a group of local retirees were on a ferry trip to Tallinn. When it became clear that it was their vessel that had capsized and sunkshe summoned up the will to look at the list of their names. Six of the first eight names she saw were friends. Of the 56 people on the list -- all still missing and presumed dead -- she knew 20 well.

"I was reading the list and just crying," she said. "It was hard to be of much help to others."

In a country that has been knocked off its bearings by the loss of the ferry Estonia and more than 800 of its passengersmost of them Swedesno town has taken a harder blow than Norrkopinga placid port city of 120,000 people 100 miles south of Stockholm.

The 56 travelers from Norrkopingincluding 14 married coupleswere nearly all grandmothers and grandfatherslongtime residents with relatives and friends all over town. Bengt Malmstrom was known to all as the former chairman of the local health authority. Arne Engberg had long organized a popular bicycle race.

 5568,  1986, a, DAYLIGHT lingers longer now in the evenings but rare is the city gardener who finds enough time for this month's activities in the garden. May is the planting month and every minute spent in the garden will reap rewards this summer.

Unless yours is an unusually sunny spotdon't expect this year's tulipsdaffodils or hyacinths to re-bloom next year; in the city's shaded canyons these plants are unreliable as repeaters and are best dug up and discarded after flowering.

Replant empty spaces with summer bulbscorms and rootstocks. For sunny rooftop planters use the dwarf forms of dahliascannas and gladioluses whose colorfultallflower stalks add contrasting vertical accents. Also notable is chinkericheea lily relative that bears long-lasting white blossoms on 18-inch stemsor the easily grown montbretiaan iris relative with wiry-stemmed scarlet or gold-toned flowersor crinumwhich has tallfunnel-shaped blooms and narrow leaves.

In yards with light shadesummer bulbs include agapanthuswith its tallwhite or purple flower globesthe calla lilies that have cone-shaped bloomsor the fragrantsummer daffodilhymenocallis. Most are available for planting now from city garden centers including the Farm and Garden Nursery2 Avenue of the Americas (White Street)212-431-3577; mail and telephone orders will be accepted until June by John Sheepers Inc.63 Wall StreetNew YorkN.Y. 10005212-422-1177.

 5504,  1987, a, Soon the Hawksnow calling themselves the Bandwere at work on an album of their own''Music From Big Pink.'' That album and its followup''The Band,'' introduced Robbie Robertson's songwritingwhich combined a cinematic approach to imagery with a rare insight into American history and myth. Some of his songs were portraits of ordinary Americans caught up in changes they could only begin to understandlike the Southerners facing the defeat of the Confederacy in ''The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.'' Other songs told tall tales in backwoods vernacular; some were stark stories of guilt and redemption with a vivid frontier ambiance. But as career pressures mountedthe Band's records began to seem more calculatedand by the mid-70'sthe Band's stage shows were beginning to seem cut and dried. Mr. Robertson decided it was time to go out with a bang. The result was ''The Last Waltz,'' the concert in San Francisco that reunited the band with Bob Dylan and other musical associates and became one of the finest rock concert filmslovingly directed by Martin Scorsese.

The major influence on Mr. Robertson's re-emergence has been his rediscovery of his own American Indian roots. The album begins with deepreverberating tom-tomsand several of the songs address Indian-related themes.

''My mother was a Mohawkborn and raised on a reservation,'' Mr. Robertson noted''and when I was a kidshe would take me there to visit her relatives. I used to get this indescribable feeling from those visitsand now I feel like it's time for me to deal with that American Indian element.''

''Robbie Robertson'' is an eclectic and sometimes startling record. The drums one hears at the beginning are filtered through atmospheric keyboard textures that sound distinctly like Peter Gabriel's workand in factMr. Gabriel and his band do appear on several tracks. By working with artists as identifiable as Mr. Gabriel and U2Mr. Robertson risks subsuming his own identity. But as the album progresseshe cannily combines these familiar pop sounds with song formsvocal inflectionsand guitar sounds rooted in his earlier work. The soaringlyrical ''Showdown at Big Sky,'' for exampleis strongly reminiscent of the Band's best years. And the two songs Mr. Robertson recorded with U2 in Ireland don't sound like U2 or the Band; they have a musical identityand an excitementall their own.

The lyrics are intensely personal throughoutwhether Mr. Robertson is writing about his experiences as a teen-age rocker exploring the American South (''Somewhere Down the Crazy River'') or coming to terms with his American Indian heritage. Sometimes the writing seems wordyoverwroughtbut this effect only underscores the album's evident sincerity. After keeping these songs and feelings bottled up for a decadeMr. Robertson seems to be letting them out all at onceand the song formats he has come up withingenious as they are at timescan scarcely hold back the flood.
 1569,  2010, a, Andrew Councill for The New York Times

Of course older people worrylegitimatelyabout falling. But can exaggerated anxiety about falling — even if physiological tests show your risk to be low — increase the probability that you’ll actually fall?

A team at Neuroscience Research Australia has found that it can. Converselyolder people who are physically at high riskbut don’t perceive much dangerfall less often than would be expected.

Mind over matteras someone once said.

The studypublished in the British medical journal BMJtracked 500 Sydney residents (average age: 78) who agreed to undergo a series of medicalphysiological and neuropsychological tests. Most participants could accurately assess their odds of fallingbut about a third were off the mark. They felt either more or less vulnerable than their strengthbalancereaction time and other physical characteristics would indicate.

Eleven percentwhom the research team dubbed the “anxious” grouphad a higher perceived risk than was physiologically warranted. Twenty percentlabeled “stoics,” actually were at risk physiologically — but didn’t rate their risk as high.

Followed over a yearthe anxious folks did fall more than the group as a whole: 40 percent suffered multiple or injurious falls. But only about a third of the stoics felldespite their higher physical risk.

Psychological differences appear to affect people’s self-assessmentssaid Stephen Lordan applied physiologist who was a member of the research team. “These anxious people were more likely to be depressedto have restricted their activitiesand it looks as though these factors feed on each other,” he said.

“People who are fearful do lessand that leads to deconditioningto a loss of strength and balance,” he explained. Increasingly phobic about fallingsometimes unwilling to leave their homes“they become preoccupied with the possibility. They catastrophize.” The stoic sortsby contrastmaintained more positive attitudes and more active lives despite their physical problems.

Old people do fall frequentlyof courseand they’re right to be concerned about minimizing the hazard. “It’s realand the consequences are real,” Dr. Lord said.

But excessive caution that leads to a diminished lifewith ruptured social connectionshas consequencestoo. Fear of falling is treatableboth physically and psychologicallyDr. Lord says. Regular exercise programs can help older people maintainor regainbalance and strengthwhile cognitive behavioral therapyfocused and usually short-termcan reduce anxiety. The Australian team’s next project is to learn more about using these interventions.

“The message isn’t: don’t worry about falls,” Dr. Lord said. It’s that while fears can cause people to enter a downward spiral“you can also spiral up.”

 3739,  1998, a, Stocks had their worst trading session in two months yesterdayas waves of profit taking swept through the market.

The declines were broad basedfrom computer and drug makers to banks and financial service companies and highly speculative Internet-related stocks.

And it occurred on a day when a sharp drop in commodity prices sent bond prices soaring and interest rates sharply lower. By late in the dayyields on the Government's benchmark 30-year bond stood at 5.07 percent.

By the close of tradingthe Dow Jones industrial average was down 216.53 pointsor 2.3 percentto 9,116.55. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 28.70 pointsor 2.4 percentto 1,163.63. And the Nasdaq Composite indexwhich is loaded with computer-related sharesincluding a number of Internet companiesfell 66.90 pointsor 3.3 percentto 1,949.54. Nearly twice as many stocks fell as rose on the New York Stock Exchange.

 4258,  1994, a, Family historians say Robert Edwards was descended from a Welsh songwriter whoas befits an epicwas part of the 16th-century court of Henry VIII of England. But Mr. Edwards himself was a man of the 18th century. One published account held that he was the son of a colonial shipbuilding magnate. Another said he was a farmer who had emigrated from Wales. (This persistent Welsh connection led nearly 500 Welshmen to assert in 1954 that they owned lower Manhattan.)

What is less in doubtthough still not incontrovertiblewere Mr. Edwards's activities on behalf of the British monarchy. The clan's historians say Mr. Edwards was a piratelicensed by the Crown to plunder Spanish ships in the New World.

At some pointmost accounts agreethe English throne awarded him a parcel of what is now lower Manhattan. Around 1780 Mr. Edwards diedby some accounts at sea with a dagger clenched between his teeth.

As the story goesat some point Mr. Edwards leased his tract to two brothersJohn and Georgefor 99 years.

When the lease expired in 1877Mrs. Foore's group saysa provision of the lease called for the property to be divided among eight heirs. But it never was. Latter-day heirs have long maintained that Mr. Edwards's immediate heirssix brothers and a sisterwere either unaware of their inheritance or unable to secure it. Either waythe lessors stole the Edwards propertythe 20th-century claimants assert.

Many family members say they have documents that supportif not provetheir claim. They offer willsmapsletters and what they assert are copies of the 99-year lease. But the original has never been foundleaving open the question of just what these copies are copies of; other documents have been found to be either not properly signed or not legally recorded.

Yet even if the original lease were to be foundit might not matter a whit.

Three timesmost recently in the early 1950'sFederal and New York State courts have ruled that the 15-year statute of limitations on such property claims had long since expired. In 1950a committee of the State Assembly rejected a bill to create a commission to investigate the Edwards claim. Deceived by Charlatans
 4383,  1994, a, After the hearingprosecutors released a list of the items found in Mr. Duran's truck that provided insights into the world of a man known to his neighbors as Franka quietunobtrusive father of a 5-year-old boy. Some officials said they had begun to suspect that Mr. Duran might have been drawn to the ultraconservativecitizen militia movements that have sprung up in several Western states.

In a search of the truck early Sunday at the headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Investigationagents found eight compact disks31 cassette tapesa dozen books4 newspapers and 9 magazines. None of the individual items were identifiedbut officials described the material as mix of New Age music tapesoccult literature and several pornographic magazines.

They also found camping gearincluding extra clothingtwo pairs of shoestwo sleeping bagsa black tarpaulincompressed fuel packetsropetoolsa fishing roda pair of medic's shearsa machetea knife sharpener and a stuffed animal.

Agents also discovered weapons-related equipmentincluding a shotguna gun magazinea gun bagshotgun shells and 20-round boxes of ammunition for the rifle they said was used to shoot at the White House. They also recovered a shoulder holstera gun-cleaning kit and four used targets. The agents also found 22 Atropine injectorssyringes filled with premeasured doses of medication used by soldiers as antidote to poison gas. They also found two units of what appeared to be a drugand they were still trying to determine what it might be used for and whether Mr. Duran had taken it.

At the Pentagon todayofficials released more details about Mr. Duran's troubled military career. He enlisted in the Army in February 1988 and was trained as a medic. For more than two yearshe served as a battalion medic in the 25th Infantry Division based at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii.

On Aug. 91990after a night of drinking at a bowling alley on postMr. Duran and a group of other soldiers began arguing with several civilians. When Mr. Duran got in his automobile to leavethe records showhe drove straight at the group of civiliansstruck one woman and roared off. Laterhe was stopped by military policewho charged him with drunken drivingaggravated assaultdrunken and disorderly conduct and leaving the scene of accident.

It was for this incident that Mr. Duran was dishonorably discharged at court-martial and sentenced to five years at the military prison at Fort LeavenworthKan. He served two and one-half years of his sentencewhich was later suspendedand he was released on Sept. 31993.
 2226,  2006, a, The grisly death of real estate developer Andrew Kissel has gripped the wealthy community of GreenwichConn.where he livedand brought back memories of the highly publicized death of his brotherwho had been a prominent banker for Goldman Sachs and then Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong.

In this week’s cover storyNew York Magazine recounts the history of the Kissel familyoffering a long and sordid tale of greedlust and fraud.

The bankerRobert Kisselwas murdered by his wife. And early last monthhis brother Andrew was found dead after being charged with fraud in three states. Recriminations continue among the surviving family members.

Perhaps the most tragic aspect of the story is the fate of the five children at the center of it all. As portrayed in the articlethey were used as pawns in an ongoing game of petty squabbling among the adults they know best. Two of them lost one parentwhile three lost a parent and saw another go to prison. One unknowingly fed her father narcotics in a milkshake so that her mother could bludgeon him to death.

 2361,  2005, a, DumbfoundedI replied"That would be me."

A few weeks after that I was in another group of scientific eminencesthis one at a luncheon at the Waldorf. The spokeswoman for the group that organized the event introduced me to one of the group's most eminent guestsa leading figure in American science policy.

"Oh," he said kindly but abstractedly"you work for The New York Times. How nice." The spokeswoman explainedagainthat I was the newspaper's science editor. "An editor," he said. "How nice." The woman explained againbut again he could not take it in. "Ohscience," he said"How nice." At this point the spokeswoman lost patience. She grabbed the honored guest by both shouldersput her face a few inches away from his and shouted at him -- "She's it!"

Not long afterI answered the office telephoneand the callera (male) scientistasked to speak to several of my colleaguesall male and all out. "May I help you?" I inquired. "Nonono," he replied. "I don't want to talk to youI want to talk to someone important!"

Even at the timeI could laugh at these experiences. After allI was a grown-up person who could take care of herself. (I informed the caller that all the men he wanted to talk to worked for meand then I hung up. As for Dr. Twerpyhe should know that he was not the first man to refer to me professionally as "that little girl." I reported on the doings of the other one until he was indicted.)

But the memories of the seventh grader are still not funny. Neither is it amusing to reflect on what happened to a college friend who was the only student in her section to pass linear algebrathe course the math department typically used to separate the sheep from the mathematical goats. Talk about stigma! She changed her major to American civilization.

Another friendgraduating as a math majorwas advised not to bother applying for a graduate research assistantship because they were not given to women. She eventually earned a doctorate in mathbut one of her early forays into the job market ended abruptly when she was told she should stay home with her husband rather than seek employment out of town.

Experiences like hers -- the outrightoutloud dashing of a promising mathematician's hopes simply because of her sex -- are no longer the norm. At least I hope not. But they are enoughby themselvesto tell us why there are relatively few women in the upper ranks of science and mathematics today.
 2811,  2003, a, To the Editor:

Re ''Prosecutors Fight DNA Use for Exoneration'' (front pageAug. 29): The arguments used in court papers by a Florida prosecutor to discount the impact of DNA evidence in the case of a convicted rapist are disturbing.

The interest in ''finality'' that he cites as a reason for the conviction to stand shouldin factencourage him to seek the truthas should his concern for the victim.

Evidence that was used to convict a defendant does not become meaningless when DNA testing shows that it no longer fits the prosecution's case. Shouldn't a jury in a retrial decide whether or not a verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt can be reached without it?

The prosecutor appears to feel that the inconvenience of another trial far outweighs the inconvenience of continuing to imprison an innocent man. Our justice system becomes both ineffective and dangerous once the actual guilt or innocence of those we lock away becomes irrelevant.
 4273,  1994, a, NOT everyone is a born gardenerbut some of us pretend. So I visited the hardware store to select seeds for my suburban garden andafter consulting the almanac on a shelf for informationchose peeperstulips and helicopters. Taking the envelopes to the gardenI planted and watered the seeds and sped up the calendar so that each day took 10 seconds to pass. For this was a computer gameor simulationForever Growing Gardenby Media Vision of FremontCalif.

The cat watched from inside the house through a windowand soon a bluebird flew over to taunt it. A gopher also surfacedbut when I tried to catch him I caught a skunk instead. Finallytwo beautiful peepers started to pop throughbut as of this moment (it is Aug. 2; whoopsnow it's Aug. 3) there is no sign of the tulips or helicoptersthe latter being fantasy plants.

The program offers three settings: the suburban flower gardena vegetable patch or the grounds of a medieval castle. Depending on the choicethe hardware store will offer appropriate seeds. Afteror ifyou have successfully grown the flowers or vegetablesyou will be able to harvest the vegetables and take them to market to sellcut the flowers and arrange them in a vaseor trim the castle's hedges into Scissorshands patterns. Gardens can be saved on disk and reopened laterand there are surprises hidden here and there.

Forever Growing Garden comes as a CD-ROM. The one disk works with PC's running Windows 3.1 or most Macintoshes running System 7.0 or later. The suggested list price is $39.95.
 4234,  1995, a, With his baseball cap turned backward and a silver earring bobbing as he strummed a few chords on an air guitar29-year-old Philip Weck was not your typical casino customer. But then againthis was not your typical Vegas hot spot: music by Pearl Jam pumped through the sound system and an electronic board above a bank of slot machines counted the diminishing number of acres of rain forest left on mother earth.

"It's more like a party than a casino," Mr. Weck observedtaking a break from a post-midnight romp at the roulette table in the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino here. "It's more familiar to people like me than the Strip."

You say you want a revolution? By most standardsthe Hard Rock Hotel and Casinowhich opened with high-decibel pomp last springis less than radical. An affiliate of the Hard Rock Cafesit bills itself as the spot in Las Vegas for people who do not like Las Vegasbut it is ultimately a place to eatdrink and gamblewith plenty of buxom cocktail waitresses.

When it openedthere was only a hope that a younger crowd would discover Vegasand that if it didthe newcomers would spend freely. Now there are answers to both questions. The hotel says that it turns away as many as 300 people seeking reservations every weekendand that the Hard Rock's revenues are running more than 50 percent ahead of projections.

 5799,  1985, a, The trustees of the Museum of the American Indian have asked the New York State Supreme Court to clarify the rights and obligations of the museum regarding the offer by the Texas computer executive H. Ross Perot to invest $70 million in the museum if it moves to Texas.

In a petition filed yesterday with the courtthe museum's trustees asked for a hearing on Nov. 20.

For more than a decadethe museum has sought to relocate from its current address at 155th Street and Broadwaywhere it says the facilities are inadequate to display and store its collection.

The American Museum of Natural History has offered to help the museum relocate in a building that would adjoin itbut the Indian museum has rejected the offersaying that it could not retain its independence in such a merger.

Attorney General Robert Abrams of New York has said that the trust agreement of the museumestablished in 1916requires that the museum remain in New York State. He has said that he will oppose any effort by the museum to get court approval to move from the state.

The anecdote from "McNamara's Old Bronx" about the pianist Ignace Jan Paderewski dropping in impulsively on a Bronx piano teacher (after hearing a Chopin nocturne emitting from an open window)and giving the astonished woman an impromptu free lesson (F.Y.I.April 24)reminds me of a similar event many years ago:

Mischa Elmanthe legendary violinistwas notorious for visitingunannouncedManhattan stringed-instrument dealers and repair shops. One afternoon in Rembert Wurlitzer's 42nd Street storeI was trying out a violin to borrow for an audition. No sooner had I begun the Glazounov concertowhen Elman popped in.

I frozebut he gestured to keep playing. Suddenly he cried"Nono," grabbed the fiddle from meand played the entire first movement.

It was a somewhat one-sided lessonsince I didn't get to play another note.

But I could not resist telling my fellow Juilliard students that I had a lesson with Elman.

AT&Tthe second largest American phone carrieron Saturday said it would offer a cheaper phone plan for families with multiple devices. It was AT&T’s latest big move amid intense competition coming from rivalsespecially T-Mobile US.

Under the new planAT&T is offering families unlimited minutesunlimited texting and 10 gigabytes of data to share among themselves. The price for monthly service depends on the number of phone lines in the family. A family of two can pay $130 a montha family of three can pay $145a family of four can pay $160 and any additional line after that will cost an extra $15.

Photo

But then there’s the fine print with the new family plan. Customers who are brand-new to AT&T either have to sign up for AT&T’s Next programwhich allows the customer to spread payments of the device over up to 26 months; bring their own device; or pay for the full price of the phone. For examplefor the cheapest iPhone 5Sa customer can pay the full $650 for the phoneor pay $25 a month for 26 months on top of the cost of the new family planor bring his or her own iPhone 5S (assuming it is compatible with AT&T’s network).

So the new family plan may be more expensive than some of AT&T’s other plans if each family member chooses a high-end smartphone. But it can be a good deal for families where at least a few people — like the children — choose cheaper smartphones.

When existing AT&T customers switch to the new family planthey won’t have to immediately jump to the Next program or pay the full cost of the phone. But once their contract is up and they want to upgrade to a new devicethey will have to choose one of those options.

Overallthe new family plan is an aggressive offering. T-Mobile has been offering family plans with a similar structurebut it allows each family member to choose the amount of data he or she wants individually. A family of four where each person wants 2.5 gigabytes a month would cost $140 a monthnot including the monthly cost of each device.

Jan Dawsona telecom analyst for Jackdaw Researchsaid AT&T’s new family plan was a sign that it was shifting toward relying on data plans to increase its revenue.

“AT&T and Verizon will continue to try to attract new customersbut they can grow strongly by growing usage and growing the number of devices per account without necessarily adding huge numbers of new customers,” Mr. Dawson said. “That becomes all the more important as the market becomes saturated and there are few new customers to go around.”

 3951,  1996, a, In the latest move by a large corporation into New York City's troubled garbage hauling industryWaste Management Inc.the nation's biggest recycling companysaid yesterday that it had agreed to a $200 million deal to buy one of the city's largest recycling and trash-collection companies.

The acquisition comes amid a broad crackdown by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and law enforcement officials on organized crime that officials charge has controlled much of the garbage haulingdisposal and recycling industry for 50 years.

Officials said the company being acquired in the latest dealResource N.E.had not been touched by allegations of mob influence. But Waste Management executives said they would not have decided to enter the New York City market at all unless they were convinced that organized crime had loosened its grip on the waste business.

"Our decision to enter the New York market is in large part attributable to the efforts of a number of local officials to make the marketplace more competitive," said Phillip B. RooneyWaste Management's chairman.

 3393,  2000, a, To the Editor:

A Nov. 30 editorial argues against intervention by Florida's Legislaturebut it may be appropriatelegally and politicallyfor it to resolve the selection of electors. We must remember that the margin of error in counting votes is greater than the margin of victory. Alsoit is likely that the courts will not finish their work by Dec. 12when electors must be chosen.

The Legislature could act in a truly courageous fashion and appoint 12 electors favoring George W. Bush12 favoring Al Gore and 1 favoring Ralph Nader. It would have a Solomonic result that fairly represented the results in Florida and the country. It would also show the quick way to Electoral College reform.

 5762,  1985, a, On the fourth full day of campCoach Joe Walton came up with yet another variation today in his attempt to change his philosophy about coaching the Jets. For the first time so early in training campthe players worked out in shorts and T-shirts rather than long pants and heavy pads this morning. They returned to regular gear for the afternoon session.

Walton said with all the changes the team is making on defensehe had not had time to work on the nickel defense or at blitzing.

The Jets continue to be hampered by slight muscle pullswith the strong safety Russell Carter and the cornerback Bobby Jackson being the latest victims. Both missed practice this morningand although they went out on the field with the rest of the team for the afternoon session they did not do any work. ''The fast guys will have trouble with little muscle pulls,'' Walton said between practice sessions.

The coach said Joe Fieldsthe centersuffered separated ribs in Tuesday's practice and would miss the first exhibition gameAug. 10 at Giants Stadium against the Philadelphia Eagles.
 4245,  1995, a, Cards and letters and calls are making their way to the powers that be. The Rockland County Commission on Human Rightsthe Rockland County Historical Societythe Historical Society of Bergen County and various scholars have weighed in to support the tribe's petition for recognition. FinallyChief Van Dunk sayshe is getting an inkling from the tribe's lawyers that someone in the Department of the Interior might be taking the Ramapoughs seriously. "The Government realizes we're not going away," he said.

The Ramapoughs say they have been heretucked in the craggy landscape straddling the New York-New Jersey bordersince well before the border existed. The tribe traces its ancestry back 5,000 yearsto the Lenape tribe. But it has had a time proving it. Two years agothe Bureau of Indian Affairs denied the tribe's petition on the ground that their lineage could not be traced effectively.

BUT another issue is at least partly to blame: casino gambling. Political opposition to the Ramapoughs' petition grew after Federal law allowed gaming operations on tribal lands. Mr. Torricellia Democrat from Englewoodinitially supported the tribe's petition and even wrote letters on its behalf. But he changed his mindhe saidwhen he realized the Ramapoughs were "only interested in opening a casino." This despite the fact that the Ramapoughs applied for Federal recognition nine years before the Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act became law.

Even if the tribe decides to open a casino -- Mr. Van Dunk says it does not plan toalthough he would not rule it out -- should that determine whether the Government recognizes its ancestry?

New Jersey politicians know that the Atlantic City casino operators have been worried about recognition of the Ramapoughs for some time. In 1993when the tribe's petition was pendingsix members of the New Jersey Congressional delegation sent a joint letter to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitcalling the tribe's claims "dubious" and warning of the negative impact a casino in Bergen County (30 minutes from Manhattan) would have on Atlantic City.
 4985,  1990, a, About half the people with the disease never get rid of it; the liver is chronically infectedand the hundreds of functions it performsfrom producing bile to making substances that help the blood clotare impaired. One in five people with this form of hepatitis develop cirrhosisa scarring that in severe cases can lead to liver failure. A smaller number get liver cancer. And many suffer unrelenting fatigue.

Interferon's Side Effects

Most cases are caused by the recently identified hepatitis C virusbut about 15 percent are caused by unknown virusessaid Dr. Dienstag of Massachusetts General. He added that all patients with non-Anon-B hepatitis responded equally well to interferon.

Dr. Klein said interferon gave hepatitis patients their first hope. ''It was a terrible thing to say to a patient,'' he added. '' 'I know what you have and I know what the probable outcome isbut I have nothing to offer you.' Now you have something.''

Until now patients have been advised to get plenty of rest; to avoid alcoholwhich can further damage the liverand to hope the infection goes away on its own.

Last yeartwo studies involving more than 200 patients demonstrated that interferon alpha was effective in suppressing the liver infection in nearly half the patientsalthough nearly half of those suffered relapses and needed further treatment.

Dr. Alter said patients had not been followed long enough to determine whether the treatment would prevent cirrhosis or cancer. But he said that by suppressing the virus''it makes sense that you will get less scarring and less cirrhosis.''

But interferon treatment has problems of its ownresearchers said. It can produce fatiguemild to moderate hair loss and lower counts of white blood cells and plateletsleaving patients more vulnerable to infections and bleeding. Investigators are still trying to find the best dose and the best schedule to administer the drug.

Sowait: you can make an ad totally by yourself and get hits on YouTube and then get paid bylikeNike?!?!?!

Of course people went to the video originally to see that D.J.so you need a decent hook to start with. But then those viewers couldn’t have missed the swoosh. Andeven if the logo were photoshopped in laterdoesn’t the vid still function as a Nike ad? (This question was posed by buglewoodthe cool anonymous tipster who tuned me in to this whole thing.)

 85,  2019, a, LONDON — The French police searched Renault’s headquarters on Wednesdayas part of a misconduct investigation into Carlos Ghosnthe automaker’s former chairman and chief executive.

Renault confirmed the raid at the headquarters in Boulogne-Billancourtjust outside Paris. “We are fully cooperating with the authorities,” Astrid de Latudea spokeswoman for the companysaid. She declined to provide any further details about the search.

The searchwhich started in the morningwas linked to an investigation into the financing of Mr. Ghosn’s marriage reception at the Chateau of Versaillessaid Emmanuelle Lepissierthe chief administrative officer of the public prosecutor's department in Nanterrewhich is overseeing the investigation.

French news media had earlier reported that the raid was tied to the Ghosn case. Renault has referred information to prosecutors that Mr. Ghosnwho headed the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi car alliance and who was arrested in November on suspicion of financial misconductmay have misused company money to finance a lavish Marie Antoinette-themed party at Versailles in 2016 to celebrate his second marriage and his wife’s 50th birthday.
 3066,  2001, a, The United States economy grew at its slowest rate in more than five years during the final quarter of 2000as businesses abruptly cut their spending on new equipmentthe government said yesterday.

American consumers continued to increase their purchasesalbeit more slowly than earlier in the yearallowing the gross domestic product to grow at an annual pace of 1.4 percent during the quarter. Government spendingparticularly on the militaryalso rosewhile economic weakness around the globe caused foreign countries to trim their purchases of American goods.

The Commerce Department's quarterly report depicted the $10.1 trillion United States economy verging on a slowdown or a recession. Growth remained faster than it had been in the first half of 1995when the country avoided a recession and the economy then entered one of its best five-year periods in history.

But over the final three months of 2000personal consumption was the only part of the private sector that expandedand in the early weeks of this year consumer confidence has plummetedaccording to two major surveys.

 5239,  1988, a, FOR better and for worseAbbey Simon has remained throughout his long career just on the edge of the artistic spotlightmaintaining on the basis of reliable readings of the standard piano repertory a reputation unaffected by shifting musical tastes. Mr. Simon plays in a fluidpolishedself-effacing wayand his performances can be counted on to provide at least reasonable satisfaction and pleasure. They fall into no particular interpretative camp but pursue their own sensiblestraightforward path.

If this sounds like tepid praiseit is not intended that wayalthough Mr. Simon occasionally plays in a manner that leaves a listener puzzled and disappointed. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of his Carnegie Hall debutthe pianist returned there on Sunday evening and presented a program of works by BeethovenMendelssohnChopinRachmaninoff and Ravel -bringing to them all nothing less than the note-perfectintelligently crafted interpretations for which he is knownyet investing none of them with the sort of individualistic twist that would transform his performances into distinctivememorable experiences.

To his considerable creditMr. Simon conceives works in largesweeping archesnever allowing himself to become bogged down by the smallfussy inflections that might disrupt the flow of the music. In Mendelssohn's ''Song Without Words'' in C (Op. 67No. 4) and in the final movement of Beethoven Sonata in G (Op. 14No. 2)the pianist paddled smoothly through the streams of fastswirling notes. He glided across the pristine surfaces of Ravel's eerie ''Oiseaux tristes'' and mastered the formidable intricacies and Spanish rhythms of the composer's ''Alborada del gracioso.''

Elsewherehoweverhis playing sounded almost frustratingly benignwith the ordinarily disputatious Chopin B-flat minor Sonata - a score full of conflicted emotions - passing under Mr. Simon's hands without raising much of a fuss at all.

Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lessonstudents consider the value of a photograph and the circumstances under which photographs are takenresearch the importance of a particular photographand create original photographs that illustrate the emotionsevents or ideas portrayed in photographs of international news.



Author(s):

Michelle SaleThe New York Times Learning Network

Javaid KhanThe Bank Street College of Education in New York City

Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Consider the value of a photograph and the opportunities for perfect pictures.

2. Examine the propaganda used to announce the United States’ reinstatement into UNESCO by reading and discussing “A Photo OP: O SayCan You See the Eiffel Tower?”

3. In pairsresearch the politicalsocial and historical facts of an international photograph and examine the meanings conveyed by that image.

4. Individuallycreate an original image representing the emotionsmeanings or issues discovered in the photograph they researched during class.

Resources / Materials:

-pens/pencils

-student journals

-classroom blackboard

-copies of “A Photo Op: O SayCan You See the Eiffel Tower?” (one per student)

-International sections of The New York Times or copies of photos printed from the online edition of the International section (//www.nytimes.com/world) or from On This Day in History ( //www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday)(enough for students to share)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journalsstudents respond to the following prompt (written on the board prior to class): “What is a ‘photo opportunity’? What does the phrase‘A picture is worth a thousand words’ mean?” After a few minutesallow students time to share their answers. As a classdiscuss the difference between a posed and a candid photo. At what events are photographs usually staged? What types of people are often in posed photos? Why?

2. As a classread and discuss “A Photo Op: O SayCan You See the Eiffel Tower?,” focusing on the following questions:

a. Why was Laura Bush in Paris?

b. What is the purpose of her five-day trip to Paris and Moscow?

c. For what does UNESCO stand?

d. What values did Mrs. Bush proclaim “will help defeat terror and lead to a better and safer world”?

e. Why did the Reagan administration decide to withdraw the United States from UNESCO in 1984?

f. How was the photo to include Mrs. Bushthe American flag and the Eiffel Tower staged?

g. What did French President Jacques Chirac do for his “photo opportunity”?

h. How much money must the United States pay to rejoin UNESCO?

3. Divide the class into pairs. Explain that each pair will be analyzing a photograph taken from the International section of the New York Times for its historicalpolitical and social value. Using this informationstudents will then create scrapbooks of headlines and articles that explain the context for their photographs. [If students are to look at images onlinedirect them to the online edition of the International section (//www.nytimes.com/world) or from On This Day in History ( //www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday).]

Allow students five minutes to locate a photograph they would like to use for this assignment. Prior to conducting research to learn factual information about the photographallow groups five minutes to examine the image carefully and brainstorm answers to the following “Pre-Test” (written on the board):

–Is this a candid or posed shot? How can you tell?

–Where was it taken?

–When was it taken?

–What “message” does it convey?

If time allowsinvite pairs to present their photographs and their initial assumptions about the image. (This part of the activity is optional.)

Nextask students to research the facts underlying their photograph by having them answer the following questions:

–Is this a candid or posed shot?

–Where was it taken?

–When was it taken?

–Why was it taken?

–What is the meaning behind the photo?

–How might this photo be used today to illustrate a particular eventemotioncause or struggle?

–Who might use this photo to promote a particular eventemotioncause or struggle?

Encourage all students to take notes on the research gathered in classas they will need it to complete their homework assignment. In a future classallow students to present their photos and the facts as part of a larger discussion about propaganda and the role of photography.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individuallystudents will create an original image that represents the same emotionsmeanings or issues conveyed by the photograph they studied in class. They may compose (even stage)and then takean actual photographor they may write “stage notes” and illustrate what they would include in a new photograph. Students should write a brief explanation of their new photograph that explains the emotionsmeaningsor issues they are trying to conveyas well as the different subjects or props included in the photo.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–Why is Mrs. Bush visiting Moscow next?

–Why does the United States want international support for its occupation of Iraq?

–Why are Mrs. Bush’s delegation members from Texas?

–What is the difference between propaganda and documentary? –What are some examples of propaganda that is helpful? What are some examples of propaganda that is injurious? How can you tell the difference?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on initial journal responsesparticipation in class and pair discussionsthoughtful completion of pre-test and researchand creation or description of an updated photo illustrating the ideas of the photograph they researched during class.

Vocabulary:

 465,  2016, a, The first Beethoven sonata I learned as a young pianist was the dramatic “Pathétique.” When I started working on itI tried to copy the way the great Rudolf Serkin played it on a recording I loved. There is a place for learning by emulating mastersbut it can easily become inhibiting. Fairly early onaspiring musicians must develop their own voices.

So when a score that meticulously transcribes every detail of Glenn Gould’s famed 1981 recording of Bach’s “Goldberg” Variations was published recentlywhile I was impressed with the painstaking effort involvedI questioned what it was for.

What’s its purpose? For whom is it intended? From what we know of Gouldhe would have been baffledeven horrifiedat the idea that a student learning the “Goldberg” Variations would precisely mimic his performance. He was too restless a thinker to consider any recording of his at all definitive. And imitating a pianist as idiosyncratic as Gould may not be a good idea for impressionable young musicians.

Gould’s 1981 versionissued just days before his death from a stroke at 50 in October 1982electrified the classical music world nearly as much as his classic 1955 recording had. That first version turned what had been considered a harpsichord piece for Bach specialists and erudite audiences into an unlikely hit that made the gangly22-year-old Canadian a sensation with the new generation. The fascination remainsjudging from a new hip-hop remix project of Gould recordings by a young music producer.

 4667,  1992, a, "I don't feel like it was a raw deal for me," Hector said. "With six weeksI should be ready to go."

Hector said that he's leaving open the possibility that the Jets will call him backbut he said there were no guarantees offered when he reached his injury settlement with team officials this morning.

"If they feel like after six weeks I'm 100 percent healthy and I can help the teamthen they'll call me back," Hector said.

Coslet said the thought of having Hector return about the middle of the season was in the back of the Jets officials' minds when they made the injury settlement. Coslet said the team's situation would dictate whether Hector would be brought back at the end of six weeks.

Hector said he hadn't thought about the possibility of being picked up by another team. That is unlikely since he has an injury that will require six weeks to heal. If he does not return to the Jetshe will be remembered for his performance against Miami in the final game of last season.

He was a leader in the study of insect and plant co-evolution. Dr. Fraenkel suggested that plants developed a class of ''secondary'' chemical compounds to repel or attract insects. In 1940with Donald GunnDr. Fraenkel wrote ''Orientation of Animals,'' the seminal work on animal behavior.

Dr. Fraenkel was born in MunichGermanyon April 231901He graduated from the University of Munich and recieved a doctorate in zoology in 1925. With the rise of the Nazishe moved to London in 1933. He came to the United States in 1948beginning his association with the University of Illinois.

Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union on Oct. 31and Mr. Johnson has vowed that it will happen on timewith or without a deal. But opposition parties and a significant number of rebels in his Conservative Party are adamantly opposed to a no-deal Brexitwhich they say would be chaotic and economically damaging in the short and long term.

Seeking to tie Parliament’s handsMr. Johnson said last week that he had asked the queen to prorogueor suspendParliament later this monthcutting short the already tight time frame for lawmakers to come up with a way to prevent Britain from crashing out of the European Union with no agreement in place.

The move left lawmakers scrambling for a way to weigh in on the most momentous decision the country has faced in its recent history. They decided to ram through legislation requiring the government to seek a Brexit extension if it has not reached an agreement with the European Union on withdrawal by the deadline.

Mr. Johnson has made it clear that he was unalterably opposed to seeking another extensionand on Tuesday he reiterated his plan to call for snap elections if the legislation were approved.

“I don’t want an electionthe public don’t want an electionbut if the House votes for this bill tomorrowthe public will have to choose who goes to Brussels on Oct. 17 to sort this out and take this country forward,” Mr. Johnson saidreferring to the next European Union summitwhich is seen as the final moment for a deal to be reached.

 1430,  2011, a, Fixes looks at solutions to social problems and why they work.

Carolyn Silveira

Big institutions are often slow to awaken to major social transformations. Microsoft was famously late to grasp the importance of the Internet. American auto manufacturers were slow to identify the demand for fuel-efficient cars. And todaythe United States government is making a similar mistake: it still doesn’t seem to recognize that Americans no longer work the way they used to.

Todaysome 42 million people — about a third of the United States work force — do not have jobs in the traditional sense. They fall into a catchall category the government calls “contingent” workers. These people — independent contractorsfreelancerstemp workerspart-timerspeople between jobs — typically work on a project-to-project basis for a variety of clientsand most are outcasts from the traditional system of benefits that provide economic security to Americans. Even as the economy has changedemployment benefits are still based on an outdated industrial-era model in which workers are expected to stay with a single company for yearsif not their whole careers.

The industrial-era model of employer-based health care no longer applies.

For most of the 20th centuryit was efficient to link benefits to jobs this way. But todaymore and more work falls outside the one-to-oneemployee-to-employer relationship. Work is decentralizedworkers are mobileand working arrangements are fluid. Howeverthe risks of life haven’t gone away: people still need protections. They just need a different system to distribute them. They need benefits that they can carry aroundlike their laptops. As things standmillions of independent workers go without health and unemployment insuranceprotection against discrimination and unpaid wagesand pension plans. It makes no sense.

One of the social innovators to recognize this problem early and act on it was Sara Horowitzthe founder of the Freelancers Unionwhich has more than 165,000 members across all 50 states. At Fixeswe highlight practical applications of ideas that have the potential to achieve widespread impact. That means looking at how ideas take root in institutions that become part of the fabric of society.

In the early 20th centurya landscape of new institutions — including the early labor unions and hundreds of civil society organizations like Rotary Internationalthe Boy and Girl Scoutsand the N.A.A.C.P. — reshaped the American landscape. Todaythe Freelancers Union offers a glimpse of the kind of social enterprise — mission-driven and pragmaticmarket-savvy and cooperative — that is likely to proliferate in the coming years to meet the needs of a fast-changing work force and society.

Horowitz had been a labor lawyer and union organizer whenin the early 1990sshe recognized that the number of people turning to independent work was on the rise. It was also clear that institutions had not yet been built to represent them in any meaningful way. (On one occasionHorowitz found herself misclassified by an employer as an independent contractor — and quickly discovered that she received no job benefits.) Horowitz had the idea to create an organization to bring freelancers together so they could wield their power in the marketplace and in the political arenamuch like AARP does for retirees.

She quickly discovered that their biggest concern was the cost of health insurance. But there were other problemstoo. Unlike traditional workers who receive unemployment benefitsindependent contractors have to rely on their own resources to get through hard times. In 2009Freelancers Union surveyed 3,000 members and found that more than 80 percent had gone jobless or underemployed during the year. More than 60 percent had used their credit cards or borrowed from friends and family to make ends meetand 12 percent had to turn to food stamps. Close to 40 percent had given upor downgradedtheir health insurance protection.

Another problem was getting paid. Some companieslike Time Inc.actually charge freelancers penalties if they request payment within 25 days. Freelancers Union found that 77 percent of its members had been cheated by a client during their careers and 40 percent had had trouble getting paid in 2009. The average wage loss was $6,000. The Department of Labor protects traditional workers from unpaid wagesbut freelancers have no equivalent recourse. Then there were difficulties obtaining mortgagesthe lack of access to 401(k) plansand other issues.

An insurance provider that stays viable by not seeking to maximize profits.

Horowitz saw that she could attract a large membership if she could figure out how to provide health insurance at lower cost. Health insurance companies don’t have much love for freelancers. They prefer to serve large groups because it’s easier to deal with one corporate benefits manager than a multitude of individuals. And because insurers often lack reliable information about independent workersthey tend to assume that they are risky. As a resultpremiums in the open marketplace for health insurance are higher and more volatile than those for employees. (The Affordable Care Act is designed to address this problem beginning in 2014 by subsidizing private insurancebut it applies only to people with low and moderate incomes.)

Horowitz got the idea of grouping freelancers in New York State so they could purchase their health insurance together. It made sense in theorybut it had never been done. She worked closely with officials in Albanynotably Assemblyman Sheldon Silverwho was a strong allyand Gregory Seriothe former superintendent of insurance for New York Statewho had the authority to grant approval for “discretionary” insurance groups.

“A lot of health insurers have looked at individual and sole proprietors as very expensive and risky to underwrite,” explained Serio. “Sara was able to foresee a trend [in the rise of independent work] before a lot of other people did. She went and found out that these people were not bad risks. Her creativity was in using existing concepts of insurance risk sharing and applying it to a community that has been ignored by the marketplace andin factalmost vilified by the marketplace.”

Serio and Horowitz made an interesting team. “I was a conservative Republican from Nassau County working for George Pataki,” he told me. “And she was my liberal friend from Brooklyn.” But Serio found the idea of protecting freelancers appealing because his father had been a dentist who operated out of a second-floor walk-up office on Jamaica Avenuein WoodhavenQueens. “I grew up in a sole proprietor household,” he said. “If my father didn’t workhe didn’t get paid. And I knew what it was like seeing health insurance rates go up and up.”

Todaythe Freelancers Insurance Company (F.I.C.)which is wholly owned by the Freelancers Union (a nonprofit)has revenues of roughly $100 million and covers 25,000 independent workers and their family members in New York Stateoffering them premiums that the company calculates are more than a third below the open market rate. Close to 60 percent of its clients were previously uninsured or on COBRA (a temporary extension of their previous insurance). The renewal rate last year was 97 percent. (Disclosure: I have purchased health insurance from F.I.C. for a number of years.) The company was financed with $17 million in loans and grants from social investorsincluding the Rockefeller Foundationthe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the New York City Investment Fund. “Our freelancers have access to the best doctors and hospitals,” says Horowitz. “We have skilled human resource peoplejust like Fortune 500 companies. We’re able to watch out for our members.”

How can the F.I.C. undercut market rates and still be a viable enterprise? The key is that while it seeks to be profitableit does not seek to maximize profits. Its executives receive salaries that are below industry averagesand it has only one shareholder (the Freelancers Union) to satisfy. Those are fundamental differences. Silverwho is the speaker of the State Assemblynotes that the success of the F.I.C. makes it more difficult for traditional insurers to contend that they can’t deliver insurance at lower cost. “Duplicating the model and showing the ability of [the F.I.C.] to keep costs under control is something that we will be looking at,” he adds.

Like many social goodshealth insurance is often seen through a binary lens: either it must be handled by the government or it must be handled by the free market. But the F.I.C. is demonstrating that a middle way can worktooand that it may be preferable to provide vital services like insurance through social-benefit companiesat least to certain customer groups. In factthe Affordable Care Act has a provision to finance a new type of nonprofit health insurance company that would be run by its customers. It would be called a Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP). The Freelancers Union has proposed to establish CO-OPs in FloridaNew JerseyNew YorkOregon and Washington.

Because the F.I.C. has a close connection with freelancersit can be more effective helping its members make good health care decisions. “We’re moving away from fee-for-service medicine to one where a primary care doctor aggressively coordinates care,” explains Horowitz. “We’re also trying to innovate with alternative care — promoting meditationyogaand nutrition which can have long-term beneficial effects.” In 2012the organization will be opening up the Brooklyn Freelancers Medical Practicea health center modeled on the medical-home approach and designed in partnership with a physician named Rushika Fernandopullewho pioneered a team-based model of care that is attracting attention across the country.

For nowthe United States government doesn’t keep an accurate count of the independent work force. This is an oversight. It appears likely that this way of working will continue to grow. In cities with concentrations of knowledge workersyou find a proliferation of co-working spaces designed specifically for freelancers. And online marketplaces for freelancers like EtsyoDesk and Elance are expanding rapidly.

It’s not just hipsters who work like this. Forty-five percent of Freelancers Union members are over 40 years old. Not all follow this path by choice. Many freelancers are former employeeslike journalistswho lost jobs. Recent college graduatesdiscovering that a degree is far from a job guaranteeare forced to be more entrepreneurial. And many companiesseeking to hold costs downengage freelancers rather than hire full-time workers. All of these workers deserve the same protections accorded to others.

“The industrial workers of the 20th century helped bring about the New Deal,” says Horowitz. “But the New Deal hasn’t evolved to include independent workers. I think this work force will help bring about the next New Deal — a framework of economic security that is parallel in its goals but led by a network of new institutions.”

“The government can’t replace civil society,” she added. “So if the civil society organizations have controlit will be harder to have your benefits taken away — if you happen to lose an election.”

On WednesdayI’ll report on some of the other ways the Freelancers Union is helping to make independent work more secure. In the meantimeif you are a freelanceror know someone who works this waylet us know about your experiences.

Same securitywith a closed off paddock accessible only to the few with passes attributedand with drivers so busy and deep in concentration that talking to them was almost impossible. Many of the faces were also the same as in Formula One.

“Karting is Formula One in miniature,” said Franck Lagorcewho was there as the leader of the team of French drivers.

And indeed it was. In factwho should I run into but Nicolas Todtthe son of the Ferrari director Jean Todt. Nicolas is also the manager of Felipe Massaand a director of the title-winning GP2 team. Nicolas was attending the kart race to watch over another of his driversJules Bianchiwho was racing in Formula Athe highest level of karting. Patrick Tambaythe former Formula One driverwas there with his son Adrien. Former Formula One driver Jan Lammers’ son Bas was there racing as well. And I recognized one or two people from Bridgestone who are usually in the Formula One paddockbut priorities brought them to the karting track to take care of the tires.

(I didn’t recognize any of the engine people thoughbut decided I’d stick my minidisc recorder’s microphone out along the main straight and record some engine sounds as the karts passed. So you can click here and listen to the engines and practically see the karts pass before your eyes as the spectators did on the same straight pictured in the photo abovesince the recording is in stereo.)

FinallyI should mention that in a way this miniature Formula One weekend turned into a “real” and not a “virtual” paddock for one of the readers of this blogPierre-Etienne Bostwho maintains the excellent blog de course. Pierre-Etienne and I met on Sunday for the first timeand spent the afternoon in the paddock.

And to round out the theme of the karting being all about the future of Formula Onesome things work by way of the past as well. Pierre-Etienne pointed out to me that Adrien Tambay’s kart bore the same sponsor that his father’s cars did in Formula One: Moulin Rouge.

Like the Formula One racethe final of the karting world championships was raced on Sunday on a wet track. Just minutes before the start it began to rain very heavily and the race was delayed by five minutes as many drivers had to put rain tires onincluding Bianchiwho was starting from second on the grid. It then stopped raining but with a soaked trackBianchi got off to a great start and led the race gaining a massive lead lap after lapjust as Fernando Alonso did in Formula One in the morning. But Bianchi17like Alonsothen found himself in trouble and on the fifth lap he was passed by Davide Forethe 32-year-old Italian former world champion. He then abandoned the race on lap 7 with a technical problem.

Fore led until with seven laps leftanother ItalianFrancesco Antonucci passed Fore and won the race and the world karting title. It was his first world titleand he started the race on the fifth row.

As soon as Formula One has a boring raceit is criticized for being a boring formula. Often the critics say that the drivers should all have the same material and it would not be so boring. But today in this world championship kart racethe highest level of the lowest form of motor racingthere was no comparison at all: today’s Formula One race was much more exciting.

This is not to denigrate a three-day weekend of fun and exciting qualifying races leading up to the final race. Its 15,000 spectators had an excellent final race and a great weekend of karting entertainment – especially those who had the privilege of being able to go into exclusive Formula One-like the paddock. In factit wasn’t all new to Pierre-Etiennewho used to race karts at a regional level in Franceand who said the paddock did not used to be so exclusive even a few years ago.

(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.)

It has been two months since officials at the University of Southern California announced that the university’s presidentC.L. Max Nikiaswould resign. The announcement came after a sustained outcry from facultystudents and alumni over the way the administration dealt with Dr. George Tyndalla longtime gynecologist accused of inappropriate behavior for decades. The faculty offered a vote of no confidenceand hundreds of top professors publicly called for his resignation.

But while the board of trustees announcedon May 25 that Mr. Nikias “agreed to begin an orderly transition” to a new administrationlittle has changed on campus this summer. Nowmore than 650 professors have signed a letter demanding that he leave before students arrive this month.

“With no follow-up regarding an interim president or a presidential search processwe find ourselves in a state of turmoil and uncertainty,” the letter addressed to the board of trustees said. “President Nikias cannot be the one who stands up to greet the new students at the convocation. If he iswe face the prospect of student protests and walkoutsparent outrageand a broad public perception that we have gone back on our commitment to accountability and transparencyas the world outside U.S.C. believes he has already resigned.”

Brenda Maceothe university’s vice president for public relations and marketingsaid in an email that Mr. Nikias is on vacationas is his top deputyProvost Michael Quick. In their absenceJim Statenthe chief financial officer of the universityis acting president until Mr. Quick returnsshe said.
 5225,  1988, a, In a country where the Flemish- and French-speaking populations have battled for decadesMr. Leysen's role demonstrates the rapidly expanding economic power of the Flemish. Besides its industrial holdingsGenerale is said to have interests in more than 1,200 companiesincluding major Belgian banksarmament makersinsurance companies and chemical and metals concerns. A Change in Criticism

While many of Belgium's newspapers have decried the idea of an Italian taking control of Belgium's largest holding companylast week many of Belgium's French-language papers attacked the idea that someone from Flanders might take control.

''A lot of Belgium's French-speaking people would much rather have de Benedetti take control than Leysen,'' one prominent Flemish journalist said.

Mr. Leysenconsidered one of Belgium's most aggressive financierssaid last week that the investor group would buy 12 million new shares in Generale - all of the company's planned capitalization issue. If the issuewhich would increase the company's capitalization by almost 60 percentsurvives a court challengeMr. Leysen's group will pay almost $900 million to obtain about 34 percent of the company.

''Now it seems clear that Generale de Belgique will be changed fundamentally - whether or not de Benedetti ever gets a controlling interest,'' said Patrick Vermeulenan analyst with DewaaySebille Servais et Compagnie in Brussels. 'Why Not Collaborate?'

On FridayMr. Leysen suggested that he and Mr. de Benedetti talk. Some analysts said the men might join forces to improve Generale's undervalued stock price and underperforming operations. Perhaps the best known of these is the struggling Fabrique Nationale d'Armes d'Herstal S.A.known for the Browning gun.

''Let's accept the reality that there are two blocks of shareholders,'' Mr. Leysen said. ''Why not collaborate to defend the interests of all shareholdersmanagers and staff?'' He addedhoweverthat he felt there was a ''need to anchor Societe Generale's share holdings firmly in Belgian hands.''
 4489,  1993, a, Lookanything with elastomeric fins and grips has to be worth a few extra cents.

Those features are the key elements on the Gillette Company's latest shaver -- make that "shaving system" -- for men that was announced yesterdaythe Sensor Excel.

The new product is available in Europe and Canada and will be sold elsewhere in the worldincluding the United Statesas soon as officials of the company measure its success.

For Gillettethe Sensor Excel represents the latest shaving technologyfollowing the wildly successful Sensor Systemwhich began shearing men in 1990. The new product was tested by more than 5,800 menwhose responses that its soft fins near the blades contributed to smoother shaves convinced Gillette that it could charge about $4 for the productabout 15 percent higher than the Sensor.

"On the basis of testingSensor Excel has demonstrated to be an absolutely superior product," said Robert J. Murraythe executive vice president of Gillette's North American Group.
 5879,  1983, a, PERHAPS aspiring to the mantle once worn by such entertainers as Bob Hope and Martha RayeSuzanne Somers appears to be turning into a trouper in search of a war. Since leaving ABC's ''Three's Company,'' following a rather nasty and very public salary disputeMiss Somers has been doing a nightclub act and an occasional variety special for CBS. Her last television appearance was taped aboard the aircraft carrier Ranger at the San Diego Naval Station. Tonight at 10she can be seen entertaining Army and Air Force personnel at Ramstein Air Base in KaiserslauternWest Germany. The hour is calledwith an almost leering exclamation point''Suzanne Somers ... and 10,000 G.I.s!''

As an ambassador to the armed forcesMiss Somers falls somewhere between the typical beauty-contest winner paraded out for such occasions and ''Verna: the U.S.O. Girl,'' the vulnerablequestionably talented young woman created by the writer Paul Gallico and depicted on television not too long ago by Sissy Spacek. With a perky personality and shaggy blond hairshe is unflaggingly awed and sincere. Bouncing onto the stage in red sequined tightsshe tells her understandably cheering audience: ''What a welcome! I can't believe it! Fifty thousand soldiers all to myself!'' The exclamation point is clearly an integral part of the Somers act.

The supporting cast includes Jonathan Winterswhose appearances are kept noticeably shortespecially when he shows the slightest inclination to become too irreverent about the event. The Pointer Sisters are brought on to do their foot-tappinghand-clapping actbut not before Miss Somers has co-opted their popular ''Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy'' number for herself. And Susan Antonanother blond actress-singer who has had a checkered television careerdoes a solo and some cute production numbers with Miss Somers. Miss Anton is very tall.

Miss Somers does trygoing from slightly blue material (''I thought bivouac was something you did with a paddle'') to the blatantly manipulative (bringing a serviceman up from the audience while she sings ''You Made Me Love You''). Throughoutan effort is made to portray the G.I.'s as lonely guys doing their duty on the front lines. Sometimesa serviceman appears on the screen to send greetings back home (''Hello to mom and dadand Rosa and Jose Vasquez'').
 3127,  2001, a, 'Sex' and the Lie

The big lie in television shows about New York used to be that we all lived in large apartments with skyline views. The current big liethanks to ''Sex and the City,'' is that single women in New York date an endless stream of troublesome and inappropriate men. (Actuallymonths go by before one has the opportunity to meet one.)

The serieshoweveris a huge hitas was evidenced by the extravagant party HBO threw to kick off the new season Wednesday night. Under a tent in Damrosch Park were canopied bedspink lighting (as single girls knoweverybody looks good under pink lighting) and a display of MANOLO BLAHNIK shoessafely encased under glass.

 323,  2017, a, WASHINGTON — Facing mounting pressure over civilian casualties in American airstrikesthe United States-led coalition fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria said on Saturday that it was likely that at least 229 civilians had been unintentionally killed by its operations since they began in August 2014.

In Februarythe last month covered by the report and the first full month of the Trump administrationfour such civilians were killedthe coalition said. The assessmentissued monthlytherefore does not include the March 17 strike against a building in Mosul in which scores if not hundreds of civilians were killedaccording to Iraqi witnesses. That strike is under investigation.

The coalition’s overall count is far less than estimates by some human rights groups. Airwarsa nongovernment organization that monitors reports of civilian casualties in international airstrikeshas asserted that at least 2,831 civilians are likely to have been killed as of March 28 by the coalition’s air attacks since August 2014.

The worries about civilian casualties have grown as Iraqi forces push to take western Mosul from the Islamic State with the help of American and allied air powerrockets and artillery. President Trump has vowed to step up the fight against the militantsthough the basic strategy in Mosul was set by American commanders during the Obama administration.
 4984,  1990, a, Judge Souter's personal - not his professional - resume raises troublesome questions. We do not see in his past a body of experience with people other than white middle-class males. He resides in a tiny New Hampshire town (population about 2,000)lives in the same small farmhouse in which he was bornhas never married and apparently has almost no social life. The Senate may well be looking at a nominee whose major experience with blacks comes from watching the ''Cosby Show'' and whose deepest understanding of the concerns of women comes from books and perhaps films.

Our society has expended effort to create social institutions in which people of all kinds and both sexes can mingle. We have done this because we have more than an intuitive sense of the value of social integration and the peril of social isolation.

Social inclusion can produce a truly intelligent American: one who can relate to our national life in all its facetswho knows the wellspring -the aspirations and fearsthe affections and indifferences - from which particular kinds of thought and behavior flow. Social and geographical seclusionhowevermay very well yield an intellectual who may be smart on technical matters but lacking ''intelligence of the heart'' when it comes to human affairs.

From all accountsour society will become even more diverse as we enter the next century. Whites will be outnumbered by blacksHispanicsAsians and other people of color. As our least democratic governmental institutionthe Supreme Court can least afford to be managed by those from elites who have little feel for their social environment.

If the news reports about Judge Souter are correctit is fair to say that no other male nominee to the Supreme Court in recent memory has so distanced himself from minoritieswomenthe disabledthe downtrodden and the powerless as Judge Souter has.

Justice Marshall was as correct in apparently questioning the judge's ability to relate to life as the President was remiss in focusing only on the judge's ability to handle technical legal questions. The Senate Judiciary Committee must now assure the American people that Judge Souter is qualified on both counts.
 5779,  1985, a, HEAT AND HUMIDITY grip Miami every day of a long summer that stretches past September to the last weeks of October. In July and Augustthe discomfort index is as high as the new downtown skyline. The heat is even more oppressive in the northern reaches of the cityin a decaying suburb-turned-ghetto called Opa-Lockaa forgotten 1920's oasis of ersatz Moorish architecture and littered streets with whimsical names like Ali Baba Boulevard. In this settingthe Miami Dolphinsthe 1984 American Football Conference championsprepare for another season on the athletic fields of St. Thomas Universitya Roman Catholic campus of lowconcrete-block buildings and scrub pine.

Heat shimmers and billows from the ground as squads of playerseach wearing about 25 pounds of equipmentpush themselves through two punishing90-minute drills a day. During morning practicethe field is airless and bathed in full sunshinea combination that makes even the casual stroller break out in a sweat. Players who Jon Nordheimer is The Times's bureau chief in Miami. are free agents hoping to make the team and those from the draft who want to break into the starting lineup quickly discover in the six-week training camp whether their bodies and minds are tough enough to withstand the punishment dished out by the broiling south Florida climate . . . and by Don Shulahead coach of the Dolphins.

''I like to think that I'm intense and driven,'' Shula sayswith a crooked smile in the direction of those who suggest that the point of all those stories - many of them unflattering - is essentially true: that he is the National Football League's toughest taskmaster since Vince Lombardi of Wisconsin's Green Bay Packers. But unlike LombardiShula has demonstrated an impressive flexibility in offensive strategy. He was capable of employing a grind'em-out running offense for his 1970's teamsand in the last two years he has developed one of the most successful passing games in the history of the N.F.L. (For Shula's comments on three of his finest quarterbackssee boxpage 19.) At the age of 55Shulahead coach of the Dolphins since 1970 and for seven previous seasons with the Baltimore Coltshas the best career winning average (.716) among active coaches with 10 or more years in the N.F.L. (Lombardi's average was .740.) He is arguably the most widely admired coach in professional football in addition to being one of the best paid in all professional sportswith a three-year contract that reportedly pays him at least $800,000 a year -more than his star players (although the quarterback Dan Marino is demanding a contract from club owner Joe Robbie that would pay over $1 million yearly). ShulaTom Landry of the Dallas Cowboys and Chuck Noll of the Pittsburgh Steelers have between them sent 15 teams to the Super Bowl since 1969a figure representing almost half of the total number of teams represented in play at Super Bowls over that period.

Renowned for his insistence on rigorous physical and mental preparationas well as his bursts of abusive language and iron-glove disciplineShula is no longer the explosivehot-tempered coach who cowed playersrefereesassistants and members of the press with the manic intensity of one who placed winning above everything. But the newmellow Shula is no less demanding than in the old daysand anyone who confuses the crooked smile with an easing of discipline learns in summer camp that it is as much a mirage as the wavy bands of heat rising from the sun-blasted playing field.

 3213,  2001, a, Bowing to reality but still confident about growthexecutives of Home Depot Inc. reduced the company's expected earnings growth yesterday to an increase of 18 to 20 percent a year for the next three years. Last yearthey had predicted a growth rate of 23 percent to 25 percent for the company.

The announcement came at the company's annual meeting for Wall Street analysts and investors in Atlantawhere Home Depotthe country's biggest home-improvement chainis based. Investors appeared to like the newsdriving shares of Home Depot up $2.63to $46.65in the heaviest trading since September.

''It was a relief rally,'' said Colin McGranahana retail analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. ''The numbers were what I expectedand pretty much what the market expected.''

It was the first meeting led by the chairman and chief executiveRobert L. Nardelliwho replaced Home Depot's founders less than a year ago after a long career at General Electric. Like many executives in retailMr. Nardelli watched the ground shift beneath him as the sputtering economy and the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 made shoppers newly cost-conscious and reluctant to make any but the most essential purchases. That shift has required the company to embrace a plan of action that makes cost cutting as important as rapid expansion.

 260,  2018, a, With the country’s book fair — the third largest in the Arab worldafter Cairo and Beirut — scheduled in Novemberofficials have pushed back. “There is no book banning in Kuwait,” read a recent statement by the Ministry of Information. “There is a book censorship committee that reviews all books.”

An assistant minister of informationMuhammad Abdul Mohsen al-Awashelaborated. “In Kuwaitover the past five years only 4,300 books were banned out of 208,000 books — that means only 2 percent are banned and 98 percent are approved,” he said. “Some books are being banned in the U.S.EuropeBeirut and other countriestoo.”

In the past 11 monthshe said3,600 books were approved by censorswhile 700 were banned.

Yethe insisted“since its inceptionKuwait has always been known for its sponsorship of literature and culture.”

It is a particularly sensitive issue because Kuwait’s emirSheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabahhas pushed to make his country a regional cultural hub. While theaterdance and music are under royal patronage and exempt from censorshipbooks are not.

“That cultural hub just cannot happen when you have a book massacre like thisall these books being banned,” said Bothyana Al-Essaa Kuwaiti author whose book “Maps of Wandering” was banned. Kuwaiti censors banned the book over a child abuse scene set in MeccaSaudi Arabiashe saidbut the Saudis never banned the book in their countrywhere it was a best seller.

Bans have for the first time extended to many international books and reference books already on Kuwaiti shelvesat least in part because of parliamentary pressurecritics say.

Originallythe players said it was their key issueand they demanded major reforms. Nowthey seem ready to give up most of their requests for change and have agreed to modest alterations in the current formulanot all of them in their favor.

Group I playerswho are under the age of 24 or have played fewer than five years professionallywould still be able to solicit offers from other teams. But the former team would have the right to match any offera new provision that favors the owners. If the teams don't agree on a transfer of players to replace the departed playerthey submit proposals to an arbitratorwho decidesas has been the case in previous years.

Group II playersages 24 to 30could have more mobility than before because the compensation formula would be less harsh. Nowif a player wishes to change teams for a salary of $400,000 or morehis new team can be penalized by as many as five first-round draft choices. Under the new formulacompensation would be on a graduated scalewith no more than one first-round choice awarded for up to a $500,000 salary. More draft choices would be awarded as salaries go higher.

The age of Group III players will be lowered from 31 to 30not the age 29 the players wanted. The original team can still match the offeras is the case now. A slight improvement for the players. There is no player compensation involved with Group III players.

A. M. Rosenthal (columnJuly 29) suggests that it would be imprudent to send William F. Weld as ambassador to Mexico because Mr. Weld is ''soft'' on drugs.

An ambassador is supposed to act on behalf of a particular governmentas a President is supposed to act on behalf of the people.

An ambassador's individual opinions on a particular issue should not affect administration policy. As William J. Bennett says in his adjoining Op-Ed articleon alcohol marketing and inner-city crime''conservatives need to go where the factsnot ideologylead.''

 942,  2013, a, There are now more agents along the 1,954 mile-long border than ever before… Border agents per sector. Staffing has more than doubled in most of the nine sectors along the borderbut the growth has not been uniform. Nearly 40 percent of the border staff in 2012 was in Tucson or El Pasotwo sectors covering about 500 miles of the border with declining shares of immigrant traffic. They were among the main locations of illegal border crossings during the Mexican migration wave that peaked around 2005.

…and apprehensions along the border have dropped sharply … Apprehensions per sector. Overallapprehensions have fallen as the number of people caught trying to cross the border illegally has declined sharply in recent yearslargely because there were fewer people trying to cross the border in the first place. The recession was a factor. But criminal control on the Mexican side of the border and increased border patrol staffing increased the risks and cost of the tripmaking it harder to cross successfully in recent years.
 1334,  2011, a, PHILADELPHIA — Just before ducking into the indoor batting cage Sunday afternoonJose Reyes spotted an old mentor he had not seen in five yearsone who had a big impact on his careerhe said.

The man was Bobby Valentinethe former Mets manager who was at Citizens Bank Park in his role as a broadcaster for ESPN. He was in the clubhouse to talk to Terry Collinsthe current Mets managerbefore the gamewhen Reyes saw him. Valentine went over and greeted Reyeskissing the back of his handand came away with a huge smilesaying“And by the wayin case anyone asksI made him into a switch-hitter.”

Although Reyes was already technically a switch-hitter when Valentine got to him during spring training in 2002there is some truth to what Valentine said becauseaccording to ReyesValentine made him into a real switch-hitter.

“At that time it was still kind of new to me and I was struggling from the left side,” Reyes said. “I didn’t have any confidencebut Bobby helped me a lot. He really worked with me and it made a huge difference for me.”

It was on a trip to Fort Lauderdale in the spring of 2002while the Mets were there to play the Baltimore Orioles. Valentine had Reyeswho had played only in the Class A South Atlantic Leaguecome along on the two-hour trip. Reyes was 18 and had played in only 157 professional gamesbut his raw talent was obvious.

Valentine brought Reyeswho spoke little Englishand the bilingual coach Juan Lopez into the batting cage in the Orioles’ complex and worked with him for more than an hourfocusing purely on Reyes’s left-handed swing. Valentine watcheddemonstratedexplained and educated the young prospect.

“I took about 1,000 swings from the left side,” Reyes said. “He would watch me for a while and then say something and I would do what he just said. Then he would watch me take a few more swings and he would tell me something else. It went on like that for over an hour. I was sweating and getting tiredand listening to everything he said. It was great. I never forgot that day.”

Reyes grew up in Villa GonzalezSantiagoin the Dominican Republic and was strictly a right-handed hitter. Despite being very skinnyhe would hit a home run in almost every youth league game he played in.

But about a year before the Mets signed him in 1999Reyes began to consider the idea of becoming a switch-hitter. Learning to hit left-handed was a struggle at first. When he joined the organization professionallyit became even more difficult because the pitching he was facing was much better.

“It was hardman,” Reyes said. “You just don’t feel comfortableyou know? You get in there and you don’t feel confident and then these pitchers are throwing pretty good stuff and you can’t get a hit. It’s toughreally tough.”

He said that after that day with Valentinehe took a new confidence into the left-handed batter’s box with him.

“I really appreciated what he did for me,” Reyes said. “I was very young and up to that point I didn’t have anyone like that who could spend more than an hour working with me. That was a key for meit really was. It was very important for me to become a real switch-hitter.”

Reyes is still a stronger hitter from the right sidebring a .301 career batting average from that side of the plate into Sunday night’s game against the Philliescompared with a .282 average from the left side. This yearas has occasionally been the case in previous yearsis just the opposite. He went into Sunday’s game batting .326 from the left side and .240 from the right. Reyes is hitting .308 over all.

In spring 2002at the end of his session with Valentinewho would manage the Mets only one more seasonValentine told Reyes he should be ready because if it were up to himReyes would be in the majors soon.

Unfortunately for Reyes and Valentineit would not happenand that is the postscript to the story. Reyes split his time that season between Class A St. Lucie and Class AA Binghamtonhitting a combined .288 with 8 home runs19 triples and 58 stolen bases.

Valentine’s Mets were so bad in 2002 that by the end of the season the principal owner Fred Wilpon told Valentine to manage the final week of the season as if it were the World Seriesa test to see whether the players were still listening to him. Valentine said“If that’s the casethen I want to bring up Jose Reyes.”

The requestwhich would have to have been executed by then general manager Steve Phillipswas denied. With Rey Ordonez and Marco Scutaro playing shortstopthe Mets went 1-6 in their final seven games and Valentine was fired. Reyes was finally promoted on June 10 the next yeartoo late for Valentine.

 4235,  1995, a, Gov. William F. Weld is set to announce plans on Wednesday to consolidate the state's education agencies into one powerful board as part of an effort to shrink state government. And he wants a former political rivalJohn R. Silberthe president of Boston Universityto run it.

"You need a lot of energy and aggressiveness to counteract the torpor of education," Mr. Weld said today in an interview at the Statehouse.

Under the Republican Governor's planwhich needs legislative approval before it can be put into effectthe education agencies would become a state Board of Education and Training. A plan to create such an agency in 1991 was defeated.

The current boardheaded by a part-time volunteer chairmanMartin Kaplanpresides over policies on primary and secondary education in the state. If the latest plan is approvedthe new board will eventually also make decisions about state collegesadult educationand job placement and training programsGovernor Weld said. The chairman's position would probably remain part time and unpaidofficials said.
 4028,  1996, a, Publishers are well aware that even a best seller can turn into a financial dud with an overpaid author and a big print run. Over the last five yearsprint runs for best-seller candidates have been inflated from an average minimum of 50,000 copies to at least 100,000and the shelf life of some other books has been compressed from four months to as little as four weeks.

''At timesit's like a big pyramid scheme where we keep shipping out the books and trying to hide the fact that there's a lot of dead titles,'' said Irwyn Applebaumthe president of Bantam Doubleday Dellwhich is owned by Bertelsmann A.G. ''Everybody is on such overdrive to make do and grow and expand that they don't stop and study this. I think that an adjustment is going to have to come. But it's a lot like nuclear disarmament. Just because you reduce your books doesn't mean that the other publishers are going to reduce their copies.''

Returns are the most significant barometer of the financial success of a booka measurement more critical than a ranking on a best-seller list because rejects cut directly into profits. Historicallypublishers have agreed to take back returns and absorb the loss to entice bookstores to stock their titles.

Many of the major publishing houses report that their companies have managed to escape the phenomenon relatively unscathedwith returns -- as a percentage of gross sales -- that are either flatdeclining or slightly above average.

Howeverfigures from their own trade groupthe American Association of Publishersindicate that in the last five years the losses from returns have expanded far faster than gross saleswhich are essentially the books that are shipped to bookstores. From 1990 to 1995the industry's losses for rejected hardback books increased by 60 percentto $531 millionwhile gross sales increased by 47 percentto $1.64 billion.

Although the figures show that more money is coming inthe system leaves publishers at increased risk. More books are being shipped outaccording to publishersand more books are being returned. They are coming back in such consistentrapid cycles that it has given rise to a debate about the efficiency of the industry.

At Random HouseMr. Vitale would say only that ''returns are higher than we would like them,'' although the gossipy industry is rife with talk about books coming back to the publisher by the truckload.

 5473,  1987, a, Those two countries were South Africa and the United States of America. As a junior tennis player in the middle and late 1950'sAshe was not allowed to play in major tournaments in Kentucky and in the state where he was born and livedVirginia.

He would eventually be allowed to play throughout both those nations.

This is recalled now because as the United States Open begins in Flushing Meadows todaydemonstrations are being organized against apartheid in South Africaand a resolution is to be submitted to the City Council that would ban South Africans from participating in events on public property. The United States Tennis Center is on a site owned by the City of New York. The organizers of the demonstration would seek to have all South Africans barred from participating in sports in the United Statesjust as individual tennis players aren't allowed to participate in Grand Prix events in Sweden and the Netherlands and New Zealand and Japan and Eastern European countries and many African countries.

South Africa as a nation is also barred from sending teams to the Olympics and the Davis Cup and the Federation Cup and world soccer and cricket and rugby events.

The position of the United States Tennis Associationwhich organizes the Openis that these 15 or so South Africans invited to play in the Open are individuals and with no known political associations with their government.

A similar position is taken by the State Department.

''Visa requests are taken on a case-by-case basis,'' said Anita Stockmana spokeswoman for the State Department. ''We look for specific things if we're going to keep somebody out. It's called a watch list. Are they known murderers? Have they acted contrary to U.S. laws? But there's no blanket ruling.''

 5387,  1987, a, Mr. Frampton said he hoped that the appointment of F. Dale Robertsonwho has been associate chief foresterto succeed Mr. Peterson as chief would create an opportunity for ''a new vision for our National Forests.''

''This vision should reflect the desires of the American people for unspoiled wildernessclean waterwildlife and recreation,'' Mr. Frampton said. But he said he was not optimistic. 'Logging Less in the '80's'

Mr. Peterson rejects the contention that there has been too much logging on his watch. ''Because of the budget crunch our programs may be somewhat out of balance,'' he said. ''Some of our recreational facilities are seriously in need of rehabilitation and some streams have become clogged up. But contrary to opinionwe are logging less in the 80's than we were in the 70's.''

Contentions of excessive roadbuilding are also unfoundedMr. Peterson says. He said that the number of miles of roads built in National Forests had gone down every year since he became chief and that many miles of logging road had been closed. As a resulthe saidthe forests now have 25 percent fewer miles of open road than when he became chief.

Mr. Peterson also says it is simply untrue that the Forest Service is rapidly punching roads into forests so as to make them unsuitable for future wilderness designation. ''That is not on our agenda,'' he said.

Ralph Max Peterson''Max'' to friend and foe alikeis 59 years old. He was born in BennettMo.and was trained not as a forester but as a civil engineer. He later received a master's degree in water-resource and land-use planning from Harvard. 'Almost an Institution'

George S. DunlopAssistant Secretary of Agriculture for natural resources and environmentsaid Mr. Peterson was ''almost an institution - he is a great leader who has the tremendous respect of everyone here.'' In part because of Mr. Peterson's leadership and the people he recruitedMr. Dunlop said''the Forest Service is recognized as one of the premier if not the premier Federal agencies in esprit de corps and professionalism.''

 3568,  1999, a, After they lost by a touchdown last Sunday to the Colts -- when a potential tying pass went off Wayne Chrebet's hands in the end zone -- linebacker Bryan Cox thought about having come close all season. ''If you get beat by 50 points,'' he said''you say'We got whupped.' If you get beat like thisyou say'Couldawouldashoulda.' ''

Who can blame the Jetsor their fansfor this kind of thinking?

''You think about the Oakland game,'' Chrebet said. That was a 1-point loss in a game in which the Jets had a 20-10 lead in the final period. With 26 seconds left the Raiders produced a touchdown for the victory.

That kind of numbing loss has battered the Jets repeatedly this year. It is a team with a defense that has given up fewer points than 23 other clubsand yet does not win its share of games. While the Jets' losses have come tantalizingly close to being victoriesthe victories have been struggles because of the diminished offense. The Jets have not won a game this season by more than 10 points.

Chrebet is still playingand so are Keyshawn Johnson and Curtis Martinwho is tied for the conference lead in rushing. ''No matter how many stars you haveyou have to mesh,'' Chrebet said. ''The worst thing to happen is a bunch of injuries at one position. Look at quarterbacklook at right tackle.''

From the moment Vinny Testaverde was injured in the opening gameeverything changed. Rick Mirer was triedthen Ray Lucasthen Mirer againthen Lucas again. Chrebet missed the first five games with a foot injury. Right tackle Jason Fabini's season ended with a knee injury in the ninth game. His replacementRyan Youngwas hurt in the next gameand Siupeli Malamala came out of retirement to start at the position last Sunday.
 3973,  1996, a, Mr. Goldhagen describes the members of Police Battalion 101a kind of reserve unit assigned to do police work in the conquered territoriesas ordinary German husbands and fathers. They were told by their commanders that they did not have to kill Jews. Stillthey entered into a "Dantesque production" of killingimmersing themselves in bloodand inviting their wives and children to watch. It wasMr. Goldhagen writesas if humanity had entered "a new moral order."

But their actionshe sayswere the result of a German society saturated with anti-Semitism. Even Karl Barththe Swiss theologian who taught in Germany in the early 30's and became an opponent of Nazismhad "a deep-seated anti-Semitism," Mr. Goldhagen writes. Barth denounced Jews in a 1933 sermon as "an obstinate and evil people," Mr. Goldhagen adds.

"Most anti-Semites just want to get Jews out of the countrybut to GermansJews were metaphysical enemies," Mr. Goldhagen said in his office. Some Germans protested the killing of PolesMr. Goldhagen notesand of handicapped peoplebut not of Jews. Even members of the anti-Hitler Resistance were anti-Semitic. Finallywhen Heinrich Himmlerchief of the SShoping to negotiate with Americans at the end of World War IIforbade the further killing of Jewssome Germans kept on.

In many waysMr. Goldhagen's book is a search for answers to unanswerable questions. He is the son of Erich Goldhagena survivor of the Romanian-Jewish ghetto in Czernowitznow in Ukraine. The elder Goldhagen recently retired as a professor from Harvardwhere for 25 years he taught a course on the Holocaust. Daniel Goldhagen dedicates his book to his fatherhis "constant discussion partner."

"My father said almost nothing about his own time," Daniel Goldhagen said. "It was simply very painful. He lost most of his extended family."

RecentlyErich Goldhagen said from Cambridge: "I'm a survivor. I don't like to talk about my experiences for obvious reasons." Yethe said"Our house was saturated in the subject." In the Goldhagen householdDaniel Goldhagen saidthe Holocaust was not a tale to lament. "The framework was intellectual."

The second oldest of four childrenDaniel Goldhagen grew up in NewtonMass.where he played high school basketball. "I still read the sports page first thing," he said.

Andrew M Cuomoleftwas sworn in Friday night as the 56th governor of New York.

The oath took effect at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.
 81,  2019, a, The other side of the ledger could be off as well. For examplethe $707 billion figure for universal child care factors in economic growth generated by the planbut under “static” scoring — without assuming any changes in growth — the cost is closer to $1.1 trillion. Similarlythe $470 billion estimate for free college tuition assumes that states would be willing to contribute the remaining one-third that the federal government does not fund.

What Ms. Warren Said

“My 2-cent wealth tax on the top one-tenth of 1 percent of the fortunes in this countryif we use just a piece of that money to forgive student loan debt for about 95 percent of those who have student loan debtthat has huge support among Democratsindependents and Republicans.”

— FairfaxVa.in May

True.

Several polls have found that Ms. Warren’s wealth tax plan has broad supportthough “huge” is a slight overstatement.

Of the respondents61 percent supported the proposal in a January survey commissioned by Data for Progressa left-leaning think tank. More Republicans supported the wealth tax than opposed it44 percent to 37 percentwhile 61 percent of independents and 76 percent of Democrats also endorsed it.

In a Morning Consult/Politico poll in February61 percent of all respondents were in favor of the wealth taxincluding 74 percent of Democrats and 50 percent of Republicans.

Polling that month from Survey Monkey for The New York Times produced similar results: 61 percent approval among all respondents75 percent among Democrats57 percent among independents and 51 percent among Republicans.

An April poll from Quinnipiac University found similar or higher levels of support among all respondents (60 percent)Democrats (82 percent) and independents (63 percent) but notably lower approval from Republicans (32 percent in support and 60 percent in opposition).

Past stance on pot

What Ms. Warren Said

“SoactuallyI supported Massachusetts changing its laws on marijuana. Massachusetts had decriminalized at that point and I thought it made a lot more sense for Massachusetts to go ahead and legalize marijuanaand I now support the legalization of marijuana.”

— CNN town-hall-style meeting in April

This is exaggerated.

When a student asked about her evolving position on marijuana legalizationMs. Warren overstated her past support.
 3081,  2001, a, To the Editor:

Re ''A Global Warning to Mr. Bush'' (editorialFeb. 26):

Not only does President Bush not seem to be interested or even aware of the real possibility of international calamities arising from global warminghe also seems inclined to foreclose on learning more about this phenomenon by cutting back on scientific research.

In the midst of talk about trillions of dollars of surplusesa minuscule increase -- in effect a decrease -- in financing for the National Science Foundationone of the major sources of research on global climate changeis tantamount to hiding one's head in the sand.

Stifling research on global warming will not make the phenomenon go away; it will just enable us to prolong our ignorance about it.

 7437,  1964, a, The Superintendent's announcement was made within hours after the Board of Educationwhose members have been critical of Dr. Gross issued a statement calling upon the Surecommendations to improve education.

The one‐sentence statement said:

“The Board of Educationin accordance with its continually expressed desire to improve the degree of quality education in underprivileged areashas requested the Superintendent of Schools to present to the board prior to the opening of school in September1964a realistic and feasible plan whereby there can be assured for the future a greater number of more experienced teachers and supervisors in those schools especially requirihg the services of such staff personnel and further thatto the extent feasiblethe implementation of such a plan commence with the opening of school in September1964.”

The board members have in the past privately criticized Dr. Gross for not exerting leadership and for failing to submit concrete plans for action.

Asked whether there was any connection between the board's statement and the announcement by Dr. Grossa spokesman for the school system replied that “it was just a coincidence.”

Dr. Gross later issued the following comment: “Better staffing of schools in disadvantaged areas has been a goal of the school system for a long time. It is unquestionably an urgent problem. The staff and I have been at work at it right along. The present situation calls for every possible bit of speed that can result in real and lasting improvement in the classrooms.

The 50‐year‐old former rider said he had been notified by officials in Mexico that the lifetime suspension he received there in 1945 for using profane language to track stewards was lifted on July 19.

Except for five days in 1950 when the state of Florida gave him a probationary license that he later returnedthe Mexican suspension has kept Meade out of racing in the United States because United States and Mexican racing bodies abide by each other's rulings.

Once Meade said that he would begin a comebackif he could win reinstatementby returning to the saddle in Mexico. But today he said that his age was against that.

 5798,  1985, a, A major witness testified yesterday that he played a part in creating a ''commission'' of Mafia leaders in Sicily after learning about a similar ruling group in the United States.

 202,  2018, a, But her submission also reminded me of how much can be learned when journalism becomes more communal and conversational. I would never have known about cakes like the “Maypole” or “Rocking Horse” — nor would I have known they were such cultural touchstones — if not for our attempt to throw open the doorsand invite in readers’ stories. Your stories.

Looking back over the past yearthere are so many things I wouldn’t have known if not for readers of this newsletter.

The responses to last week’s Australia Letter about history taught me just how common it was to grow up in Australia years ago without being taught Indigenous history — something I hadn’t realized since my own children are receiving more of that education in their public school.

If not for all of youI also wouldn’t have grasped the depth of appreciation for Nippersnor the nuance and divisions that shape discussions of race and multiculturalismor gender and power.

I would have missed out on many great booksrestaurantsmusic and movies that many of you suggested; I would have misunderstood the rivalry among Australia’s capital citiesor the degree to which people care so much about those that are often overlooked — I’m looking at you DarwinAdelaide and Perth — if not for those who wrote to tell us what they loved about where they livedand why.

I could go on but the point isfor our first anniversaryI’m not going to boast about all the journalism we did that I’m proud ofthough there’s a fair amount of that.

I’m just going to thank you for making the journalism better.

Foreign correspondence is nothing if not an attempt to understandand our bureau’s understanding of Australia — even for those who are Australian — has occurred at an accelerated pace thanks to you.

 3582,  1998, a, The owners of dogs that bark in New York City will face tougher sanctionsfemale golfers in Connecticut will gain new privileges at their country clubs and smokers in New Jersey will pay higher tobacco taxesas dozens of new laws take effect today in a mixed bag of new taxesrights and prohibitions.

In New York Statea law gives cats the same legal status as dogshorses and cattleat least when they are struck by a car or truck.

''Parity for cats is a great way to start the New Year,'' said Thomas P. DiNapolian assemblyman from Great Neck who sponsored the new law and describes himself as ''a cat person.''

The law increases the fine for hitting cats and leaving the scene to $100up from $25. A judge may order violators to pay up to $150 for a subsequent offense.
 4033,  1996, a, I want balance. I want fairness and I'm not finding it. That's a problem in many areas -- the judiciallegislative and executive branches. People have to force change and stop saying they can't make a difference. The so-called silent majority are people making less moneytheir quality of life is less. They're doing exactly what the Governor says they should doworking twothree and four jobs.

Q. Is the solution to create new jobs?

A. No! We should share in productivity.

Productivity is at an all-time high. What made this country great was when we went from a 12-hour day7 days a weekto reducing our work day and reducing our work week. We abolished child labor. We shared in productivity.

We believe in capital and that business has a right to profit. We also believe as workers that we are part of and deserve to share in that productivity. How do you do that? With higher wages or fewer hours.

What we're seeing is the stock market at an all-time highcorporate salaries at an all-time high and corporate profits at an all-time high but we see stagnation. In factwe see a reduction in real purchasing power. We are 16th in wages in the world.

Q. Are immigrant workers taking American jobs?

A. Business is trying to turn us against each other. Those people are not our enemy. To think that my miserymy problems are because of the guy over here is wrong.

There's a certain amount of racism here. We are concerned about the Mexican border or about who's coming into Florida. When is the last time anyone complained about illegal Irish immigrants? Whether we be IrishPolishAfrican-American or Hispanicwe are not each other's enemies. This is a country that can continue to accept people. Rather than working three or four jobsmaybe the new immigrant can have one of those jobs.

Q. And the jobs that are lost to foreign factories?

A. If we're going to be a superpowera morally responsible player in the world scenethen we have to recognize that we cannot exploit other people and have a safe and good world for ourselves and our sons and daughters.

Mr. Yeltsinwho is 65 and has a long history of health problemshas not been seen in public since Wednesday. He missed his last major chance to campaign todaywhen he did not appear at a large party sponsored by a Moscow newspaper to which he had been invited. By lawcampaigning must stop on Monday.

Mr. Yeltsin traveled from his country home outside the capital on Saturday for a short working day in the Kremlin. Television news programs showed him smiling but looking weary and weak.

His Communist opponentGennadi A. Zyuganovhas seized on his virtual disappearance from view to remind voters how frail Mr. Yeltsinwho has had two serious episodes of heart disease in the last yearoften seems.

 4958,  1990, a, 'An Excuse for Failure'

Mr. Gillwhose commission was created by former Mayor Edward I. Koch and the Board of Education in the wake of a series of disclosures about school corruptionattacked the central boardits bureaucracy and its leadership for what he said was a desire to use the decentralization of the system 20 years ago into 32 local districts ''as an excuse for failure.''

''They seem to have believed that they could just let those districts stew in their own juicesjust send them a memo or directive once in a blue moon and then let them sink or swim on their own,'' Mr. Gill said.

But even more startling was the attack on Mr. Wagner. The son of a former New York City Mayorthe grandson of a former United States Senator and a confidant of Mr. KochMr. Wagner has been been one of the city's most prominent political fixtures for two decades and played a key role in appointing both the commission and Mr. Gill. By picturing himself as a reformer intent on overhauling a shabby school systemhe has generally been able to elude the criticism that regularly befalls that system. His term as board presidenta part-time position for which he is paid $20,000 a yearexpires at the end of this month. In an interview yesterdayMr. Wagnerboard president since January 1986dismissed much of the criticism as unfairsaying Mr. Gill was attacking failings that he and the other board members can do little about. He spoke of his battle for legislation that would abolish the Board of Examinersthe agency that tests and licenses teachersand give the chancellor a greater role in choosing district superintendents.

Mr. Gill said Mr. Wagner was ''very dedicated'' and his ''heart was in the right place.'' Buthe saidhe and the rest of the board were ''lumbering'' along and had not even responded promptly to repeated findings by his commission of corruption and inefficiency within the school system.

Criticism on Sofarelli

Mr. Wagnerhe saiddid not dismiss his Inspector GeneralMichael Sofarellieven though the commission revealed significant inadequacies in how the office conducted its investigations of wrongdoing by employees. ''Why would you want to continue a guy who has run the office in the way he had run it,'' Mr. Gill said in an interview. Mr. Wagnerhe saidalso did not ''exert his influence'' to obtain the removal of the chief investigator for the Board of Examiners after the commission exposed serious flaws in the screening process for new teachers. That processMr. Gill saidpermitted a teacher convicted of sexual abuse to get appointed to a Bronx junior high school.

While most reports in Britain on the publication of Tony’s Blair’s new memoir have focused on his frank assessment of the weaknesses of his successorGordon Brownone newspaper notes that there are also some recollections that might make another old friendformer President George W. Bushuncomfortable. The Telegraph reports:

In his new bookA JourneyMr Blair writes that the former U.S. president was confused by the presence of Guy Verhofstadt at the 2001 G-8 summit in Genoa. “He didn’t know or recognize Guywhose advice he listened to with considerable astonishment,” Mr Blair writes. “He then turned to me and whispered‘Who is this guy?’ ‘He is the prime minister of Belgium,’ I said.



Mr. Bush soon became better acquainted with the Belgian leaderwho visited the White House later that year and again in 2006when my colleague Stephen Crowley captured this triptych of Mr. Verhofstadt making the American president laugh while recounting a mountain biking tale:

 6084,  1977, a, Comptroller Harrison J. Goldincharges that New York City's emergency repair program for rundown housing is riddled with mismanagement and ineptness by city agencies and with excessive charges And poor work by contractorscausing a loss of half the $7.5 million spent on the program last year.

In an audit of the program completed last weekbut not yet generally made publicMr. Goldin described the program in terms .similar to those used by Mayor Beame when he was the Comptroller in 1972.

At that timeduring the majoralty of John V. Lindsaythe emergency repair program was mired in scandalswhich included charges of questionable contract arrangementsloose procedures and overpayments for work. Steps were subsequently taken that were designed to remove the abuses.

The programdating from 1965seeks to restore essential services and remove dangerous conditions when private landlords fail to do so in their apartment buildings. The city hires contractors to do the jobs and then seeks to recoup the costs from the landlords.
 1962,  2008, a, Paris’s labyrinthine underground Les Halles marketplace is about to get a new destination that even American visitors will be able to ask for by name. Cinema Street (known locally as “Rue de Cinema”) will be dedicated on Friday by Mayor Bertrand DelanoëAgence France-Presse reportedto celebrate the completion of renovations on the marketplace’s historic Forum des Images movie theater. The street offers visitors a modern 16-screen multiplex cinema and a library named for the director François Truffautwith a collection of 17,000 books and 10,000 DVDs; the renovated Forum will also have a vault of 5,500 filmsall newly transferred to digital format. “This is the first time that a city has said to itself that its memory does not only exist in books but also in images,” Laurence Herszbergthe director of the Forumtold Agence France-Presse.
 700,  2015, a, The 1974 Canadian-produced “Black Christmas” offended pious sensibilities with a serial-murder-on-a-silent-night theme; in 1977the Ontario-born director David Cronenberg took dry glee in the accidental machine gunning of a shopping mall Santa in his “Rabid.” Canada’s scary-movie war on Christmas is taken up once more in “A Christmas Horror Story,” a quasi omnibus of horror scenarios requiring no fewer than three directors (Grant HarveySteven Hoban and Brett Sullivan) to deck its halls. Unsparingly gory and on occasion actually shock-inducingit can’t help falling prey to Genre Overreach syndromein which horror fans turned horror creators maniacally pile up their favorite terrorizing tropesas if they’d never get the chance again.

William Shatner’s virtually phoned-in turn as a Christmas Eve D.J. ties the proceedings togetheror as together as they can getand his character provides the requisite nod to a John Carpenter film (in this case“The Fog”). A story line involving a “changeling” never rises above the promising. Another that culminates in a nice teenage girl’s turning all sex-crazed is too tiresome to be redeemed by its ultimate gruesomeness.

And the most initially risible of the storiesinvolving an anti-Santa called Krampus and featuring deathless dialoguelike “Elves becoming the walking dead? Noit does not make sense,” winds up having the most effectively diabolical payoff of the bunch. Nevertheless — or perhaps the proper word here is “therefore” — the picture can be wholly recommended only to not-too-demanding horror junkies who’ve been successfully nurturing their inner adolescents since the late 1970s.

 5597,  1986, a, Federal officials say that rabies is now widespread in Maryland and Pennsylvaniaand they fear its steady advance will reach the suburbs of Philadelphia in a year. The same outbreak of the disease has also reached epidemic proportions in South CarolinaGeorgia and Florida.

The East Coast epidemic is one of two in the country. Anothercarried by skunkshas spread the disease from Texas north to Minnesota and from Kentucky west to the Dakotasaccording to the Centers for Disease Control. In additionrabies is common in bats in much of the country.

There were 5,599 confirmed cases of rabid animals in the country last yearaccording to the centersmore than twice the 2,675 reported in 1975. So far this year2,382 cases have been reportedwhich the Centers for Disease Control said was slightly ahead of last year's rate.

Dr. Fishbein attributed part of the risehoweverto better reporting and record-keeping.

As the disease spreads into more densely populated areashowevercontact between rabid animals and humans is becoming increasingly common. These are among recent incidents:

* A 15-year-old girl was bitten in the leg in March by a raccoon while sitting on her porch in HanoverPa.

* More than 30 people were exposed when they played with a rabid kitten on two farms in Frederick CountyMd. The kitten also bit a New Jersey woman at a gift shopthrough her boot. Health officials conducted a vast but unsuccessful search for the womanwhose name was not known to the officials.

* A 6-year-old boy was bitten by a groundhog while waiting for a school bus in York County.

* An 87-year-old man was bitten by the family's pet donkey in central Pennsylvania. The man and all emergency room personnel who helped treat his deep wound had to be vaccinated.

Such incidents have caused alarm in the region's tiny townswhose residents rarely vaccinate their pets and often allow them to roam. Local officials report an increase in the number of abandoned animals and at least one case of what they described as ''panic.'' Group Forms to Get Cat

The quilts that represented Rosie Lee Tompkins in the Whitney Biennial last spring did not do her work full justice. But its greatness shines forth undiluted in her New York gallery debutwhich shows 11 quilts dating from 1986 to 2002. Unerring and intuitive in their sense of colorshape and scaleMs. Tompkins's quilts are formidably joyful visual events that ignore the usual boundaries between cultureshistories and mediums.

They belong to the history of European modernism and African-American quilting20th-century textiles and 20th-century painting. They connect to African textilesespecially the bark cloth paintings of the Kuba and the Ituri of Central Africaand also to music. Their improvisational finesse has been rightly compared to jazzbut Bach's spiritual architectonics are also pertinent.

Their animated compositions have been likened to the paintings of Hans HofmannAlfred Jensen and Howard Hodgkin; but Josef AlbersStuart DavisKlee and late Mondrian also come to mind. So do the trippy mutating arrangements of computer artists like John R. Simonthe textiles of Anni Albers and the little-known appliqué paintings of Eve Peri.

Ms. Tompkins was born in 1936lives in the Bay Area and uses a pseudonym to protect her privacy. She learned her craft as a child in eastern Arkansas helping her mother piece quiltsand says that God guides her work. Although known to specialists in African and African-American art since the early 1990'sher achievement was brought to wider art world attention by Lawrence Rinderwho organized a show of her work at the art museum at the University of California at Berkeley in 1997 and then put it in the 2002 Whitney Biennial.

 4202,  1995, a, Since the 1970'sthe Queens Museum of Art has held biennial or triennial exhibitions of work by artists based in Queens. The most recent entry in this series"Live/Work in Queens," reflects the borough's transformation into what the show's curatorChristina Yangcalls "the nation's most diverse county," one that includes more than 70 ethnic groups speaking almost 200 different languages. Four of the eight artists in the show were born in the United Statesbut the others come from ColombiaChinaKorea and Afghanistan. Not surprisinglythe exhibition seems to revolve around the theme of ethnic identity.

The problem is that the artistic representation of ethnicity too often turns into self-caricature. The relief paintings of Esperanza Cortesfor instanceevoke the image of the Hispanic woman as wifemother and martyr by means of an all-too-familiar vocabulary of fractured body parts rendered with sugary realism. Artists should either come to grips with the sado-masochistic subtext of this imagery or -- better yet -- give it a rest.

Katherine O'Connor's black-and-white photographs of the Irish village from which her father emigrated are full of soulfulmelancholy faces whose lines and creases reveal their long struggle with mortality and the elements. This nostalgic view of life in the Old Country is rendered in a pseudo-clinical style that recalls photographers like Nicholas Nixon and Larry Fink but that lacks their formal wit and daring.

Other artists here take a more indirect approach to identity. Amanullah Haiderzadwho left Afghanistan after the Soviet invasion of 1980makes iron sculptures that echo the characters of Arabic calligraphy without literally reproducing them. Their planarstrongly textured forms are curiously reminiscent of work by such American sculptors of the 1940's and 50's as David SmithHerbert Ferber and Seymour Lipton.

 259,  2018, a, “One franc,” Mr. Aznavour said. “After that I was able to tell my friends I was better paid than Piaf.”

In 1958the French government lifted a longstanding ban on allowing some of Mr. Aznavour’s more explicit songs — like “Après l’Amour,” which recounts the aftermath of an episode of lovemaking — on the radio. “I was the first to write about social issues like homosexuality,” Mr. Aznavour told The Times in 2006referring to his 1972 song “What Makes a Man?” “I find real subjects and translate them into song.”

He returned to New York in 1963 and rented Carnegie Hallwhere he performed to a packed house. (Among those in the audience was Bob Dylanwho later said it was one of the greatest live performances he had ever witnessed.) A triumphant world tour followed.

Thereafterthe United States became a second home. Mr. Aznavour performed all over the countryoften with Liza Minnelli. He became a fixture in Las Vegas for a time and there married Ulla Thorsella former modelin 1967. She was his third wife.

Mr. Aznavour had six children. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.

As a childMr. Aznavour watched his father go broke feeding penniless Armenian refugees in his restaurant. As his fame grewhe became a spokesman and fund-raiser for the Armenian cause. He organized help worldwide after an earthquake killed 45,000 people in Armenia in 1988. And when the country broke away from the crumbling Soviet Union in 1991it made him an unofficial ambassador. He displayed the Corps Diplomatique plaque on his car as proudly as he wore the French Legion of Honor ribbon in his lapel.

 2754,  2003, a, To the Editor:

In ''Matters of Emphasis'' (columnApril 29)Paul Krugman says he believes that we'll ''eventually find some poison gas or crude biological weapons'' in Iraqbut not ''true W.M.D.'s.''

Isn't ''crude biological weapon'' an oxymoron? Would the tiny amounts of anthrax that gripped us with fear be a crude biological weapon?

I would agree that President Bush pushed some buttons by emphasizing certain matters as the pretext for warbut while Mr. Krugman sees this as dishonestI see it simply as necessary given the circumstances.

 3710,  1998, a, ''That is certainly the poltergeist energy that contributes to this radical vortex,'' he explained.

Mr. Levitch was treating a reporter to his personal take on the wondrous island of Manhattancradle to so many eccentrics like him. But his exuberantly articulated vision was more than just another oddball perspective; it was the warped window through which thousands of visitors over the last seven years have first glimpsed New York City.

Mr. Levitch28may well be the most unorthodoxunusual tour guide the city has ever spawneda distinction confirmed by the upcoming release of a feature-length documentary that focuses exclusively on him and principally on his long stint as an employee atop double-decker buses.

The movie''The Cruise,'' is scheduled to open on Oct. 23 at the Angelika Film Center in the Village. For a documentary to get a commercial theatrical release is atypical -- an immediate badge of success -- but ''The Cruise'' has also attracted sizeable audiences and garnered extremely positive reviews at the screenings and film festivals where it has been shown in the last few months.

And it has already begun to turn Mr. Levitch into something of a demi-celebrity and cult figure -- for the next 15 minutesat least -- with friends in the movie industrya literary agent and a budding business in privately arranged walking tours. He quit the double-decker scene a year ago but still takes small groups around Manhattan on foot.

That isif they can find him. He has not had a permanent residence since 1992relying instead on the hospitality of friends to support a mode of living he refers to as ''couch surfing.'' It prompts him to evaluate new acquaintances in idiosyncratic ways.

SUNDAY PUZZLE — A very literal puzzle today from Matt Ginsbergwhere the circled squares do exactly what the entire phrase describes. I do love an obedient crossword puzzle.

In the 11 theme entriesMr. Ginsberg CALLs BACK(ward)SPLITs a SECONDtears TO SHREDS (inside the base phrase TORN TO SHREDS) to shredsMINCEs MEATtakes the word DRIFT APARTSCRAMBLEs EGGS by anagramming themand so on. I won’t spoil all the fun for you. Just remember to do what the base phrase tells you to doand you will be just fine.

Clue of the Day for me was “Something to pay through?” which totally made the partial THE NOSE better.

Let’s hear from Mr. Ginsberg:

Constructor’s Notes:

It’s always interesting to see what happens to my puzzles between submission and appearance. On this puzzleI clued all the horizontal words with circles as — SMALL SPOILER ALERT — simply [See circled letters]. But Will decided to make it a bit easier. I’m not sure who was right; my clue was used in a similar “Kangaroo words” puzzle in the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament one yearalthough that puzzle was somewhat more straightforwardcluingfor example“israELi AirLine” as [See circled letters]. So this would have been a bit trickier. I thought of the theme itself while sitting in church one Sunday. I spent the rest of the service trying to think of examples to use. This was good because I stayed awake but bad because I didn’t pay attention to the sermon. There was no test afterwardso it all worked out O.K.. MeanwhileI seem to be losing my touch a bit on the cluing sideas many of the clues that I thought were clever or topical didn’t make the editorial cut. I used [Seahawks’ star Marshawn] for 21-Down and [Berryrepeatedly] for 44-Down. I used [Disney actor] for 67-Down in light of the (fairly) recent film. Perhaps I am simply too old to recognize topical when I see it. (I must confess that I transitioned from one A.C.P.T. age division to another a couple of weeks ago.) Not that I will ever competeof course. And Dr.Fill remains comfortably in the “Juniors” bracket. If you want to see Dr.Fill solving today’s puzzlehere it is. I apologize for all the video flashing and whatnot; it’s courtesy of my Mac’s upgrade to Yosemite. I’ll try and track it down before the next tournament. Not surprisinglyDr.Fill does pretty well on this puzzlesince all of the fill consists of actual words or phrases. It makes a few mistakes early onbut it has no trouble correcting them. The solution is found in well under a minutebut it then spends bit of time checking its work and looking for a theme or rebus possibility before announcing that it is done. Correctly solved in a bit under two minutes. I hope everyone enjoyed the puzzle!

Let’s say THANK U to Mr. Ginsberg and move on to the Monday puzzle.

 6210,  1975, a, The Beame administration yesterday ruled out using the $200 million in new tax revenues to cancel any of the $200 million worth of layoffs and reduced services ordered earlier this yearbefore the new taxes were forced on the city.

First Deputy Mayor‐designate John E. Zuccotti said the extra revenuesapproved la,st week as part of the latest fiscal rescue of the city would be used to reduce the deficit that still existednot to rebuild the payroll or spare threatened day‐care centers and other popular services.that are scheduled to be closed.

“Regardless of the increased revenueswe intend to go forward with a $200 million budget‐reduction package,” he declaredemphasizing the priority of making budget cuts totaling $725 million in three annual reductions so that the imbalance of the city's budget can be ended by mid‐1978.

While Mr. Zuccotti was explaining the city's plans for its new revenuesCongress was preparing to enact the Federal legislation that is the other major ingredient in the current package to avert default. The House is expected to approve today President Ford's proposal for $2.3 billion in Federal loans to the city. [Page 78.]

 5669,  1985, a, New York State's highest court yesterday upheld the State Constitution's requirement that judges retire at the end of the year they turn 70 years old.

In a unanimous decisionthe Court of Appeals ruled that laws differentiating on the basis of agerather than such factors as race or religionneed only serve a legitimate state interest to be sustained. And mandatory retirement laws for judgesthe court held''manifestly have a rational basis.''

As a result of the decisionat least 22 judges who turned 70 in 1984including four Civil Court judges in New York City who filed the court challengeretired last night. In some casestheir successors had already been electedand the Appeals Court's rapid disposition of the case was designed to prevent confusion.

Supreme Court Ruling Voided

The court heard arguments in the case in a rare Saturday session last weekendless than two weeks after a justice of State Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled that the provision violated Federal constitutional guarantees of due process and equal protection of the laws.

 2239,  2006, a, Anyone who has traveled to Europe in the summertime knows that a large chunk of the Continent seems to be on vacation on any given day. This is part of the problem facing the clutch of United States-based private equity firms who are hoping to stage an initial public offering overseasaccording to a story from Reuters.

Buyout shops such as Texas Pacific Group and Blackstone hope to follow the lead of Kohlberg Kravis Robertswhich recently raised $5 billion — three times the amount it originally expected — through a listing on the Euronext exchange. But the slow season is comingand no one is sure if investors will be so receptive to a private equity I.P.O. several months from now.

One lawyer sums the situation up this way:

“If anythingthe market will determine the appetite for this type of product,” said Jeffrey Tabaka lawyer for WeilGotshal & Manges who specializes in fund raising. “From a timing perspectivesummer is a more difficult time to raise moneyespecially in Europe. Will the interest still be there after Labor Day?”

Meanwhilethe anonymous private equity professional who runs the Going Private blog has been offering an interesting rundown of the prospectus for KKR’s European I.P.O. The latest entry describes a handy tax break that KKR discovered in the tiny nation of Luxembourg.

 364,  2017, a, To the Editor:

The online headline for a Sunday Review news analysis on June 25 was “Men Don’t Want to Be Nurses. Their Wives Agree.”

I can say that after 40 years nursing continues to be a fulfilling professionand my wife agrees. My sonmy soon-to-be son-in-law and my nephew value their decision to become nursesas do their spouses.

Men should look at nursing as a career choice that provides security while offering a continuously rewarding opportunity in specialties like palliativeprimarytrauma and critical carewhere nurses ease suffering and make a true difference in people’s lives.

DAVID VLAHOVSAN FRANCISCO

The writer is a professor of nursing and associate dean for research at the Yale School of Nursing.
 4990,  1990, a, ''We just have to take a few steps backward,'' Courrege said''and evaluate where we are and where the Giants are. They have to change their offer for Lawrence to come in. Maybe ours has to changetoo.''

This is the option year of a seven-year contract Taylor signed in 1984. That means he is under contract. Stillhe has refused to report until he gets a contract extension.

Parcells Wants Him for Eagles

Coach Bill Parcells said he did not know how long it would take Taylor to get into game shape until he saw Taylor's fitness condition. Taylor has always said that he stays in shape by playing golf. Parcells indicated that Taylor would play against the Eagles if he reported any time between now and the game.

In an hourlong interviewCourrege said both sides were willing to negotiate a three-year contract that would cover the 19901991 and 1992 seasons. But he said differences remained over how much money Taylor would receive and how it would be paid. Partly for tax purposeshe saidTaylor wants the payments spread over 10 to 20 years. Courrege said that last week he asked the Giants for a four-year deal worth $9 million.

He said the Giants had offered $4.25 million over three years and had come up ''a few hundred thousand dollars.'' He also said he had reduced his asking price. It is believed to be slightly less than $2 million a year.

Upper Echelon

Taylor indicated previously that he would accept close to $2 million a year over three years. That salary would easily make him the highest-paid defensive player in pro football history. Only a few quarterbacks make more.

''We think Lawrence is legitimately a $2 million player,'' Courrege said. ''But they're worried about the spiral effect. I told George when players come in and say they want what Lawrence getshe should tell them when you go to the Pro Bowl nine straight years including your rookie yearyou will get the same money.''
 4808,  1991, a, In some waysthe Clash of the Titans tour that arrived on Friday night at Madison Square Garden could be the belated triumph of punk-rock. As AnthraxSlayer and Megadeth playeda full houseat least two-thirds of whom were wearing black T-shirtsshouted along with lines like Anthrax's "You're anti -- you're antisocial!" or "Ain't gonna live my life this way!" From a more cynical viewpointit was an example of rebellion as commoditystandardized in sound (a pummeling beatminor chordschantlike vocals)appearance (long hairjeans and T-shirtsor bare chests) and action (flopping that long hair to the beat).

But for all its commercialismthe musicknown as thrash or speed-metalhas genuine power. The beat and guitarssimultaneously hyperactive and one-dimensionalare a perfect musical metaphor for enraged frustrationwhile speed-metal lyrics don't bother with any of pop's consolationslike love. During the four-hour concertfans stomped and shouted along with lyrics about fighting racism (Anthrax's "Keep It in the Family")censorship (Megadeth's "Hook in Mouth") or dying on the battlefield (Slayer's "Mandatory Suicide"). Thrash recognizesand tries to exorcisethe malevolent powers that greet adolescents on the verge of adulthoodoften with lyrics that switch from the perspective of victim to victimizer. In concertwords are often lost in the roarbut that hardly matters; fans have learned them from the albums' lyric sheets.

While the music has strict parameterseach band adds its own shadings. Anthrax is least hemmed in by thrash conventions. There's a certain jaunty Little Rascals aura to the band as members race around the stage and the lead singerJoe Belladonnaworks the crowd like a cheerleader. Anthrax's guitaristScott Ianhas a shaved head and baggy shorts that come from the wardrobe of hardcore rock; Anthrax also ventures into styles outside thrashincluding the pop of Joe Jackson's "Got the Time," the rap of "I'm a Man" (which sounds like a Beastie Boys imitation) and a new efforta version of Public Enemy's "Bring the Noise" with blaring guitar backup. For the encoreAnthrax was joined by Chuck D. and Flavor-Flav of Public Enemywho leaped around the stage to rival the members of Anthrax.

Where Anthrax is relatively eclecticSlayer is purist; it plays poundingcrushing thrash -- half-speedregular and double-time -- behind Tom Araya's savage growlwhile its lead guitars wail between verses. Slayer has a gimmick; it writes about death and Satanic ritualspiling on horrific details but neither praising nor condemning themwith lines like "I rule this inferno/Enthroned for eternity."
 2924,  2002, a, Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.

Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lessonstudents investigate artificially elevated regions or cities around the world to compare historiesculturesand strategies related to potential flooding disaster.



Author(s):

Annissa HambouzThe New York Times Learning Network

Javaid KhanThe Bank Street College of Education in New York City

Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes – one hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Speculate about their vulnerability to a natural disaster; speculate about their potential reactions to an impending natural disaster.

2. Examine New Orleans’s risk of flood disaster by reading and discussing the article “Nothing’s Easy for New Orleans Flood Control.”

3. Compare the New Orleans’s case to other cities or regions around the world vulnerable to the threat of floods through in-class research.

4. Create three-dimensional models of the flood-prone regions.

Resources / Materials:

-pens/pencils

-paper

-student journals

-classroom blackboard

-copies of “Nothing’s Easy for New Orleans Flood Control” (one per student)

-geography resources (textbooksencyclopediascomputers with Internet access)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: In their journalsstudents respond to the following prompt (written on the board prior to class): “To what types of natural disasters do you think your town or region might be vulnerable? If you were given a few days’ warning of an impending natural disasterhow do you think you might prepare? How would you react if meteorological predictions regarding the impending disaster were unclear and some people dismissed the warnings as ‘exaggerations’?” Allow students to share responses briefly.

2. As a classread and discuss the article “Nothing’s Easy for New Orleans Flood Control,” focusing on the following questions:

a. Between which bodies of water does New Orleans lie?

b. What might happen if a hurricane from the Gulf of Mexico reached New Orleans?

c. What measures has the city taken to prevent such a disaster from occurring?

d. Who is Dr. Suhayda?

e. What types of hypothetical flooding situations are scientists researching?

f. What are some proposed methods of preventing future catastrophes?

g. What is the “community haven” concept?

h. What makes the city of New Orleans particularly vulnerable to experiencing a natural disaster?

i. How has the city’s development added to its vulnerability?

j. What does the reporter liken to “spider webs” and a “witches’ brew”?

k. Who is Dr. van Heerden?

l. According to Dr. van Heerdenwhat would New Orleans’s “worst case situation” be?

m. How much might that worst case scenario cost the city?

n. When is hurricane season?

o. What are the chances of a disastrous hurricane striking the city?

p. How does the American Red Cross treat the threat of disaster in New Orleans?

3. Divide students into groupsand assign each a flood-prone geographical location to research. Choose regions or cities you have studied. Suggestions include: New Orleansthe Netherlands (Zeeland and Ijselmeer)Bangladeshand Thailand (Bangkok). Using all available resourceseach group conducts basic research about their assigned regionsummarizing the following aspects of the area (written on the board for easier student access):

–Body of water or meteorological challenge to the region

–History of city’s or region’s development

–Cultural aspects connected to the flood-prone nature of the region (Dutch “man vs. water” literaturecolloquial expressionsetc.)

–Transportation

–Past solutions in times of flooding

–Current solutions in times of flooding

–Future plans to prevent further destruction from flooding

–Current and projected costs of flood control

Groups should write a “fact sheet” for their region or city based on their research.

4. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK Each student creates a three-dimensionaltopographical representation of their city or region to accompany the group’s fact sheet completed in class. In a future classeach group can present an assessment of their region’s level of preparation in the event of a flood. Different scenarios can be illustrated by using the graphic representations of the regions that were created for the homework assignment.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–Do you think it is worth it for the city of New Orleans to spend millions of dollars preparing for a disaster that might never occur?

–Do you think New Orleans will have difficulty maintaining its status as a residential and tourist destination once its status as “disaster prone” gains more public attention? Why or why not?

–Would you consider moving to a disaster-vulnerable region or city? Why or why not?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on written journal responsesthoughtful participation in class discussionsgroup researchand presentation of three-dimensional maps.

Vocabulary:

leveessurgepropelledprohibitivegeologicalmeteorologicalsultryhypotheticalevacuationbluntmarshlandssedimenterodedbarrierdeltadredgedcontainershipcrucialperilpimentometaphoricpetrochemicalmorassincalculablecataclysmic

Extension Activities:

1. Choose two or three sites of past natural disasters where residents were warned of potential danger in advance. Write an investigative report about how people prepared or did not prepare for the disaster.

2. New Orleans is known for its famous “Mardi Gras” celebrations. Research the history behind the “Shrove Tuesday” holiday and compare the festivities in New Orleans to “Fasching” in Switzerland and “Carnival” in Brazil. Create a collage that combines images from each of these celebrations.

3. How were the early river valley civilizations affected by floods? Compare IndusNileYellowTigris and Euphrates civilizations. How did floods affect these cultures and belief systems? Present your findings in an illustrated chart.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Research New Orleans history. How did the city develop? Who were its original inhabitants? What role did it play in the development of colonial America? Make a timeline of key events.

Economics- Choose three recent natural disasters and three examples of human-made catastrophes (acts of war or terrorismetc.). Compare the estimated damages of each eventthen plot and graph these figures along with the amount of aid or assistance received in the aftermath of the disasters.

Language Arts- Design a disaster response brochure for children in the event of a dangerous flood. Explain how to prepare for a floodand illustrate your steps with drawings.

Science- This article mentions potential water contamination as a result of floods. How is water tested? Make a “How it Works” chart explaining the process by which water is tested for chemical composition and contamination.

 4737,  1991, a, It may well make sense to interpret the flight of Iraq's most modern fighter planes to Iran in this context. While American and other Western military analysts speculated about what initially seemed a large-scale Iraqi defectionseveral Saudi military officers quietly argued that the pilots had flown to Iran to prevent the allies from destroying the planes on the groundas Israel did nearly 24 years ago.

Apart from the relief expressed here that another Arab leader had not been humiliated at the hands of the Westthere is a deep conviction in RiyadhCairo and Damascus that Iraq must not be destroyed or dismembered in an effort to free Kuwait.

Baghdad is seen as a bulwark against the reassertion of Iranian influence in the regionsomething feared by Saudi Arabia and other countries with Sunni Muslim majorities. Animosity between Iranian Shiite Muslims and the Sunni Muslim world intensified duirng the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq. Most gulf nations with sizable Shiite populations experienced an increase in terrorist attacks and attempts during the war. A Postwar Role for Baghdad

The conviction that Iraq should be preserved as a regional military power under new management was reflected in a statement issued Wednesday by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and President Hosni Mubarak of Egyptwho met in the Red Sea port of Jidda for several hours. The two reiterated their call to Mr. Hussein to withdraw and spare his country further devastation. They said an immediate cease-fire was possible if the Iraqi leadereven at this late datesignaled his intention to withdraw from Kuwait.

Representatives of both countries have emphasized that the goal of the war was only to free Kuwait from Iraqi control. In a recent interview broadcast on the BBCEgypt's Minister of State for Foreign AffairsButros Ghaliunderscored the point by asserting that Egypt could coexist with any Iraqi Government that removed its forces from Kuwaiteven one headed by Mr. Hussein.

The announcement came right after Baltimore’s chief prosecutor received the ruling that Freddie Gray’s death was a homicide. Marilyn Mosby charged six police officers with a range of crimesincluding one count of murder and six of manslaughter.
 1988,  2007, a, A warm welcome to our great friend the esteemed Judge Kay and all the members of the Court of Appeals. A warm welcome to all those joining me in being sworn in today. Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and my partnerLieutenant Governor David Paterson.

My deepest thanks are to my parents; my wifeSildaand our three wonderful daughters.

Todaywe come together to mark a pivotal moment in our state’s historya day that in the rhythm of democracy marks a transition and a new beginning.

It is with profound humility about the task that lies before us and filled with great hope for what I know we will achievethat I stand before you to announce that Day One of our time for change has arrived.

As we step outside on this first January morning of 2007the light of a new day shines down on the Empire State once again.

The opportunity at the heart of this day is unique to our timesbut not new to our history. As the writer Russell Shorto has aptly notedNew York created the model for the kind of society that would be duplicated throughout the country and around the globe: Our state was born as an island at the center of the world.

What began as a babble of dialects and peoples struggling to find a way to live togethersearching for balance between chaos and orderliberty and oppressionbecame a symphony of democracy.

Under the shadow of liberty’s torchgenerations of weary travelers have sailed into New York harbor believing that of all the places on Earththis was the land where people could come and find the chance to make their world anew.

That no matter how great the hardshipno matter how daunting the challengethe promise of our democracy makes it possible to overcome the greatest odds so that we — individually and as a society — may arrive at a greater good.

And so it was for those first immigrants who came with little and worked long days to give their children a better life.

For the bold governorDewitt Clintonwho ignored the warnings of the skeptics and cynics and built an Erie Canal that so many had said was wastefulimpracticaland impossible.

For the reformers of Teddy Roosevelt’s day who dared to take on the political machine and inbred corruption in order to give government back to the people.

For the suffragists and union members and civil rights heroes who organized and marched on our streets to win their chance at the American dream.

For the inventorsartists and entrepreneurs who have turned our state into a beacon of hopeideas and opportunity.

And so it must be for us. Like all who have come beforewe have arrived at this moment on this day because we have demanded a different and more vibrant future for our children.

Because we know that New York is the state where the depth of our talent and the breadth of our skills and the reach of our culture have forever changed America and the entire world — and because we know we can do it once more.

This election was not about electing one person as governor. Rather it was about what we the people collectively elected for the future of our state.

We chose pragmatism and ethics over partisan politics and dysfunctionand we demanded an end to gridlock.

So I pledge to toil each and every day so as not to disappoint the hard working people of this state who have placed their trust in this future — a future which rekindles hope and restores growth.

Today we stand in the midst of a global revolution that has transformed the way we live and the way we work. Creativity and prosperity travel wherever the brightest minds and most innovative economies can be found.

Over the last decadewe have seen what can happen when our government stands still in the face of great challenge and inevitable change.

We’ve seen it in the burdensome property taxes and the health care we can’t afford; in the jobs that have disappeared from our upstate cities and the schools that keep failing our children; in a government that works for those who hold office — not those who put them there.

Like Rip Van Winklethe legendary character created by the New York author Washington IrvingNew York has slept through much of the past decade while the rest of the world has passed us by.

Today is the day when all of that changes — when we stop standing still and start moving forward once more.

And while I wish I could tell you that either a single election or a different party or even a new governor alone is enough to do this — I cannot. While I wish I could tell you that change will be easy — I don’t believe that you elected me to do what’s easy.

Easy is spending your tax dollars without consequence or sacrifice. Easy is saying yes to supporters and no to opponents. Easy is looking the other way while costs risedebts mount and families lose ground. Easy is what we’ve hadbut easy is not where we need to go.

Let us remember the lessons of two great governorsTheodore and Franklin Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt instructed“It is only through labor and painful effortby grim energy and resolute courage that we move on to better things.”

And Franklin Roosevelt advised us to be“bold,” and to recognize that people demand “actionand action now.”

I have no doubt that we can move on to better things in this state — that we will find ourselves on the winning side of history once more.

But to be number one againwe must be one New York again.

And so in order to return to policies of opportunity and prosperitywe must change the ethics of Albany and end the politics of cynicism and division in our state.

If ever there was a time that called out for introspection by those in governmentit is now. Lincoln spoke of listening to “the better angels of our nature.” Indeedthose of us who work in the great building behind me must hear and heed the serious responsibility that public service demands and rise to this moment and show the public in words and in deeds that we understand that our responsibility is to the people of New York.

The reform we seek is substantial in size and historic in scope.

It will require a new brand of politics — a break from the days when progress was measured by the partisan points scored or the opponents defeated. No longer can we afford merely to tinker at the margins of the status quo or play the politics of pitting one group against another. We must replace delay and diversion with energy and purpose in the halls of our capital.

What we needed now more than ever is a politics that binds us togethera politics that looks to the futurea politics that asks not what is in it for mebut always what is in it for us.

We must embrace a progressive vision of government once more — a vision that upholds the values of individuality and community; of entrepreneurship and opportunity; of responsibility and fairness. No one any longer believes in government as a heavy hand that can cure all our illsbut rather we see it as a lean and responsive force that can make possible the pursuit of prosperity and opportunity for all — by softening life’s blowsleveling its playing field and making possible the pursuit of happiness that is our God-given right.

It is both tempting and understandable for each of us to focus on the problems and concerns within our own neighborhoodsour own citiesour own regions and our own businesses. But for any one of us to succeedwe must succeed as One New York.

A state that is not urban or ruralupstate or downstateRepublican or Democraticbut first and foremost New Yorkers — striving togetherreaching togetherworking together toward our common dream.

And sotogetherwe must strive to build One New York through a politics that operates on the principle that we rise or fall as one people and one state.

We will succeed not because we point fingers or refuse to budgebut because we compromise enough to find principled consensusand because we listen enough to find wise solutions.

Not everyone will agree with this vision and some will not support these solutions. Indeedwe will make mistakes. But progress we will have — measured by our core values.

Our purpose is not reform merely for the sake of reformbut to restore fairness and create opportunity and redefine the very fabric of our community.

Some may feel anxiety over changes that seek to make businesses more competitivebut all will benefit from an Innovation Economy that attracts young people and new businesses in every part of New York.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Some may express skepticism over a school system that demands more accountability from studentsteachers and parentsbut all will benefit from an education that rewards excellence and gives every child the best possible chance in life.

Some may feel threatened by health care reformsbut all will benefit from a system that finally puts patients first at a cost that all families can afford.

Some public officials may not want to face stricter ethics rules and more competitive electionsbut all citizens will win when we finally get a government that puts the people’s interestsopenness and integrity first.

With most of these reformsthere will be those who say we can’twe shouldn’t and we won’t.

They will peddle the politics of cynicism that we must now make the politics of yesterday. Because if we band together and succeed in our effortsour future will mean a New York that values the dignity of each person — and once more offers opportunity for all.

Every policyevery action every decision we make in this administration will further two overarching objectives: we must transform our government so that it is as ethical and wise as all of New Yorkand we must rebuild our economy so that it is ready to compete on the global stage in the next century. The simplicity of articulating these principles belies the complexity of the task. But victory will be oursas it must be.

And so on this day of unbridled hope and possibilityI ask you to think not only of the challenges and aspirations that you hold in your own heartsbut of those that are held in the collective heart of New York.

This One New York includes Chris Kelder and his familywho have farmed their land in Ulster County for more than two centuriespassing their dreams on to each successive generation.

It includes today’s immigrants whose lips speak the languages of SpanishChineseKoreanFrench and an infinite array of dialects from all over the world.

Today’s immigrants enrich our state with their vitality and their visionin the same way as the immigrants of the last century. All these different tongues translate into the incomparable work ethic of New York.

And it includes the brave immigrants who came through Ellis Island over the last century in search of a better lifeone of whose grandsons stands here in front of you today the embodiment of their dreams.

Each of us comes from a different place and from a different background. Each has faced their own tests and trials along life’s journey.

But throughout the history of New Yorkwhat has always united us as a people is the recognition that we are all on this journey togetherand if we’re willing to catch each other during our stumbles and look out for one another during the tough timeswe have it in our power to remove any obstacles in our path and walk toward that brighter day.

No matter how great the challenge — no matter how impossible the odds — our destiny will never be a path to followbut always a trail to blaze.

And so on this new day of a new yearI ask not just for your supportbut also for your cooperationyour patience and your participation in making our dream real once again.

As New York’s former Governor Theodore Roosevelt once remarkedthere can be no great progress without first entering the arena.

My fellow New Yorkers: join me in that arena.

Lend your sweatyour toil and your passion to the effort of building One New York of which we can all be proud.

My fellow New Yorkers. Our moment is here.

Day One is now.

Togetherlet’s build that One New York. Let’s walk toward that better day.

 4721,  1991, a, The Essex County Prosecutor's office today began investigating a melee that erupted as police officers tried to break up a teen-agers' holiday party at a home here early Sunday.

The disturbance led to 10 arrestsincluding that of Amiri Barakathe poet and playwrightand a heavy police response that startled residents of the normally quiet neighborhood at the northern end of Montclair Avenue.

Officials said all phases of the incident would be reviewed.

"We're trying to determine exactly what happened," said Raymond Weissa spokesman for Prosecutor Herbert H. Tate. "We're reviewing reports and questioning as many witnesses as we can find." Complaints of Noise

Two police officers and one partygoeridentified as Mr. Baraka's 18-year-old sonAmiri Jr.suffered minor injuries as the officersresponding to complaints about excessive noisewent to the home and tried to disperse the youthsofficials said. The police estimated that more than 100 people were at the party.
 329,  2017, a, The ministry runs the program. But the law that set it up requires participants to join and help finance a nonprofitAdvantageBCestablished in 1986 to promote British Columbia as a business destination. AdvantageBC advises its members on how to benefit from the tax breaks. The involvement of this group has also become a target for critics.

“There is no reason for this organization to be outside of government,” said Duff Conachera founder of Democracy Watcha Canadian civic organization“except to escape the ethicstransparency and accountability requirements government institutions have to face.”

Colin Hansena former provincial finance minister who helped expand the program’s tax incentives in 2010is president and chief executive of AdvantageBC. He defended the group’s involvement in the tax-break program. “On all issueswe are fully accountable to our memberswhich is where that accountability should be,” he said in an email.

As finance ministerMr. Hansen repeatedly declared that expanding the program would help attract companies doing international business and “create those jobs in British Columbia.”

In a recent interviewthoughhe said that its goal was really to enlarge the local financial services sector. “The program was not actually set up to be a job creator,” he said.

Mr. Hansen said most of the companies listed as “core members” on the group’s website were registered in the program. But he also said that some companies joined the group before seeking the benefits. He declined to provide a complete list of businesses. “Some companies are a little more sensitive about being included,” he said.

It is unclear which businesses listed on AdvantageBC’s website are in the program and receiving tax breaks. But a company must be a core member to get the refunds.

Michael Kavanagh of Ulster Countythe candidate for lieutenant governorwho will be running against a Democratic upstater whose selection also was announced last weekRepresentative Stanley N. Lundine of Jamestown.

There would have been a third Westchester resident on the ticket if Jeanine F. Pirroan assistant district attorney therehad not dropped out of the race after two daysas suddenly as she dropped in. Mr. O'Rourke raised questions about the legal and business connections of her husbandAlbert Pirroa lawyerand the couple decided Mr. Pirro's associates might object to the firm's disclosing its activities.

Even the party chairmanshiponce an upstate prerogativeis held by a downstaterAnthony J. Colavitawho is also the Westchester County chairman and who appointed a Westchester colleagueMargaret Soterto head the state party's platform committee.

The obvious imbalance was in part a result of the limited field of candidates willing to wage what even Republican Party leaders admitted was an uphill fight. ''The numbers frighten them off,'' said Mr. Farley.

But the shift of power has taken place gradually. Mr. Colavitawho has tried to fill the leadership vacuum in the State Republican Party that was left by Mr. Rockefeller and his longtime Lieutenant GovernorMalcolm Wilsonsays there has been an ''evolution'' to which several factors have contributed.

 3684,  1998, a, Mr. Fleischer and others credit the Brazilian President with acting quickly to contain the effects of the Asian crisis. [Wednesday's auction of Telebraswhich brought the Government $19 billion for its controlling stake in the national telecommunications systemshowed that investors remain bullish on the country's medium- and long-term prospects.]

IndeedBrazil receives the most direct foreign investment of any emerging market.

This all has created a certain euphoria about Brazil's prospectsbut analysts stress that the nation's economic health has suffered with the President's failure to follow through. In part because of the sharp increase in interest ratesthe budget deficit climbed to 6.7 percent of the gross domestic productwith the deficit for April nearly 80 percent higher than that for April 1997.

''A lot of the measures were 'for the English to see,' '' said Alexandre Barrosan economic consultantusing an expression dating back to the 1800'swhen Brazildeeply in debt to Englanddistracted its creditors by pledging to turn over customs revenuewhich had been falsely inflated.

Despite the pledges to outsidersMr. Barros saidthe Government has increased rather than cut spending since November. ''The Government did a lotbut the lot that it did was not enoughespecially with the deficit,'' he said.

In a recent interview in BrasiliaFinance Minister Pedro Malan acknowledged that the austerity measures President Cardoso promoted last fall were ''absolutely essential'' to shoring up Brazil's standing at the time. Though they were not all carried outhe said''we showed that we were firmly committed to continuing to move forward with the real.''

With the country's foreign-exchange reserves at nearly $71 billionafter falling to $52 billion when the Government was forced to defend the currency last fallMr. Malan argued that Brazil was now ''in a better position,'' and he called a devaluation ''out of the question.'' The realwhich trades within an exchange-rate bandis selling at 1.163 to the dollardown from 1.10 last November.

The economic and financial restructuring effort known here as the Real Plan began four years ago. It proceeded from his time as Finance Minister in the previous administrationreducing inflation to less than 5 percent this year from quadruple digits at its worst stage. And it has helped lift millions of Brazilians out of povertyin part by broadening access to credit. Before the effects of the Asian crisis spreadthe sales of carsappliances and other consumer goods had mushroomed in this country.
 4032,  1996, a, Six years agoEric and Virginia Holst exchanged their wedding vows standing side by side at the altar of St. John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church here on Main Street and Ocean Avenue. Todaytheir coffins rested side by side before the same altar.

Dr. and Mrs. Holst had boarded Trans World Airlines Flight 800 planning to celebrate their sixth anniversary in Paris. The crash brought them home.

Until Flight 800 fell from the skymost of the world had never heard of the Long Island inlet towns called the Moriches. But the Holsts had lived right nearbyin Manorvilleand Dr. Holsta dentistpracticed at Moriches Dental Associates on Main Street.

Hundreds of people crowded the oatmeal-colored church with a green-tiled roof for the funeral this morning as the towns that have played host to a world of grief paused to mourn two of their own.
 2530,  2004, a, This is unfortunate because the teen years are a time when sports participation can have its greatest benefits. Multiple studies show that children who participate in sports are less likely to smokeconsume illegal drugs and alcoholmiss classesdrop out of school and become pregnant. In additionfor those involved in sportsself-esteem tends to rise and the ability to solve problemshandle adversity and be creative improves.

''I think the biggest problem is that kids don't make the high school teamor the junior high school teamand drop out,'' said Richard Lapchickfounder of the Center for the Study of Sport in Society at Northeastern University. ''Kids think that if they don't make the team that their career is overtherefore they should stop competing or playing or doing anything that makes them physically fit.''

The common perception is that the United States is a sports-crazed country that believes strongly in the value of sports for our youth. But when you peel back the layers of the onionyou see that what we really value is elite sports programs. From the professional level to traveling club teams for 8-year-oldsour focus as a society is on elite athletes. Resources start being directed toward programs for elite athletes when children are young.

''There's a disparity in sportsthe fact that there is so much at the top and not enough at the bottom,'' said Tom McMillena former congressman and N.B.A. player. ''If you look at Americawe have very few resources at the bottom for our kids. We certainly have plenty of resources at the top. We can build megastadiumspay megasalaries for athletesbut we're not doing enough at the bottom.''

Drew A. Hylandauthor of ''Philosophy of Sport'' (Paragon House1990)sees part of the solution overseas. ''I think a wonderful thing would be for the United States to develop a more active sports club system of the sort that you see in Europewhere folks keep on playing actively in leagues and so forth on into adulthood,'' Hyland said.

In most European countriesthere is a sports club for everyone. If you are a premier athletethere is a team for you. If you are an athletically challenged kidbut still love the gamethere is also a team for you. Clubs in Europe will often have an ''A'' teama ''B'' teama ''C'' teamon downso everyone is accommodated.

To change the disturbing decline in the physical fitness in Americawe need to do a better job spreading the word about the poor state of our children's physical fitness and the long-term impact that will have on their health. We must have more physical education in our schoolsnot less. And we need more recreationintramural and club programs that provide organized sports opportunities for all ages and levels of ability.

As parentsadministratorslegislatorsteachers and coachesit is up to us to find ways to get more children involved and keep them participating longer. Will it be physical fitness or physical ''fatness'' for our youth?
 5564,  1986, a, Protests over Moscow's delay in announcing the nuclear accident were particularly sharp from Sweden and Denmark.

Prime Minister Poul Schluter of Denmark said''It is totally unacceptable and unsatisfactory that we can come to experience such a greattragic nuclear power accident without the governments in the neighboring states being informed about what happened.''

Sweden's Energy MinisterBirgitta Dahlsaid her Government was preparing ''a list of demands with regard to the Soviet Union,'' noting that these would include steps to improve safety at nuclear plants. Previous requests by Sweden for the Soviet Union to improve plant safety have been ignoredGovernment officials say.

Apparently trying to limit the diplomatic damagethe Soviet Ambassador met with Swedish officials today and pledged to provide more complete information about any further troubles at the Chernobyl plant.

 4169,  1995, a, Serge Tchurukchairman of the French oil company Total S.A.told shareholders at the company's annual meeting today that he had decided to accept an offer to lead Alcatel Alsthom S.A.the giant French conglomerate.

Alcatelwhich has interests in telecommunicationstransportation and energysaid Tuesday evening that it had offered the positions of chairman and chief executive to Mr. Tchurukwho is 57. He will take the positions on June 22replacing Pierre Suardwho was forced to step down in April because of fraud and corruption charges against him.

Alcatel investors reacted enthusiastically to the news. Alcatel's shares rose 3.2 percent in Paris todayto 451.80 French francs from 438 on Tuesday. The level on Tuesday itself represented a 3.8 percent gain from Monday as speculation grew that Mr. Tchuruk would take the job.

Alcatel had named Marc Vienotthe chairman of the bank Societe Generaleas interim chairman in April with a brief to find a successor to Mr. Suard. People close to Mr. Vienot said he had been impressed by Mr. Tchuruk's record at Totalwhere he was chairman for five years.

Such attention can be dauntingeven for a veteran like Mr. Mackie. Because he is shy by naturecontent to stand one step outside the spotlight in which his leading ladies blazeit has been hard for him to make peace with seeing a version of himself on a Broadway stage.

“All I said wasplease don’t play me like a nellyofficious old queen who comes in with sketches under his arm,” he said. The designer’s dancing doppelgänger doesn’t do that.

“It’s important to me that I honor this person that I admire so much,” Mr. Berresse said. A navy blazer man in real lifeMr. Mackie did let himself have some fun with his onstage counterpart’s clothes. The fictional Bobat one pointenters wearing a very groovy python jacket. “Bob said‘You knowI would never wear anything I’m making for you,’” Mr. Berresse said.

Regardlesswhen Mr. Mackie attends a performance at the Neil Simon these dayshe is often greeted by adoring fans. “I get to watch people mob him and want to get their pictures taken with him and get his autograph,” Mr. Suarez said. “To be a small part of him having a big moment makes me beyond happy.”

The toughest critic of “The Cher Show” — Cher — is also overjoyed with this aspect of it. “There is simply no one like Bob Mackie,” she wrote in her email. “I love him. Always have. Always will.”
 2208,  2006, a, "Many national studies on victims of domestic violence tell us that their abusers have threatened to killthreatened to harm or actually harmed their pets as a means of keeping the victim from leaving the relationship," Mr. Baldaccia Democratsaid. "With this new lawwe hope to help remove another tool for emotional and physical violence used by the abuser to exert power and control over their victims."

Maine is believed to be the first state with such a law. But the issue has captured attention around the country as police departmentsdomestic-violence programsanimal protection societies and state officials become increasingly aware of a link between domestic violence and animal abuse.

A new program in ColumbusOhiotakes animals of victims of domestic violence and places them in a women's prisonwhere the inmates care for them. In Nashvillethe city gives such pets a safe haven for up to 30 days. And in St. Louisthe Domestic Violence Pet Assistance Program finds foster homes for the animals.

"There are some batterers who are prone to using coercion and terrorizing tactics who very well know how strongly attached their partner is to the animals in her life," said Frank A. Ascionea psychologist at Utah State University. "It's the dynamic of preying on the love and affection that women often have for the animals in their liveswho may be their only source of solacetheir only source of unconditional love."

In the late 1990'sDr. Ascione and colleagues interviewed 101 women in shelters for battered women and 120 women who were not victims of domestic violence.

They found that 54 percent of the battered women said their abusers had harmed or killed their animalscompared with 5 percent of women in the other group. Thirty-four percent of the women whose pets had been both threatened and harmed delayed going to the shelters out of concern for their pets.

In 2002Dr. Ascione saidhe interviewed 42 men in prison who had had violent relationships with women and found that half of them said they had hurt or killed pets.

"Police and prosecutors are well aware of the very close link between threats to pets and threats to family members," Maine's public safety commissionerMichael P. Cantarasaid. He cited a 2002 case in which an abusive husband had beaten the family's cats to deathburied them in the backyard and threatened a similar fate for his wife and children.

"To our horror," Mr. Cantara said"that yard was filled with dead Maine pets."

Karen Dayspresident of the Columbus Coalition Against Family Violence in Ohiosaid of her work at the Columbus city prosecutor's office: "I had a victim who was in my officeand the prosecutor agreed to issue a warrant for the arrest of her partner. But she was just adamant that she be able to go home first and get her dog. When I asked whyshe said'When I left him beforehe started mailing me pieces of my cat to tell me if you don't come back this is what I'm going to continue to do.' "

Ms. Days and others said that battered women without children might be the most attached to their pets. But in homes with childrenthere are other concernsDr. Ascione said.

He said that seeing animals abused made "some kids likely to act out what they may have witnessed," while others "get even more strongly attached to their pets," which can be dangerous if the "children start trying to intervene to protect the animals."

Jill Morristhe public policy director at the National Coalition against Domestic Violencesaid that she had not heard of another law like Maine's but that some judges had begun to include animals in protective orders.

Ms. Days said her organization would be lobbying the Ohio Legislature to make penalties for domestic violence stiffer if animal abuse was involved.

Wayne Pacellepresident of the Humane Society of the United Statessaid his organization conducted workshops for police departmentsprosecutors and social workers on the problem.

"Oftentimes these situations go on for a long periodsay months or years," Mr. Pacelle said. "We really try to spread the word about this."
 5084,  1989, a, To the Editor:

It is difficult to understand why the basis of our protests against United States Surgical Corporation is consistently misreported (news storyMarch 3). The company operates on live dogs in hundreds of sales demonstrations to promote use of its surgical staplers to doctors. Board-certified surgeons are trained in all wound-closure methods. United States Surgical is not a medical school; it is a commercial enterprise that kills dogs to make sales. That has nothing to do with surgical training. It has everything to do with animal abuse.

More to the point would be a report on our efforts and legal actions to have the company's Connecticut lab license revoked so that this vivisection for profit can be stopped. The case is now on appealand the truth may soon be recognized as expert opinion is brought to bear.

Yesthere are larger issues involvedbut none larger than the cutting up and killing of dogs for corporate profits. PRISCILLA FERAL PresidentFriends of Animals NorwalkConn.March 71989
 2399,  2005, a, GRAD SCHOOLING: The funniest graduation speech delivered thus far in the 00's was probably Tony Kushner'sgiven last spring at Columbia. Kushner had discovered he was not the university's first choice to speak (Jon Stewart was)and he stepped up to the podium and said: "I think I should begin by acknowledging your disappointment that I am not Jon Stewart. Think how I feel. Your disappointment that I am not Jon Stewart will last one morning; I am disappointed at not being Jon Stewart every morning of my life." Funny graduation speechesalasare rarely turned into bite-size books to be marketed around the time of later graduations. Earnest speeches frequently are. Anna Quindlen's new book"Being Perfect," is based on the graduation speech she gave at Mount Holyoke in 1999. And Maria Shriver's new book"And One More Thing Before You Go . . . ," is expanded from a luncheon speech she delivered not long ago to graduating high school girls and their mothers. (Shriver's bold advice includes "Learn from your mistakes" and "You'll need a lot of courage.") Shriver's book hits the hardcover miscellaneous list this week at No. 3pushed along by an appearance on "Oprah," during which Oprah introduced her by intoning the 11 words every woman with a new book dreams of hearing from her: "My old girlfriendoldoldoldwe go so far back."

FREAK FACTOR: "If Indiana Jones were an economisthe'd be Steven Levitt." That's a Wall Street Journal reviewer's take on Levitta 37-year-old University of Chicago economist whose new book"Freakonomics," written with Stephen J. Dubnerenters the hardcover nonfiction list at No. 5. But "Freakonomics" is so slyfinicky and micro-observant that the Indiana Jones comparison feels a little off -- Levitt is more like the Nicholson Baker of economists. His specialty is asking some unusual questions: "How is the Ku Klux Klan like a group of real estate agents?"; "Why do drug dealers still live with their moms?" The answers tend to be provocative. The most eye-popping assertion in "Freakonomics" may be that the drop in crime during the 1990's had little to do with a strong economy or new police strategies. The real reasonLevitt sayswas Roe v. Wade. "An entire generation came of age minus the children whose mothers had not wanted to bring a child into the world," he and Dubner write. "Legalized abortion led to less unwantedness; unwantedness leads to high crime." On NPRScott Simon asked Levitt if it was true he'd been offered a job in the Bush administration. YesLevitt saidthen added"I told them you better go back and look at the study I did on the link between abortion and crime and if you're still interestedcall me backand I never did get that return phone call."

Largely through the efforts of his friend Paul Gasiorhe acquired the marina in the late 1970s. Brown's Point Marina is one of the most active dealers for Suzuki Marine in the country. Mr. Moore enjoyed nothing more than his twicea-year boat trips to his home in Florida with Gasiorfamily and other friends. He enjoyed boating so much that he obtained his 200ton boating license through the Coast Guardupgraded from 100ton. At the time of the World Trade Center disasterMr. Moore was staying at his New York apartment near the Trade Centerconfined to bed because of his illness. His marina friendsespecially Gasiorand Old Bridge Police Chief Jerry Polumbo and George Jensenrescued him from the building after the Twin Towers' collapse.

 2493,  2005, a, Readers respond to David Brooks’s Dec. 1 column“The Age of Skepticism“:

Maureen ScottKansas CityMo.: I feel obligated to respond to the following portion of your latest column in the context of the Great Depression: “As the Harvard economist Benjamin Friedman has observedAmericans begin social reforms when they are feeling confidentnot when they are weary and insecure.”

At the depths of the Depressionsocial reforms took priority . . . To say that the nation was feeling confident at that time would be a misnomer. It took the overwhelming will of a strong leaderRooseveltto keep on message about the positive nature of our nation to set reforms in motion.

What we lack right nowas a nationis a strong leader who we can rally around. I see no such persons in our political parties that are ready to step up to this challengeto overcome partisan politics and do what is necessary for the future of this nation. THAT is what makes me weary and insecure. We need another Lincoln to overcome the divides and remind us what this country was founded upon.

Ted BrownSan Francisco: Your essay today provides an interesting bookend to your piece on the unappreciated heroism of our troops.

The common theme in bothit seems to meis one I’ve seen in a lot of political writing in the past 10 years. In different waysfor instanceboth E.J. Dionne and Christopher Lasch have discussed the retreat of Americans from responsibilities outside of their own property linestheir own private circle of concerns. Is it any wonder that the exurbs are a popularattractive residence destinations for millions of Americans? A place where the evils of the worldlike poverty and disease and warare kept at bayor at least vicariously experienced through violent video gamesa place where personal dreams and ambitions are fostered without much care for civic or patriotic sentiments and habits.

What should our government do given these circumstances? I thinkin partthis willed personal isolation explains the appeal of current conservative politics to so many Americans — the idea that governance is somehow a problemnot an essential part and positive good of any civilization. In a subtle wayit’s an easy step to see civic obligations and patriotic sacrifice as part of the evils of government. After alldon’t such sensibilities force us to connect with our political institutions? And this is why this administration has failed in its leadership it has neither asked nor inspired the majority of Americans to commit to the war on terrorismor in day-to-day termsto drive an economy car instead of an S.U.V. because we need to save our resources to win this war.

Michael KoplowWoburnMass.: It is not as bad as you suggest. It is a question of leadership in this countryand as you well know but seldom stateour leaders in Washington under this administration are woefully unqualified to manage the country’s affairs.

Why not state the obvious reason for such skepticism in the U.S. the incompetence of the current administration. If we get capable leadershipthe public’s skepticism will evaporate.

Paul CorningSan Francisco: One of the most significant social changes in my lifetime happened with the transition to Ronald Reagan’s presidency.

If I remember correctlyit happened not at a time when Americans were feeling confidentbut at a point of near despair over our economy and our power in the world. Reagan’s reforms pale in comparison to FDR’swhich were larger and were attempted during far more difficult times.

It is pain and fear that encourages us to change. Unfortunatelywe probably have a lot of both ahead before we get serious about change.

Steven CampbellOaklandCalif.: While I agree with Mr. Brooks that we are living in a time when the American people view their government with equal measures of skepticism and cynicismI am once again disturbed by his unwillingness to put much of the blame where it belongs — the Republican Party.

While I agree that the Democratic Party is far from blamelessthe Republicans have practically made cynicism their political strategy. After 9/11President Bush had the opportunity to put his money where his mouth was and actually be the uniter he claimed to be. Unfortunatelyhe instead squandered national unity and resolve on partisan political goalsputting party before country.

When politicians clear cut trees in the name of healthy forestsor weaken air pollution controls and call it clear skiesis it any wonder that the American people are cynical?

Tim PotterOceanside Calif.: You are right on the money when you say that the American public is skeptical about the U.S. government’s abilityespecially this Bush administrationto ‘solve the deep problems that are rooted in history and culture.’

This skepticism was cured on Vietnam and Watergate. I disagree that it leads or will lead to passivity. If a person is let down enough by a situationor otherslong enoughthey figure out eventually that they can not rely on that situation or personsand that they need to take matters into their own hands. The most successful people throughout history have not waited for anyone to give them permission to realize their dreams.

I submit that what is happening now is a new awakeningwhere people are seeing behind the veil of illusion that government as it is now solves our problemsinitiates change or meaningfully effect our lives.

Albert SayersPound Ridge N.Y.: There is one component you missed in your essay about cynicism and that is honesty. I have heard you over and over again say that how we got into the war is over and how we are going to go forward is what matters and so let’s go.

YesWe need to move forward. But people understand when they have been deceived and that is how they feel now. They know there were no W.M.D.’sespecially nuclear ones that scared us all to death. They know the occupation was bungled but they hear the administration saying the insurgents are in their last throes. If the administration did not lie about W.M.D. and it was the intelligence that was badthey want to know why the president gave the head of the C.I.A. a medal! . . . It just does not add up.

On Sunday Sen. Warner said the president should have a fireside chat like Roosevelt did. What made those chats work is that when he told you what was going to happen and why the facts unfolded to support his statements. That builds trust. Misleading the people leads to cynicism.

Lastlywhen you treat people who disagree with you . . . with contempt you are in fact saying you have contempt for the system that gives them their voice in the first place. . .
 5186,  1989, a, Turner Broadcasting System Inc. signed a four-year$275 million contract with the National Basketball Association yesterday that nearly tripled the annual license fee that cable television now pays to professional basketball.

In early Novemberthe N.B.A. also tripled the value of its broadcast-television arrangement when NBC agreed to pay $600 million for four years for television rights to league games.

When the promotional services won from NBC are includedthe total N.B.A. television arrangement for the 1990-93 seasons is worth nearly $925 million. Under the league's agreement with the players53 percent of the income from the sale of television rights must go to the playersand the new deals will probably push the average salary past $1 million from the current $750,000.

Under the new agreementTNT will show 50 regular-season games and at least 25 playoff games. The regular-season games are usually shown on Tuesday and Friday evenings.

 5277,  1988, a, In Robbins v. Californiahe said: ''It is often forgotten that nothing in the Fourth Amendment itself requires that searches be conducted pursuant to warrants.'' The Chief Justice seems to have sanitized the language of the Fourth Amendment by asking us to forget that the ''right of persons to be secure in their personshousespapers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizuresshall not be violated.''

In Mapp v. Ohiodecided in 1961the defendant was convicted of possession of obscene literature. Her conviction was based primarily on the introduction in evidence of supposedly lewd and lascivious books seized during an unlawful search of her home. At the trialno search warrant was produced by the prosecution. The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of convictionholding that the rule excluding evidence unlawfully seized was ''an essential part of both the Fourth and 14th Amendments.'' This is the exclusionary rule criticized by Justice Rehnquist.

Nowwe are told''what a person knowingly exposes to the publiceven in his home or officeis not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection'' (quoting Smith v. Maryland1979)even the intimate details and habits of the life he or she leads in the home.

It is no wonder that Justice William J. Brennan Jr. wrote in dissent ''that members of our society will be shocked to learn that the Courtthe ultimate guarantor of libertydeems unreasonable our expectation that the aspects of our private lives that are concealed safely in a trash bag will not become public.'' He also stated''Scrutiny of another's trash is contrary to commonly accepted notions of civilized behavior.''

FinallyJustice Whitewriting for the majority failed to note that an Orange County ordinance required the respondents to ''remove from their premises at least once a week all solid waste createdproduced or accumulated in or about his dwelling house.'' Accordinglyrespondent Greenwood cannot be said to have voluntarily placed his trash in an area accessible to the public. He had no choice and was merely acting in compliance with a county ordinance. He was held to have surrendered his subjective expectation of privacybut not in a manner society accepts as objectively reasonable. Society would not accept the proposition that a person merely by placing a letter or book in a mailbox for pickup by the postal carrier has surrendered reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of either. In 1789James Madison wrote in ''Annals of Congress'' (Volume Onepage 439) that ''independent tribunals of justice will be naturally led to resist every encroachment upon rights expressly stipulated for in the Constitution by the declaration of rights'' (Amendments One through 10ratified in 1791). Nowalmost 200 years laterthe Supreme Court of the United States has indeed encroached upon rights expressly granted in the Fourth Amendment by trashing our privacy. WILLIAM M.

 2317,  2006, a, Is it just meor are the freebies starting to blossom once again on the Web? Feels like it’s 1999 all over again.

I’ve got yet another great free one for you todayand it’s a doozie. I read about it in PC Worldand couldn’t believe it: a service that purports to speed up your broadband Internet connection. It’s called Open DNS.

Works greatat least for me. Once I plugged the Open DNS addresses into my routerthe wait time for a complex Web page went from 3-4 seconds down to 1-2on both my Macs and PC’s.

In shortOpen DNS works by caching a key phase of Web-page requests (namelyDNS requests) from its thousands of usersso that the site you want is blasted to you in a fraction of a second.

There’s no feeno software to installyou don’t give them any information about yourselfand you don’t have to do anything different once you change your router’s DNS server addresses. (Sounds technicalbut the site walks you through the instructions.) As a bonusOpen DNS intercepts phishing scams and corrects Web-address typossparing you those headaches. (The typo-correcting feature is where Open DNS plans to make its money; read the site to learn the whole plan.)

My wife and I are totally loving the new speed. Don’t tell Open DNSbut we even would have paid for it.

 4613,  1992, a, John Donovana novelistplaywright and past president of the Children's Book Councildied on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 63 years old.

He died of cancersaid Paula Quintthe president of the council.

 2774,  2003, a, The flat beside the cay was an ideal habitat for permitwhich we could see feeding during the mornings we stayed theretheir noses searching for crabs in the sandtheir tails visible above water -- like thin black sails. The tailing permit has been the catalyst of more than one fly-fishing obsession. Certain maniac fly fishers will cast to thousands of elusive permit before hooking one.

The first afternoonwe went out to other cays and their adjacent flatswhere I had my first shot at a school of tailing permit. Much as I would like to think of myself as an accomplished anglerthe sight of these fish with their tails in the air befuddled me. On the first castI hooked my thigh and drew blood (it was the wind's faultof course)then the guide told me to get into the shallow water and stalk the fish by wadingat which point I wrapped the line around my feet and fell overboard with a big splash.

The greatest pleasure of any fishing tripespecially when the fish get the better of youis when you meet wonderful people. I learned a great deal about the area from my guide Eloya native of Monkey River village on the mouth of the Monkey River. He gave me a brief history of the Belize fishery.

''When I started fishingmanall we had was handlines,'' Eloy said. ''We called it cotton line. As a kid we caught snook to 30 pounds all the timeand one day when the snappers were spawning my friend and I caught 140averaging 10 pounds. I didn't know what a fishing rod was. The first fly-fishing rod I saw was in 1980. I saw this man in a boat up the Monkey River with his line up in the air. I thoughtI want to do that thing with the line up in the air.

''We made flies with egret feathers. Manthose things were killer for snook. The Guatemalans introduced gill nets in southern Belize in 1970. They started using gill nets in Monkey River and Punta Negra. Ten years laterthey had at least half the fish dead.''

Eloy grew up hunting in the forest for jaguarpeccaryjaguarundi and whatever else he could shoot. He hunted mostly at night and on several occasions was nearly bitten by fatal fer-de-lance snakes. He fished in the sea for snapperlobster and conch. He and his friends kept everything they could get and killed it to eat or sell.

NowEloy is one of the greatest proponents of preserving the native fish and fauna and works closely with the Nature Conservancy to educate people to support the wildlife and become ecotourist guides.

''You got to protect the resourceman,'' he said. ''It's all we got.''

In the eveningwe drank fresh coconut water with gin. Thenwhen it was dark and the wind was downEloy began his stories of the 70-minute nightmare of Hurricane Iris in October 2001. It is worth the trip merely to hear his story.
 5390,  1987, a, Another orchestral choice must be made a week from Saturdaybecause both the Westchester and White Plains Symphonies are in musical action on March 14. At 8 o'clock that eveningthe music directorMartin Canellakisleads the Westchester Symphony in an all-Mozart evening presenting Lee Luvisi (the noted pianist of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center) in the so-called Elvira Madigan Concerto in CK.467and showcases the artistry of four principal players in the Westchester Orchestra - Margaret HelferMatthew GoodmanSusan Panny and Gines Cano - via the Symphonie Concertante for OboeClarinetHorn and Bassoon. Rounding things out is Mozart's ''Prague'' Symphony No. 38 (238-4544).

Half an hour laterthe music adviserKenneth Schermerhornwill also be conducting Mozartspecifically the Sinfonia Concertante for ViolinViola and Orchestraat the White Plains Intermediate School. Because this is a continuation of the ''New York Philharmonic Night at the White Plains Symphony,'' which was begun so successfully last seasonthe two youngest members of the Philharmonic - Kerry McDermott and Rebecca Young - have been invited to share the solo spotlight. After intermissionhowevercomes the expansive Mahler Fourth Symphony with another fine young American artistElizabeth Hendersonjoining the orchestra for the exquisite soprano song that dominates the last movement (725-1880 or 472-2361).

Completing the orchestral circle on March 15 is the Philharmonia Virtuosireturning to the State University with what its brochure calls ''an All-Baroque Spectacular.'' Departing from his usual pattern of spicing the warhorses with concert raritiesthe music directorRichard Kapphas this time elected to stay with three of the most popular works by the three most famous Baroque composers. On the list: Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons'' with the Philharmonia Virtuosi's concertmasterPaul Peabodyas soloist; the Third Suite for Orchestra by Bachand excerpts from Handel's ''Royal Fireworks Music'' (693-5595).

Among concerts of note on the solo and chamber frontswe find the superb young pianist Bennett Lerner playing works of CoplandThomsonRavelChopin and several other composers at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkersa recital beginning today at 3 P.M. (963-4550); or head over to the Community Unitarian Church in White Plains at the same hourwhere the Casa Verde Trio continues its season in residenceplaying the great Tchaikovsky A minor Trio andwith the superb young soprano Dawn Upshaw as guest artista selection of Beethoven's Irish and Scottish folk songs (946-1660). Also on today's schedule is an 8 P.M. concert at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers presenting the solo and chamber music of the composer Andre Singerwho taught at the college for more than 30 years until his retirement in 1977 (337-0700).

Three superb artistsall of whom have appeared in the county with other partnershave joined to form a new group called ''Contrasts.'' If you know the celebrated piece of that title by Bartokyou will have guessed correctly that the complement of the ensemble is clarinetviolin and pianoand indeed the Bartok is prominently featured on the program that Esther LamneckYuval Waldman and Thomas Hrynkiw have designed for their collective county debut. The 8:30 P.M. Saturday recitalin the Sleepy Hollow Series at Tarrytown's Washington Irving Schoolalso lists trios of BruchMozart and Milhaud (332-0382).
 2891,  2002, a, Mr. Erekatthe Palestinian negotiatorsaid of Mr. Sharon's comment''A prime minister in his country who would say something about killing people or liquidating people -- it's a gangster mentality.''

Mr. Arafat and other Palestinians believe that Israel repeatedly tried to kill him in Lebanon with bombing raids thatlike other efforts to assassinate him over the yearsbarely missed their target.

As the conflict has dragged onthe Bush administration has increasingly backed Mr. Sharon. Todaywith obvious reluctanceit gently rebuked him for publicly regretting that Israel missed a chance to kill the Palestinian leader. Richard A. Boucherthe State Department spokesmansaid he did not have ''any particular comment.'' But he added that both sides should ''avoid remarks that inflame the situation.''

''Remarks like these can be unhelpful,'' he said.

The Bush administration has repeatedly said that Mr. Arafat has done too little to stop Palestinian violence. Last weekPresident Bush suggested that Mr. Arafat was ''enhancing terror,'' citing Israel's capture on Jan. 4 of a ship smuggling munitions under Palestinian command. Mr. Arafat has said he had nothing to do with the ship.

Though he wished Mr. Arafat deadMr. Sharon insisted in the interview that he had not given up on the Palestinian leader as a potential partner for peace. ''If Arafat takes all the steps we are demanding that he takeas far as I am concernedhe will again be a partner to negotiations,'' Mr. Sharon said. Israel insists that Mr. Arafat crush all Palestinian militant groups and take other steps to prevent violence before any substantive negotiations resume.

Mr. Sharon reiterated his support for the establishment of a Palestinian statealbeit a limited one. ''Ultimatelyan independent Palestinian state will be establishedwhich will be demilitarized and will have only a police forceto keep public order,'' he told Maariv. ''In order to have true peaceI am willing to relinquish portions of Israel.''

Mr. Sharon has previously indicated that he would give up about 42 percent of the West Bankwhich Israel took by force in the 1967 war. Less than two years agoMr. Arafat rejected as insufficient an offer from Ehud Barakthen the Israeli prime ministerof more than twice that much territory.
 6208,  1975, a, The Board of Higher Education last knight backed away from action on its own proposal to cut $55 million from the City University's spring term budgetapparently after John E. Zuccottithe First Deputy Mayor‐designaterejected major portions of the plan.

The budget‐cutting actionalready Postponed once as the board bargained for a reprieve from a city mandate to cut the moneyincluded several measures that the Mayor's office considered to be “one‐shot” steps that failed to meet the requirements of the three‐year plan for the financial reorganization of the university system.

Alfred A. Giardinothe board chairmanopened and closed the brief special meeting with a statement noting that all members of the board had been “fully prepared to vote on this resolution on budget retrench. ment to cut $55 million this year.”

 2574,  2004, a, Trump Hotels and Casino Resortsthe centerpiece of Donald J. Trump's struggling casino empirereported a quarterly loss of nearly $49 million yesterdayfurther undermining the company's tenuous financial position and complicating its ability to meet hefty debt payments due at the end of this month and in the fall.

Trump Hotels has about $1.8 billion in debt that has drained the company of the cash it needs to maintain its properties and compete effectively in the Atlantic City gambling market. Over the last few monthsthe company and its bondholders have been considering options to deal with the debt burdenincluding a prepackaged bankruptcy or a recapitalization that would cede control of the company to a major investment bank.

Either option would result in a sharply decreased role at Trump Hotels for Mr. Trumpthe chief executivewho has been accused by analysts and bondholders of ineffective management and slipshod financial practices.

Trump Hotels said it lost $48.8 millionor $1.63 a sharein the quartercompared with a loss of $24 millionor $1.09 a sharein the period a year earlier. Trump Hotels has never been profitable since it became a public company in 1995. The company said yesterday's losses included a provision of $19.1 million related to the payment of state taxes in Indiana. The company's quarterly revenue was $276.2 milliondown from $278.8 million.

 1553,  2010, a, ST. PETERSBURGFla. — Looking more like Fat Elvis than the Big PumaLance Berkman had a rocky first two games with the Yankeeswhich he readily acknowledged. He went 1 for 8 over the weekend with a few shaky plays at first base Sunday that helped the Rays score all of their runs in a 3-0 victory.

“I told Andy that several times over the last day and a half I’ve been about to burst into tears,” said Berkmanreferring to Andy Pettitte. “Literallythe emotion is incredible. I haven’t experienced anything like that. There’s a sadness there. It’s just weird. I’m thrilled to be herethis is a great opportunityit’s not that.

“When you spend that much of your career with one organization and you think about all the people that you meet over there — little thingswhen we go on the roadI know what’s expected as far as getting your bag outyour bus times. HereI’m like‘What do I do?’ It can fluster you.”

Berkman and his wife have four daughterswhose school is around the corner from their home in Houston. Leaving them on road trips did not seem as bad because he knew he would always come back and sleep in his own bed. For supporthe has leaned on Pettitteone of his best friends.

As the Yankees were pondering trading for BerkmanPettitte said General Manager Brian Cashman did not ask for his opinion because “I knew you wouldn’t have anything bad to say about himso it really wasn’t fair.”

In his debut SaturdayBerkman went 0 for 4. He said he was tired and excited and “overamped.” He was able to relax a little more on Sundayand he said he was looking forward to playing his first game at home on Monday night against Toronto.

“I had a guy wearing me out at first base all day today,“ Berkman said. “I know that can happen theretoomaybe.”

Asked which team his heckler supportedBerkman laughed.

“I think it was a Rays fan,” Berkman said. “I’m hoping.”

 4792,  1991, a, The change in accounting rulesplus losses totaling $372 million in 1988 and 1989left Goldome at the end of 1990 with a negative capital position of $452.4 million. Although the company was insolvent under accounting rulesbanking regulators allowed it to stay in business while new management returned it to profitability and searched for fresh capital. Changing Approach

After Thomas A. Coopera former president of the BankAmerica Corporationbecame chairman two years agoGoldome cut non-interest expenses to $255 million in 1990 from $438 million in 1989and began to concentrate on collecting deposits and making loans to middle-income consumers in the Buffalo areawhere 35 percent of the households have an account with the bank.

As part of its effort to make a turnaroundGoldome sold 24 branches with $2.8 billion of deposits in the New York City area to the Manufactures Hanover Trust Company during late 1989 and earlier this year.

Because of the strong position of Goldome in the Buffalo areaand its return to profitability -- the company earned $37.5 million in 1990 -- Mr. Cooper said earlier this year that the company was "worth much more than is shown on its balance sheet." Search for Investors

But Mr. Cooper's efforts to assemble a group of investors were unsuccessfuland other potential buyersincluding GE Capitaldecided against investing in the company. Investment bankers said many other banks were interested in Goldomebut none could compete with Keycorp and First Empirewhich had the advantage of local branch networks that could be economically merged with Goldome's system.

Keycorp and First Empirewhich agreed to add $195 million and $40 million of capitalrespectivelyto their banking unitsface limited risk of loss because the F.D.I.C. agreed to take about $1.8 billion of loans and other assets from Goldome subsidiariesas well as $400 million of weak loans from Goldome's Buffalo savings bank.

In additionthe two companies may return for three years any Goldome loans that turn bad. To attract the two buyersthe F.D.I.C. agreed to pay $163 million to Keycorp and $40 million to First Empirea Keycorp official said.

Keycorp and First Empire previously collaborated in 1989 in the purchase of branches and deposits of the Empire of America Corporationanother Buffalo savings bank that ran into trouble during the 1980'swhen it expanded outside its local market.

 2395,  2005, a, Mr. Pyle said Vietnam wasfor many journalistsan indefinable experience that altered their lives. "Vietnam was a magnetic force -- you can't define it," Mr. Pyle said. "It wasn't just the best story of our careersit transcended that. We all moved on to other thingsbut we all have Vietnam in our systems forever. You never really get away from Vietnam. It's always there."

Authors as varied as Mr. Maugham and Mr. Greene have used similar words to describe a city that changes but doesn't reallya city thick with the scent of jasmine and spice and motor fuela city that seems mysterious even when it's not.

The narrow street adjacent to the Continental and Caravelle Hotels in downtown Ho Chi Minh City reflects some of the city's transformation. The French knew the street as Rue Catinata street whose cafes and shops served as the center of colonial life for decades. After the French left in 1954the South Vietnamese changed the street's name to Tu Door Freedom. The influx of American soldiers led to a flood of bars and prostitutes. After the warthe Vietnamese changed the street's name to Dong Khoior Uprising. In recent yearsthe street has mirrored the nation's economic confidencewith upscale shops and boutiques interspersed with more modest ones. The remnants of colonialism and the G.I.'s are gone.

For some of the foreign journalists hereone attempted meeting was a visit to the home of Pham Xuan An. Mr. An was one of the more celebrated Vietnamese journalists working in Saigon in the 1960's and 1970'sa reporter for Reuters before joining Time Magazineand especially popular with journalists for the larger newspapers and magazinesand visiting editors and columnists. Mr. An was elegantcandid and seemed highly informed about the inner workings of the South Vietnamese government. He was also an espionage agent for North Vietnam.

According to an English-language paperback book purchased here"Pham Xuan An: a General of the Secret Service," by Hoang Hao Van and Tan TuMr. An was actually a retired major general and a top intelligence officer in the Vietnam People's Army. The book said Mr. An was trusted by the Central Intelligence Agency and extremely close to the Saigon government run by Nguyen Van Thieu. But how Mr. An operated as a journalist and intelligence agent and what he accomplished as a spy remains a mystery.

By phoneMr. An said he had emphysema and took ill at the moment to chat. "I was born in 1927," he said. "I'm 78. I'm the same age as Fidel Castro. I'm two years older than Arafatbut he's gone now."

Western Union will buy back $335 million worth of junk bonds at 50 cents on the dollarthe company said. The buyback involves $329 million worth of 19 1/4 percent notes and $6 million of 16 percent notes from investors who accept the offer by Thursday. Western Union's debt will be $311 million after the buyback.

At least 127,000 people have been infected by dengue so far this year along an arc that stretches from eastern India through the Indonesian archipelagowith at least 990 deathsthe health authorities say. Warning of a dengue epidemicMalaysia recently joined Singapore in declaring emergency measures to combat a surge in cases that has killed at least 70 people. While those two countries are experiencing record infectionsthe worst-affected has been populous Indonesiawith more than 48,000 cases and more than 600 deaths.

"Dengue is now one of the most important tropical diseases," said Duane Gublerdirector of the Asia-Pacific Institute for Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases at the University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine. "While it doesn't kill that many peopleit has tremendous economic and social impact."

Dengue is from the same family of viruses that causes West NileJapanese encephalitis and yellow fever. There is no vaccine or treatmentand it is estimated to infect at least 50 million people a year. Those with acute cases suffer painful fever and debilitating lethargywith about 1 percent developing hemorrhagic fever or shocksometimes with gastrointestinal bleeding andin rare casesbrain hemorrhages.

 3656,  1998, a, They were trailing by 77-74 with six and a half minutes remainingsagging from the strain of Jordan's energy drainfrom front-line foulsfrom the Pacers' defense and from their own lack of reliable depth.

Even after Toni Kukoc's 14-point perimeter explosion in the third quarterthe Bulls looked like a defending champion on the ropeswith that glazed bail-us-out-Michael look. Jordanhaving entirely missed the rim on a couple of his most recent drivespersisted and drove into the lane. The long-armed Derrick McKey reached in as Jordan neared the basket and stripped Jordan of the ball. It rolled in the direction of Rik Smits. Jordanfalling backwardreached awkwardly around Smits. They both got their hands on the balland Jordan got a break when the whistle blew just as Smits was ripping it away.

Jordan somehow won the jump. Steve Kerr wound up with an open 3-point shot on the right wing. The game was tied. The message was sent. One way or anotherJordan was going to drag his team to Salt Lake Cityto its sixth championship series. He had 28 points9 rebounds8 assists but had no knockout punches in him. What he had was heart and guile and the understandingas he told his teammatesthat it was time to ''shut up and play.''

Jordan's overall fatigue andyeshis inevitable decline could be found in his shooting. Twenty-five shots attemptednine madeand another five free throws missed. He was so tired that when he tried to drive at one point in the fourth quarterhe staggerednearly to the floor.

''I was tired,'' he admitted. ''Very tired.''

Larry Bird's defense essentially worked. He still lostand hebetter than anyoneknew why. ''I remember when I was a player and not shooting well,'' Bird said. ''I had to help in any way I could. Michael's jump shot didn't beat usbut he put his head down and went at Rik. He distributed the ballgot some big rebounds. That's part of what makes him perhaps the greatest player ever.''
 2961,  2002, a, Mr. Thomas says the Democrats simply cannot handle the idea that Republicansnot Democratsare moving to deliver a sweeping new entitlement to the nation's elderly or the idea that the Democrats are no longer running the show as the majority.

''Their biggest problem,'' he said in an interview''is not that the majority is fair -- and fairer than they were -- when we work our will. It is that we are the majority and they are not. And for members who were around for a long timewho came in when the Democrats were the majoritywho grew up in the committee system as the majority and who expected to finish their careers as chairmen of the committeesit is a veryvery frustrating time because Republicans came in and took away their birthright.''

Mr. Thomas's relationships with the Democratsnotably with Representative Charles B. RangelDemocrat of New Yorkwho would be the Ways and Means chairman if the Democrats controlled the Househave been fraying for a long time. But even some Republicans complain at times about Mr. Thomas's edge. Some textile-state Republicans sharply criticized him last weeksaying he had blindsided them with changes in a trade bill.

His allies acknowledge the problem. ''He doesn't suffer fools welland that's not to say anyone's a fool,'' said Representative Jim McCreryRepublican of Louisiana. ''But I know that he knows that that's a fault of hisand that for the last couple of years he's been working on ittrying to become more tolerant in more situations.''

Mr. Thomas's temper was an issue when he sought the chairmanship in 2000but his policy expertise and legislative skill clearly outweighed it. With the backing of J. Dennis Hastertthe speaker of the Househe won the post over a more senior Republican on the committee.

 1927,  2008, a, While G.O.P. veep choice Sarah Palin is likely most concerned with her daughter’s present conditionJake Tapper at Political Punch has a blast from her past:

Officials of the Alaskan Independence Party say that Palin was once so independentshe was once a member of their partywhichsince the 1970shas been pushing for a legal vote for Alaskans to decide whether or not residents of the 49th state can secede from the United States. And while McCain’s motto — as seen in a new TV ad — is “Country First,” the AIP’s motto is the exact opposite — “Alaska First — Alaska Always.”

“Individuallyyou can come to your own judgment about how consequential these stories are,” writes Josh Marshall at Talking Points Memo. “What they show pretty clearly now — in addition to the news that the McCain campaign is only now sending in a vetting team — is that John McCain didn’t do any serious vetting of Palin before he invited her to join his ticket andhe hopesbecome Vice President of the United States. Fundamentallyof coursethis is about John McCain. And the real issue here is what this slapdash decision says about his judgment.”

(Update: Tapper has a new post that indicates there’s no paper trail to prove Palin was involved with the separatist party.)

 5760,  1985, a, The long-simmering merger between the Generals and the Houston Gamblers reached the boiling point yesterday when Harry Usherthe commissioner of the United States Football Leaguesaid that the clubs' owners would be at a news conference today to ''announce details of their teams' future in the U.S.F.L.''

Although league officials refused to elaboratethere seemed to be little doubt that Donald Trumpthe New York real estate man who owns the Generalsand Stephen Rossthe New York real estate man who heads a syndicate that is buying the Gamblershad finally concluded an agreement to merge their teams. Trump was unavailable for commentand Ross declined comment.

''I heard it was all signedsealed and delivered - we're going to be playing in New Jersey,'' declared Jim Kellythe Gamblers' quarterbackwho said he had been told of the plans by Gambler officials.

Kellythe league's leading quarterback last seasonwould be expected to take over as quarterback of the merged teamsbut it was unclear what might happen to the Generals' starterDoug Flutiethe high-paid rookie from Boston College who was signed to a long-term contract by Trump after he won the Heisman Trophy last fall.
 2970,  2002, a, ''What I've heard from neighborsand not from policewas that one of the young men involved had a girlfriend who was seriously injured,'' Ms. Preckwinkle saidstanding this afternoon near the crumbling stone steps where the truck came to rest.

''It sounds to me as if he just went berserk and attacked the drivers of the vehicle,'' she said. ''And the speculation is that he was assisted by some of his friends or others in the crowd.''

The police had one man in custody this afternoon in connection with the killingsthe authorities said. They would not identify the manbut said that he was considered a suspect and that charges were pending.

The authorities said they were speaking with several others but had not yet identified anyone other than the man in custody as a suspect.

Witnesses have told the police that as many as six men may have taken part in the beatings.

At a news conference todaySupt. Terry Hillard of the Chicago Police Department asked the public for help in catching the killers.

''A thug is a thug is a thug is a thug,'' Mr. Hillard said. ''These are murderers. They killed two individuals. One of them was a senior citizen.''

The authorities identified the dead men as Jack Moore62and Anthony Stuckey49. Both lived within a few blocks of where they were dragged from the rental truck.

 6235,  1973, a, SAIGONSouth VietnamThursdayFeb. 1—Fighting continued to sputter and flare in South Vietnam yesterday as the cease‐fire went into its fifth day.

A South Vietnamese military spokesman said yesterday that there was a slight decrease in the level of military activity during the last 24 hoursbut he dismissed the reduction as “not significant.”

EarlierAmerican analysts had said that they expected the level of fighting to subside to something approaching a real cease‐fire by last night.

The South Vietnamese do not report any violations of the cease‐fire by their own troopsand there were no available (reports from the Communists yesterday. In the past the Vietcong command has said that its troops were “scrupulously” adhering to the terms of the cease‐fire and that the Saigon Government's forces were repeatedly violating them.
 3338,  2000, a, In a move intended to shore up support for the planned merger of the London and Frankfurt stock exchangesthe clearinghouses for the two markets introduced a plan today that would cut settlement costs by 90 percent for certain trades.

Brokers have expressed concern about the potential for escalating costs should the London and Frankfurt exchanges combine to form a pan-European bourse called iX. Winning the support of brokers is crucial for the London Stock Exchange in its attempts to ward off a hostile bid from OM Gruppen A.B.the Swedish company that runs the Stockholm stock exchange.

''It's a good workable blueprint,'' said Brian Mairsa spokesman for the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers.

While today's proposal went a long way toward addressing shareholder concernsquestions about how the savings would be achieved and who would benefit the most underscore the difficulty that European stock exchanges were facing as they tried folding dissimilar technologies and regulations into one entity. A certain amount of overlap in terms of how trades are settled has led some shareholders of the London Stock Exchange to call the proposal a political Band-Aidrather than the most economically viable solution.

Even as summer starts to melt into fallthousands of landscapers and exterminators throughout the region continue to spreadspray and squirt an ocean of potent pesticides every day. Whether they use a hose to wipe out grubs on a sprawling bluegrass lawn or a slender wand to surprise pests in the hidey-holes of a houseapplicators are expected to be state certified and trained to handle chemicals safely.

But environmental groups say that the training and testing of applicators is far from adequateand that inexperienced workers pose a danger to residentsworkers andin some casesthemselves.

While the pest control industry says mistakes are relatively raresome serious accidents involving pesticides have raised concerns about current laws:

The owner of an exotic bird shop in Queens went out of business in January after most of her 400 macawscockatoos and parrots died after pesticides were sprayed at the McDonald's restaurant next door by an improperly certified exterminator.

More than 35 people at a girls' softball game in MoreauN.Y.were taken to a local hospital in 2001 after the teenage son of a local landscaper mistakenly sprayed an insecticide for mosquitoes while the game was still being played. The teenager did not have the proper certification.

 4872,  1991, a, TINKA TOPPING'S dream of academic paradise stands in a potato field in Bridgehampton. "When my children were youngI envisioned them attending a country school," Ms. Topping said. "The school bus would pick them up every morningand they would drive off to paradise."

Because the schools near where the Toppings lived in Sagaponack were not quite the educational Edens Ms. Topping had in mindshe and other East End parents founded their own schoolthe Hampton Day School. It was 1966and in the Age of Aquarius everything seemed possible.

The parents took over a farmhouse and a barn and started an alternative school. Twenty-five years later it still exists. But with the exception of Ms. Toppingwho recently rejoined the Hampton Day boardlittle remains the same in the private school world of the Hamptons.

Truman Capotean original supporter of Hampton Dayis no longer around to champion its cause. In the 70's fiscal problems caused the high school portion to close. And in 1987 a group of teachers and parents splintered off and created the Waterfront School in Sag Harbor. The defectorsas one Hampton Day parent calls themtook up residence in a building overlooking Sag Harbor's harbor.

 4408,  1993, a, "The Distinguished Gentleman" has a lot more credibility than most fish-out-of-water comediessince it actually bothers to explain how a con man could find his way to Congress. The facts add upand they're funnytoo. Brisk direction by Jonathan Lynn and a savvy screenplay by Marty Kaplan give this a lot more snap than the average cookie-cutter comedy. What's moreEddie Murphy is back at the top of his formand he's not being raweither. This film has some mildly raunchy momentsbut by and large it's a holiday comedy that works for both adults and children.

"Leap of Faith" is worth recommending for a fineintricate performance by Steve Martin in a non-comic roleand for other equally chancy toucheslike a plot hinging on the question of religious faith. As a fraudulent faith healerMr. Martin holds this interestingly offbeat drama together until it quite literally reaches the point of no return. Two bonuses: a jaunty performance by Debra Winger as the faith healer's jaded managerand a glorious gospel score.

"Aladdin" remains a guaranteed crowd-pleaser. For handkerchief appealthere's "Lorenzo's Oil," a medical detective story that avoids inspirational corn. For sheer outrageousnessthere's "Bad Lieutenant." And "The Crying Game" is still the cleverest film of the season.

 977,  2013, a, The United States Department of Agriculture will relax a decades-long ban on the importation of many cured-pork products from some regions of Italy starting May 28greatly increasing the number and variety of salumi in markets and restaurants here.

On Fridaythe department’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services announced that an in-country assessment had determined that four regions and two provinces in Northern Italy are free of swine vesicular diseasea dangerous communicable ailment that infects pigsand that “the importation of pork or pork products from these areas presents a low risk.”

Some pork importers and producersin this country and in Italycelebrated the changessaying they would allow more Italian cured-pork products to make their way to American tables.

But others were unable to judge the ultimate impact of the ruling because the Inspection Services did not specify what standards would now have to be met by Italian producersnor the expense of meeting them. Despite repeated requeststhe agency did not immediately provide more details about its decision.

“Once this rule is in effectimports will be approved,” said Lyndsay Colea spokeswoman for the Inspection Servicesreferring to the May 28 date“but some individual shipments may need to be certified in the future.”

Presentlyonly about half of Italy’s wide variety of cold cuts are approved for import into the United Statesaccording to Italy’s Association of Meat and Cold Cuts Producers. “Up until nowwe could only export seasoned hamfor examplelike Parma and San Danieleand cooked ham or mortadella,” said Davide Calderonethe association’s director.

“We will soon be able to export pancettasalamicoppa — potentially all the Italian cold cuts with no exception,” he addedestimating that this could mean an increase of $9 million to $13 million a year in Italian cold cuts exported to the United Statesnow put at $90 million.

According to Friday’s rulingthe areas where the salami ban will be relaxed include the regions of LombardiaEmilia-RomagnaVeneto and Piemonteand the provinces of Trento and Bolzanoall in the north. Mr. Calderone said that those regions include some of the country’s most productive slaughterhouseswhich will now be able to gain United States certification. “Americans will finally enjoy ‘antipasto all’Italiana’ at its fullest extent,” he said.

But American cold-cuts producers were skepticalsaying that although the Agriculture Department announced a reduction in the threat of swine vesicular disease“Italian producers will still have to meet U.S.D.A. guidelines for listeriasalmonella and E. coli,” said Marc Buzziothe president of Salumeria Biellesea New Jersey producer of artisanal salamis and charcuterie products. “Only certain processing plants in Italy meet the U.S.D.A. guidelinesand those are associated with the larger producers.”

He added: “Nowmore cold cuts will be coming inbut the question iswill it be a better product than that of artisanal producers in the United States?”

Since the banbelieved to have been in effect at least since the 1970s after a series of European livestock diseasesMr. Buzzio estimated that certification for Italian producers cost as much as $100,000a price beyond many artisanal producershe said.

If indeed artisanal salami is approved for importation“it could open up a new world of Italian salami to the United States,” said Joseph Bastianichan owner of the Eataly grocery stores in the United States. “Americans have been eating bad salami foreverbut now the end is near.”

George Faisona partner at DeBragga and Spitlera New Jersey-based meat and poultry retaileracknowledged that the Italian regions specified by the Agriculture Department produce some of the best salami in the worldbut he said that the American importation standards “will determine the quality of what comes over from Italy.”

A future increase in Italian importshe added“won’t harm United States artisanal producersbecause it will show Americans just how good the quality of their own producers has become.”

Other reaction was more cautious. “As an AmericanI welcome it with open arms,” said Pat LaFriedaan owner of Pat LaFrieda Meat Purveyors in New Jersey“as long as the Italians import just as many American products.” There are restrictions on exporting American beef and other meats to Italy.

If the government has indeed rescinded restrictions on the sale of imported Italian artisanal salamiit would also change a way of life for many delicacy-loving tourists and Italian-Americanswho have smuggled in Italian salamis for private consumptionand sometimes for sale.

This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

 3192,  2001, a, Of the new domains.biz and .info are farthest along the pipelinehaving begun accepting applications for addresses over the summer. Some of those new addresses began operating last month.

As is the case with .com.net and .org addressesa .biz or .info address can be obtained through an accredited registrar. A list of accredited registrars is available at www.icann.org or at the Web sites run by the registries.

Prices for the new addresses are similar to those of other domains$10 to $35 a year. Consumers can shop for the best rate. Higher prices do not necessarily mean better serviceso check the fine print for services like renewal notification and make sure that there is a phone number and an address for the companynot just an e-mail link.

Early Problems

The registries responsible for .biz and .infoNeuLevel Inc. and Afilias Ltd.respectivelyhave both had some glitches. Last summer NeuLevel charged a nonrefundable fee of $2 for each .biz address applicationintending to select one application at random if there was more than one applicant for an address. That led to a lawsuitstill pendingclaiming that the process constituted an illegal lottery. In the meantime.biz addresses for which there was only one application began functioning in early October. NeuLevel plans to open real-time registration on Wednesdayso that applications will be processed as they are submitted.

Afilias used a different procedure for .info namesallowing trademark owners to submit applications for addresses (Coke.infofor example) before opening the system to the public. Loopholes enabled some people to register .info addresses using false trademark datathough Afilias has promised to challenge those registrations and invalidate any made with false information. Despite that glitchAfilias opened its system to general registration in Septemberand .info addresses registered in the preliminary phase began functioning in October. Once againsome domain resellers have been busy buying up names so some .biz and .info addresses have already been taken.

Afilias said that more than 500,000 .info names had been registered. NeuLevel said it had registered 289,000 names during its initial phasewhich ended in late September. By comparisonmore than 24.3 million .com4.9 million .netand 3.2 million .org addresses have been registeredaccording to VeriSignso plenty of choices are left in the new domains.

Next: Dot-Name

The next new domain that may be of interest to consumers is .namewhich is intended to offer individuals distinct addresses for their Web sitesin the format john.smith.name. Global Name Registrythe company managing the .name domainalso plans to offer e-mail forwarding services so that .name domain holders can receive e-mail at addresses like john@smith.name.

 5603,  1986, a, An interest in playwriting led Ms. Vance to acting lessons and a stinteventuallyat a ''boot camp for actors'' in London. ''I came back planning to play Lady Macbeth and Juliet but no one thought I looked like themI guess,'' the black feminist comedian said. ''I did not become a household word in the weeks I've given myself to be one.'' She'd been a star of sorts acting comic monologues in high school in Chicago. Boarding in that city with her grandparents after her return to the Statesshe took to sneaking out late at night to perform in small comedy clubs.

''It is so difficult to get up and make people laugh,'' she said. ''I didn't use my real name. I called myself 'Some Little Colored Girl.' But people did laugh. I started making money. 'This is too good,' I thought. 'I'll go suffer in New York.' '' Invited to perform at a black feminists' conferenceMs. Vance arrived here in 1981. She soon found herself playing a leading role in a production of ''Native Son.'' Other acting jobs followed in small theaters around townbut she counts a highly popular and well-received season at La Mama last year as her breakthroughafter which she joined ''Saturday Night Live.''

Described as a cross between Little Richard and Laurie AndersonMs. Vance does monologues with songs performed with her back-up groupthe Mell-o White Boyswhich includes Steve CanaleRob Yampolsky and Ron Stach. But it is her characters -zany and poignant walking satires on life today - who stand out unforgettably. Among those she may play on Sunday are Flotilda Williamghetto Shakespearean actressin ''Romeo and Juliet''; Harriet Heterothe Feminist Stripper; Tracy Dance Donaldsonthe rhythm therapist whoto lines from Elizabeth Barrett Browning set to Motown musicteaches whites to get with it; Cabrini Greena young but knowing unwed motherand Robin the Reluctant Transsexual.

Where does the inspiration come from? ''Real lifemy very rich fantasy lifeand things I think people should be thinking about from a different point of view,'' Ms. Vance said. ''My fascist life - arbiter of culture.'' 'How Heat Drives People Crazy'

The Alien Comic works with ''topical humor,'' as he puts it. Mr. Murrin tackles any subjecttelling stories and roaring with manic energy and innocence through a mess of trash propssome of which he wears. On Sunday he is likely to perform a new piece called ''Hot Enough for You?'' ''I might call it 'Hot and Humid Rules,' '' he said - a title inspired by graffiti he has observed. ''I try to do shows that kind of fit in someplace. This will be about how heat drives people crazy and humidity drives them over the edge. How to cope with it. A lot of my shows are false lectures.''

He got his current alias from a club manager on the West Coast. ''What's this guy?'' the man remarked as he listened to a description of Mr. Murrin's work. ''Sounds pretty alien to me.''

Mr. Murrin left Los Angeleswhere he worked as a lawyer specializing in criminal law in the 1960'sto come to New York and be a writer. ''I wrote fiction,'' he recalled''but it wasn't very good.'' A play by Sam Shepard at La Mama turned him to playwriting. ''Oh boycan they do this on stage?'' he remembered thinking at the time. He took his new work to Ellen StewartLa Mama's venerable founder and directorwho pronounced the first few plays ''not so good,'' Mr. Murrin recalled. She found the next ones ''O.K.'' and produced themand he went on to work with such luminaries of the times as John Vaccaro.

 5038,  1990, a, To the Editor:

While it is heartwarming to read of the continued interest in the golden age of radio (About New York columnNov. 14)it is like reading the obituary of one who is not dead.

Whenever I tell people that I produce radio dramathey invariably respond"Ohyou mean like 'The Shadow'!" It is this image of radio theater frozen in time that is responsible for the stagnation of an incredibly rich art form in this country.

All across Americaproducers work at radio theaternot recreating the golden agebut rather bringing modern sensibilities and fresh imagination to a medium with almost limitless potential for communication. For the last 10 yearsthe Midwest Radio Theater Conferenceheld in ColumbiaMo.has attracted hundreds of young writersactors and producersfascinated by the chance to create new work in sound.

 6268,  1973, a, Mayor Lindsayin appealing for approval of the transportation bond issuesaid:

“The preservation of the 35‐cent fare on the city's subways and buses through state‐matching subsidies and the maintenance of present fares on the commuter railroads is a principle which I have long supported.

“While the bond issue is not the only means through which this essential objective can be achievedit is clear that it is the only one which has the support of the Governor and majority leaders in the State Senate and Assembly.”

The Mayorwho has disagreed with Governor Rockefeller on many matterssaid it was “unfortunate” that no details had been made public on priorities in spending the bond money. But he added:

“Despite these drawbacksI believe thaton balancethe transportation bond issue will be to the benefit of this city. Preservation of the fare at current levels and assuring state funds for additional subway construction outweigh the negative aspects of the proposition.”

In his message to the City Planning CommissionMr. Lindsayas is traditionaldid not say precisely how much he wanted for each of the priority items.

HoweverMr. Grossman pointed out that since in previous years Mayor Lindsay's administration had spent a great deal on construction of police stations and firehousesmuch of the apital money for the coming year was intended for anticrime technologysuch as the new voice‐alarm boxes and funds for block‐security programs.

The Budget Director also said that if the proposed exclusion of sewer construction and anti ‐ pollution facilities from the debt limit was voted downthe city would be forced to cut its construction of such projects.

The Planning Commissionafter three days of hearings early in Decemberis to submit its draft for the capital budget to the Mayor on Jan. 2. By Feb. 1the new Mayor is to give his executive capital budget to the City Council for its consideration.

 4431,  1993, a, Two new polls indicate that Americans are deeply divided over President Clinton's job performance so farand are almost evenly split over the first major issue his Administration has tackledthe ban on homosexuals in the armed forces.

A poll conducted by the Gallup Organization for Newsweek magazine showed that although 51 percent of those surveyed approved of Mr. Clinton's job performance 32 percent disapproved. It is the highest disapproval rating for any new President since such surveys were begun in the 1950's.

For most other Presidentsdisapproval ratings this early in their first term were in single digits. The only exception -- and the previous high -- was a 13 percent disapproval rating for Ronald Reagan after the first week of his Presidency in January 1981Newsweek reported.

The latest pollbased on 774 telephone interviews conducted last Thursday and Fridayhad a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.

 698,  2015, a, A celebration of spinning vinyl and twirling teenagers“Northern Soul” captures a briefblazing moment in 1970s England when the passionate lyrics and addictive beats of American soul ignited dance floors and working-class dreams.

Two dreamers take center stage. John (Elliot James Langridge)a high school misfit and all-around mopeis dazzled and flattered when Matt (Joshua Whitehouse)a skinny show-off and virtual orphanbefriends him at the youth club. Introduced to flared trousers and flashy dance moves — with a side order of aggro and amphetamines — John is soon a willing member of the cult of rare recordings.

Funny and feistygritty and sometimes grimthis first feature from the photographer Elaine Constantine delivers a sweaty snapshot of a very specific time and place. Surrounded by industrial drabnessthe dance halls of Lancashire pulse with light and movement. Squeaky-clean pop is fadingand disco is waiting in the wingsbut for these kidsit’s Edwin Starr and Frankie Valli who offer escape from sausage factory futures and nagging parents.

Performed with loose energy and studded with beautifully observant moments — like the worn spot on the hideous bedroom carpet where John practices his spins — “Northern Soul” suffers most from a lack of dramatic focus and a tendency to elbow women out of the frame. There’s tragedyand there is disillusionbut Ms. Constantine’s writing is no match for her empathy and ability to conjure atmosphere. That saidthe songs are smashing and the stomping joy infectioussmoothly summoning the way music can inject hope into the bleakest of lives.

 2965,  2002, a, Mr. Daschlein portraying the Democrats' resolve to cope with injusticecited the major provisions of a bill dealing with auditing and corporate responsibilitywhich the Senate will take up next week. The billunlike the House versionis not supported by the accounting industryand Mr. Daschle predicted its prompt passage because public concern about corporate crime is ''skyrocketing.''

The battle over business took an even narrower turn in dueling news conferences in the House. Mr. Gephardt started the duel by announcing that he was filing a discharge petitiona procedure that can compel a vote on a measureon what he said was a bill to ''stamp out one of the most glaringunpatriotic examples of corporate malfeasance.'' The bill would eliminate tax advantages for companies that moved abroad.

That issue is a centerpiece only in the Congressional race in Connecticut between Representatives Jim Maloneya Democratand Nancy L. Johnsona Republican. Mr. Maloney has been making political hay with the issue because of the decision by the Stanley Works in New Britain to make Bermuda its headquarters.

Republicans responded with a proposal by Representative Bill Thomas of Californiachairman of the Ways and Means Committeefor changes in the tax code so companies would not want to move. Democrats said this was another giveawayand even Speaker J. Dennis Hastert seemed uncertain whether the Thomas proposal was going anywhere.

In factbecause Republicans sign discharge petitions only under the greatest pressure (as on campaign finance legislation)Mr. Gephardt's effort has no chance of success in compelling a House vote on the Democratic bill. But then the prescription drug bill that the House passed early Friday morningwhile dealing with a bigger issuehas no chance in the Senate.

This yearthoughbills do not have to go anywhere. Except for necessities like appropriations or raising the limit on the national debtnot only the talk but nearly all the legislating is all about the November elections -- and the vague hope that one party will gain big enough majorities to actually get bills passed.

 5660,  1986, a, John Turner won a resounding endorsement today for his continued leadership of the Liberal Party at a national convention.

Delegates to the convention voted to keep Mr. Turner by a margin of 2,001 to 622.

Gathering 76.3 percent of the voteMr. Turner considerably surpassed the total various foes had said would be necessary for him to continue.

Mr. Turner's victory represents a major comeback from his September 1984 defeat by the Progressive Conservative Partyled by Brian Mulroney.

''Now I know that I have your confidence,'' Mr. Turner told the convention. He said his task now would be to prepare for a federal election in 1988.

MONDAY PUZZLE — It’s always nice to see a puzzle that celebrates my hometownand Jeffrey Wechsler returns to do just that.

There are four theme entries today that have good old New York City hidden in them and three of the four entries — DESTINY CALLS (which I heard in my head as “destiny awaitsexcept that didn’t fit)FELONY CHARGE and COMPANY CAR — are making their debuts. Mr. Wechsler wraps that up by stretching the city’s nickname — THE BIG APPLE — across the center of the grid.

I hit a speed bump in the northeastan oddity on a Mondaybecause I was not familiar with the actor JON SEDA. On the other handI really liked the long Down entriesWHAT’S MY LINE and WOULD WE EVER.

Did you get a rise out of the clue for 30 Across? The answer is YEAST.

Your thoughts?
 5918,  1983, a, If nobody complainedwhy the convulsion? Because those paying more than their share of costs were not prevented from finding alternatives. Lured by new technologythe F.C.C.starting in the late 50'sgradually let competitors skim the cream from Ma Bell's commercial and long-distance services - the very ones that were subsidizing local rates. And when the ensuing antitrust actions led to a divorce of A.T. & T.'s long- and short-distance systemsthe F.C.C. had to find a way to replace the subsidies from long to short.

Though every phone is billed locallymost will still be served by several companies: Ma Bell's regional offspringand long-distance connectors like A.T. & T. and its competitors. The economically pure remedy would be to charge every phone line $7 more a monththe amount of the old system's subsidy to local service. But that would ignite a rebellion against any change.

So the F.C.C. decided to shift the burden graduallyto charge business phones more than residential and to justify the higher charge by calling it a fee for ''access'' to the interstate system. This rationalization has gone down poorly with consumers trained to restrain their long-distance calls. And it has complicated the job of state regulators who may have to let local phone rates double in a decade. There are fears the increases will drive poorer families off the phone griddestroying the universal service that benefits everyone. Congress already feels pressure to preserve the subsidies from long-distance to short. What's wrong with that? The short answer is efficiency. Technology promises many new conveniencesand savingsthrough long-distance communication; society will reap the benefits only if costs are properly allocated. A further answer is that innovations like cable and satellites will make it easier for high-volume business communicators to bypass the phone network altogether; stick them with the subsidy and they'll soon be unreachable. The best answer is that a carefully planned reform need not threaten universal servicewhile accurate pricing could produce billions in new benefits. The number of people who would drop phone service priced at full cost is probably very small; a tripling of rates tomorrow would leave the average family paying no more of its income for basic service than in 1950. And if Congress wants to protect the very poorthe least distorting way is to subsidize their phones directly. Or state regulators could freeze the cost of a no-frills service for the poor. But the truer the price for everyone elsethe broader the social gain. Underpricing local calls may enrich a shut-in's communication with neighborsbut it severely limits communication with grandchildren or friends far away. And artificially high long-distance prices raise the price of everything else: business calls that might cost $2 end up in a letter that costs $3.50 to type. Small changeperhapsuntil it dawns that Americans make 300 billion telephone calls a year. Will price reform improve service? Not if rate increases are beaten down politically and local phone companies are left starving. But a gradual approach to real costs can yield ever more efficiencies. Much depends on the political skilland courageof regulators and the understanding of the public.

 4552,  1993, a, Bob Woolfthe pioneering Boston-based sports lawyer who used what he called friendly persuasion to negotiate headline contracts for some of the nation's most famous athletes and entertainersdied on Monday night at a home he maintained in HallandaleFla. He was 65.

"He was watching 'Monday Night Football' and he just didn't wake up," his daughter Stacey Woolf-Feinberg said yesterday. "He was in the peak of health and had been playing tons of tennis." She said an autopsy would determine the cause of death.

 2370,  2005, a, LOS ANGELESFeb. 28 - An hour after the last of the golden statuettes had been handed out at the 77th Academy Awardstransforming the lives of several honorees for the bettera similar shift was taking place at Morton'swhere Vanity Fair has given its Oscar night party for 12 years.

During the televised ceremonythis restaurant was tame by Hollywood standards: Kirk Douglas stared up at the ceiling as if contemplating a bon mot from one of his dinner companionsthe novelist Jackie Collins.

But moments laterwhen the awards endedtables were whisked awayand a swarm of people suddenly filled the cavernous restaurant and a tent pitched behind it. It was as if the rich and famous were all given the secret Vanity Fair alert and gathered togetherlike silvery salmon swimming upstream -- in their feathers and jewelswith sweeping trains and cropped furs -- sharing celebrity secrets in the murky post-Oscar night.

"The Vanity Fair party is as if they let the animals out of their cagesat least for a couple of hours," said the photographer Todd Eberle. He was correct in the sense that major stars like Tom Cruisewho showed up in a Ducati motorcycle jacketand Cate Blanchettcarrying her statue for best supporting actressgadded about without the aid of the customary band of handlers. And he was also correct metaphoricallysince when it came to dishing about red-carpet fashionthe proximity to such raw meat meant that the claws came out.

 3027,  2002, a, Soon after the Persian Gulf war in 1991the United States and Qatar quietly signed a defense cooperation agreement that provided Washington with what one official called a ''big green light'' to set up operations here. In recent yearsQatar has emerged as vital real estate for United States military strategy in the Persian Gulf.

One crucial base is As Sayliyaha 262-acre installation completed in August 2000 at a cost of more than $100 million. The base has more than 20 climate-controlled warehousesstoring hundreds of M1 tanksBradley fighting vehicles and other armored vehicles. It is capable of housing enough armored equipment for a heavy Army brigade. It includes a community center and living quarters for the approximately 300 American troops who have been permanently based there.

Qatar's willingness to allow the United States to build and operate the base is a breakthrough for the Pentagonand it represents a level of cooperation that far outstrips what the Saudis have been prepared to offer. After the gulf warwhen Vice President Dick Cheney was the defense secretaryhe went to Saudi Arabia to discuss storing a division's worth of Army equipment therebut the Saudis turned him down.

Armored vehicles and other weapons from As Sayliyah have been quietly shipped to Kuwaita transfer that the Pentagon initially cast as an exercise but that is seen as a preparation for war. Soldiers from the Third Infantry Divisionwhich is expected to play a key role if there is an invasion of Iraqrumble around Kuwait on well-maintainedmodern armored vehicles that still bear the shipping labels from the Qatar installation.

After the United States began shipping armored equipment out of As Sayliyahthe military started to install communications equipment there for the command center that General Franks and his staff will use to conduct the exercise. Western officials say the Qataris have long suggested that Central Command establish a headquarters hereand the exercise may be the first step.

It is what the military calls a command post exercisemeaning that the top American commanders will carry out a war game that will simulate a campaign against an enemy in the regionbut will not involve the deployment of troops. Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf conducted such an exercise in July 1990 in TampaFla.that used the scenario of an Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabia.

American commanders have not disclosed the classified scenario that they plan to use for the war game. But it is clear that the exercise will enable the military to test the command and control procedures it would use if there is a war with Iraq.

 1400,  2011, a, What a difference four years make.

In the race for the 2008 Republican presidential nominationthe candidates Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee seemed to take every chance to disparage each another. Each took potshots at the other’s stands on the issues and their track records. OnceMr. Romney even criticized Mr. Huckabeewho upended Mr. Romney’s plans to win the Iowa caucuses with a surprise victoryfor his diction.

But on Saturday nightwhen Mr. Huckabeenow a Fox News hostinterviewed his former rival on his show about Mr. Romney’s 2012 campaignthings were different. They sat smiling and occasionally offering compliments. They were polite.

For some perspectivehere is a representative television appearance by the two from 2008 campaign. (The captions are not by The New York Times.)

On SaturdayMr. Huckabeewho is not running for president this yearsaid to his guest that many viewers had tuned in wondering“Would you and I be able to sit in the same room and be civil to each other?”

“I think we’ve proven that people can be civil.”

And that wasperhapsbecause Mr. Huckabee seemed to pull some of the punches that might have been irresistible four years ago.

At one pointMr. Romney replied to an abortion-rights question by saying he believed that life began at conceptionand he spoke of his desire to see the United States Supreme Court’s landmark abortion rights decisionRoe v. Wadeoverturned. Immediately afterwardhe seemed to draw less of a hard linesaying he would leave the decision to permit the procedure up to the states.

In responseMr. Huckabee likened that approach to the conditions in the country before the Civil Warbut he just as quickly abandoned that idea.

Four years agoMr. Huckabeewho opposes abortion rightsfrequently used Mr. Romney’s less-stringent stance as ammunitionand framed Mr. Romney’s view as “flip-flopping.”

But there were smiles and cordiality on Saturday night. Mr. Romney even asked Mr. Huckabeea former governor of Arkansaswhy he had not entered the fray this year. (His response was that he could not run and also continue his television show.) Mr. Romney went so far as to say it would have been “terrific” if Mr. Huckabee had once again run.

 1734,  2009, a, When I saw that Michelle Malkin will be on the Stephanopoulos panel this weekmy first thought was that nobody as far to the left as she is to the right would ever appear on such a panel. But then I started to wonder (a) what I mean by that (b) if it’s true.

I don’t want to be like Bill O’Reillywho considers anyone he disagrees with a “far-left” activist. So we need some objective metric. The most natural would seem to be voter opinion: what fraction of the American public is to Malkin’s right? Would somebody with an equally small number of people to his or her left get on a Sunday morning panel?

The troubleof courseis how to measure that. In principleit shouldn’t be hard. What I’d like to have is a Guttman scale of positions on political matterssuch that almost everyone who gave the “liberal” answer to question 7 also gave liberal answers to questions 1-6while almost everyone who gave the conservative answer to question 7 also gave conservative answers to questions 8-13. And we’d want population shares associated with each point on the scale. So we could then take known positions of public figures and place them on the scale: saywe might find that only 19 percent of Americans are to the right of Michelle Malkinwhile 23 percent are to the left of Michael Moore.

But if there are any such data availableI don’t know about them. Anyone care to put them together?

Before “Friday Night Lights” was developed into one of best dramas in recent network historyit existed onscreen as a solid adaptation of Buzz Bissinger’s nonfiction book about a football-obsessed small town in Texas. Director Peter Berg doesn’t have time to explore fully the characters and social complexities of Bissinger’s bookbut he does capture the pressure-cooker atmosphere of a place where football is religion. All that pressure is brought to bear on the coach (Billy Bob Thornton)who’s expected to win every game or lose his job.

“A Most Violent Year” is the perfect example of the type of top-drawer production that would have thrived in theaters in the ’60s and ’70s — it might have shared marquee space with a film like “Serpico” — but doesn’t fit any contemporary model for success. This superb third feature from J.C. Chandor (“Margin Call,” “All Is Lost”) stars Oscar Isaac as a straight-arrow heating-oil magnate who has to bend the rules when payments on a new waterfront fuel yard come due and his drivers are suddenly harassed by violent carjackings. That leads some of the drivers to start carryingthemselves. We watch as a good man is led down the road to corruption.

The unexpectedly sharp declinewhich followed a week in which storms kept many workers from claims officeswas regarded by many as evidence that the economy's growing strength was spreading into the job market.

"I think you're going to see further improvement," predicted Daniel Laufenbergan economist for IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis. Gains in outputhe addedhave so far been mainly a result of unsustainably rapid increases in productivitywith new hiring expected to follow inevitably.

At the same timehoweveranalysts said that the drop in jobless claimsto an average of 341,250 over the latest four weeksstill owed more to a slowing in layoffs than to the generation of new jobs.

 1347,  2011, a, After emergency rule was officially lifted in Bahrain on Wednesdayprotesters who took to the streets in some places were dispersed with birdshot and teargas fired by the security forcesa rights activist told Agence France-Presse.

The activist reported that there had been clashes in three villages: Bani JamraDiraz and Karzakan. Video uploaded to social networking sites on Wednesday appeared to support that report.

The blogger who posted this video on YouTube said that it was filmed in Bani Jamra on Wednesdayas the security forces fired to disperse protesters chanting“Peaceful! Peaceful!”

According to another Bahraini bloggerAbu Sayed Mujtabaa short clip he posted on Yfrog showed protesters in the village of Diraz fleeing as shots were fired at a march there.

This secretly filmed clip appears to show the security forces firing somethingpossibly teargasin the town of Karazakkanin western Bahrain:

This brief clip is one of two said to show shots of some kind being fired at protesters in Sanabisoutside Bahrain’s capitalManamaon Wednesday:

This video is also said to have been filmed in Sanabis on Wednesdayand shows a march and a clash between protesters and the security forces:

According to a Bahraini activist who writes on Twitter as Choco196this video shows the wounds sustained by one protester in Sanabispossibly from bird shot:

Despite what appears to be video evidence of clashesBahrain’s interior ministry posted a brief statement on Twitter denying the accounts of witnesses who told Al Jazeera that the security forces had fired at protesters.

Also on Wednesdayan Irish human rights campaignerMary Lawlorreported that she was “denied the chance to testify” in a military court that is hearing a case against one of Bahrain’s leading human rights activistsAbdulhadi Alkhawaja. According to Ms. Lawlorthe AmericanBritishFrenchDanish and Swedish embassies in Bahrain sent representatives to observe Mr. Alkhawaja’s trialwhich is being presided over by a uniformed military officer.

Mr. Alkhawaja’s daughterMaryamwho works for the Bahrain Center for Human Rightsreported on Twitter that her sisterZainabhas been asked to appear at a police station in Bahrain on Thursday. After her father and husband were arrested in AprilZainab Alkhawajawho writes on Twitter as angryarabiyastaged a hunger strike in an attempt to press Bahrain’s government to release her family members.

The Alkhawaja family has also featured prominently in a conspiracy theory promoted by some supporters of Bahrain’s royal family who claim that they were part of a plot backedimprobablyby the United States and Iran to destabilize the kingdom.

As Roy Gutman reported this week for McClatchy newspapersthe conspiracy theorists became obsessed with an American diplomat who recently left the U.S. Embassy in BahrainLudovic Hoodwhose job it was to record human rights violations.

The Alkhawajas and Mr. Hood were linked in a longerratic blog post written last month for the Bahrain Independenta Web site that features articles with headlines like“Trust in Your King.” They were also connected in this bizarre video produced by a group calling itself Bahrain Wikieaks (which has no connection to the actual WikiLeaks):

According to the Bahrain Independent’s bloggerthe theory that the Alkhawaja family’s work as human rights activists was an American plot is supported by two facts: Mr. Hood and Maryam Alkhawaja both attended Brown University and Mr. Hood greeted a group of protesters that included Zainab Alkhawaja with donuts when they came to the U.S. Embassy in March to express their outrage at the Obama administration’s support for Bahrain’s government. The blogger linked to this video report from Reuters showing the diplomat plying the protesters with donuts:

In his haste to make these connections seem significantthe blogger appears to overlook the fact that Mr. Hood graduated from Brown in 1996when Maryam Alkhawaja was eight years oldso they are unlikely to have been classmates and that it was his job to talk to human rights activists.

As Mr. Gutman explainedby the time Mr. Hood left Bahrain last weekhe had been “the subject of a weeks-long campaign of ethnic slurs and thinly veiled threats on a pro-government Web site and in officially sanctioned newspapers.”

Mr. Gutman noted that “one of the most virulent attacks” came in “an anonymous posting on a pro-government Web site that included links to photos of Hood and his wife on their wedding day and information on where Hood and his family lived.” He added:

The posting claimed that the biggest single supporter of the anti-government protests that began Feb. 14 was the political section of the U.S. embassyworking “in cooperation” with a cell of the Lebanese Hezbollah militant movement. The head of the officethe blog claimedwas “a person of Jewish origin named Ludovic Hood,” and charged: “He’s the one who trained and provoked the demonstrators to clash with the army” near the Pearl Roundabout that was the epicenter of the demonstrations. Hood also was “the one” telling the opposition of the steps they should take “to inflame the situation,” the posting claimed. The blogger called for “honest people to avenge” Hood’s rolegave the neighborhood in which he lived with his family in Manamathe capitaland promised to provide his street address. It linked to a wedding photo of Hood with his “Jewish wife.”

A State Department spokesman told The Lede that Mr. Hood would not be available for comment on his experience in Bahrain but also insisted that his return to Washington was not caused by the campaign of harassment and had been planned 6 months agobefore the protests began.

According to Mr. GutmanMr. Hood returned to the United States earlier than originally planned because of the threats against him and had been given security protection there. The State Department also said in a statement to McClatchy: “It is unacceptable that elements within Bahrain would target an individual for carrying out his professional duties.”

 1491,  2010, a, Introduced on Thursday: 2011 Hyundai Equus

Is it real? After being teased in New York last year in concept formthis full-sizerear-drive luxury sedan will move from Korea to America in 2011giving Hyundai a budget alternative to a Mercedes S-ClassLexus LSJaguar XJ or other top-notch sedans.

What they said: John KrafcickHyundai’s chief executive in North Americasaid Hyundai would be satisfied with selling 3,000 Equus models a year. People with lifelong aspirations to own a Mercedes or BMW may not be interestedbut other affluent people will behe added. “The people we call the ‘strivers’ need and want that luxury badgebut for the millionaire-next-door buyera lot of them got that way by making smart purchases.”

What they didn’t say: Whether people who can spend 90 grand on a show-off sedan really care to announce that they spent less.

What makes it tick: A 4.6-liter V-8 delivers a peak 385 horsepowerjust sneaking past the Mercedes S-Class and Lexus LSthough smallish displacement and a mere 333 pound-feet of torque may pose a challenge against the monsters of this particular midway. But Hyundai did float intriguing plans to lure and pamper customers: Hyundai dealers will pick up Equus models from owners’ homesdrop off a loanerand return the Equus after service; buyers receive a virtual owner’s manual on an Apple iPad that they can also use to schedule service appointments and operate other applications. “Nobody wants to go to the dealershipnot even a Lexus or BMW dealer,” Mr. Krafcik said.

How muchhow soon? Hyunda says the Equus should start at between $50,000-$60,000 and be extremely well-equippedmeaning the Equus would undercut competitors by roughly $12,000 to $35,000.

How does it look? As with other Hyundaisthe Equus checks off everything and more that a buyer would expect at its price. But the over-tall body and Korean home-market styling makes even a Lexus LS look like a Bentley in comparison. Worst casethe Equus becomes the Volkswagen Phaeton redux: An overreaching and already dated-looking sedan that may finally draw the line on how high the Hyundai name can travel in the market. Best caseHyundai scores yet another coup by undercutting its rivals’ bloated prices.

 517,  2016, a, Though Mr. Trump’s campaign announced a new Asian Pacific American Advisory Committee last weeka Republican National Committee spokesmanNinio Fetalvosaid Mr. Trump’s outreach to Asian-American voters had been coordinated until now mainly through two staff members at the party’s Washington headquarters. The partyhe addedhas also printed materials in a variety of Asian languages in cities like Las Vegas.

Republicans’ difficulties with Asian-Americans are similar to those the party has faced with most minority groups. A sense that the party is hostile to immigrants and minorities has driven more Asian-American voters into the Democratic Party latelypolitical scientists and community leaders said. And if Republicans do not make more of an effortthose voting shifts could hardenjust as Hispanics’ voting patterns have.

“What we see now are some early indications that people who either leaned toward the Democratic Party or did not identify with either party are now starting to identify as Democrats,” said Karthick Ramakrishnana professor of political science at the University of CaliforniaRiverside. “This is still a group that is making up its mind,” he added“but it should be concerning to the Republican Party that you’re starting to see this crystallization.”

A national survey in the spring by Asian and Pacific Islander American Votea nonpartisan research groupshowed “a significant leftward shift” since 2012 among Asian-American registered voterswith 47 percent now identifying with the Democratic Partycompared with 35 percent in 2012. Fifteen percent identified as Republican.

In 1992the year national exit polls started reporting Asian-American sentimentthe group leaned Republicansupporting George Bush over Bill Clinton 55 percent to 31 percent. But by 2012that had reversed. Asian-Americans overwhelmingly supported President Obama over Mitt Romney — 73 percent to 26 percentalmost the same margin by which Hispanics favored Mr. Obama.

A Pew Research Center report released last month showed that Asian-Americans have since 2008 embraced the Democratic Party at a faster rate than any other ethnic group.

 6180,  1976, a, ROMEApril 1— The decision taken by the New Jersey Supreme Court in thecontroversial case of Karen Anne Quinlan was‐ criticized today by a professor in an interview on the Vatican radio station. The subject matter of the station's programs cosely reflect Vatican policy.

The court declared yesterday that the mechanical equipment that has been keeping Miss Quinlan alive could be turned off at the discretion of her father if doctors saw no hope for her recovery. The ruling also guaranteed that physicians attending the young woman would be legally protected from being held liable should they grant the parents’ request.

Speaking on the Vatican stationSergio Cottaa professor of the philosophy of law at Rome University. said that the court's decision presented “very dangerous aspects.” The rulinghe saidreflected “an exasperation of the tendency in American courts to uphold the right to privacy as a right to be able to decide anything.”

“From this point of vieweach would become master of his own life,” Professor Cotta added. “One could ‐wishor not wishone's own death whenever one wanted.”
 3645,  1998, a, The investmentwhich would make Travelers the biggest shareholder in Nikkoshows how quickly national borders are breaking down in financial markets: even Japanhistorically a protected market dominated almost exclusively by local brokerage firmsis now eager to embrace Wall Street investment and management.

Under the agreementNikko would join with Salomon's Japanese business to create Nikko Salomon Smith Barney Ltd.a joint ventureinto which Nikko would put its capital markets and international businesses. The new joint venture company's chief executive would be Toshiharu Kojimathe head of Salomon's business in Japanand it would be 51 percent owned by Nikko and 49 percent by Salomonwith each firm contributing six board membersaccording to the executives involved in the negotiations.

But Travelers through its investment in Nikko would be the more powerful partner. It wouldunder the accord to be announced todaybuy 9.5 percent of Nikko's common stockwhich has a current market value of about $540 millionand would also buy Nikko bonds that would be convertible into a further interest of about 15 percent of the brokerage firmto give it about a 25 percent stake in the firm. Nikko is also expected to buy Travelers' shares in the open market to strengthen the link between the two companies.

Both companies declined to make any comment on their pending alliance over the weekend.

The Nikko investment carries big risks for Travelersbut also holds out the prospect of huge rewards if the joint venture works well and Travelers becomes the first American financial company to get extensive access to Japanese investorswho are currently estimated to have about $10 trillion of investments -- mostly invested in bank and savings deposits that yield less than 1 percent a year. Others are racing to try to reach the same goal in other ways; earlier this yearMerrill Lynch & Company bought some of the branches of the recently defunct Yamaichi Securitiesand hired many of its former executives.

The Travelers' movewhich is much larger than the Merrill Lynch investmentalso comes soon after the big Japanese brokerage firms -- NomuraDaiwa and Nikko -- have been found guilty ofand sanctioned forpaying bribes to sokaiyaas Japan's racketeers are known.

Government Secrecy and Bradley Manning

Those who reveal classified material are being punished like never before.

Editors were asked by the C.I.A. to withhold information and did so for months before publishing it online Tuesday night.

Scott Shanea Times national security reporterwas referred to in the government’s prosecution of a former C.I.A. official.

The public editor speaks with Times editors about how they plan to fact-check the first presidential debate.

When opinion appears in news pagesit needs to be labeled and displayed as just that.

Whatever the conclusionswhatever the effectivenessof challenging factsthe idea that we have to debate the necessity of the media doing so strikes me as absurd.

Language and Semantics

 1841,  2008, a, Later this weeka who’s who of the mergers and acquisitions world will troop down to New Orleanswhere Tulane University Law School will be holding its Corporate Law Institute. The eventwhich formally starts Thursdaywill mark the 20th anniversary of an annual gathering that regularly draws the nation’s most prominent deal lawyers.

Flipping through the brochureone is struck by just how much things have changed in the few short months since it was first distributed. But the events of the last year still loom large. Below10 of the burning issues that I hope will be discussed later this week.

1. Is it time to retire the Williams Act? The Williams Act is 40 years old this yearand many of its provisions governing tender offers are outdatedset up for a time before the poison pillwhen companies lacked takeover defenses. For examplegiven the existence of a poison pill and a target’s ability to cap a bidder’s acquisitions of sharesis it even necessary to retain the all-holders/best price rule?

2. Converselywhen will the Securities and Exchange Commission get back in the takeover regulation business? The S.E.C. has been a relatively quiescent regulator of takeovers since its heyday in the 1980sapparently content to let Delaware be the king. The last realsubstantive S.E.C. review of merger regulation was back in 1983. (Marty Lipton was on that panel also.) This has left us with a federal takeover code that is outdated — see point 1 — and sometimes makes little sense. For exampleis there any reason to not put mergers and tender offers on full parity? And why is it that the Delaware courts now appear to be the primary regulators of fairness opinion disclosure? It would be nice if the S.E.C. could at least fix these issues and harmonize its regulation with the last twenty years of Delaware’s decisions.

3. Are special-purpose acquisition companies a boon — or the next calamity waiting to happen? In particular — and since this is a takeover conference — I’m interested in the issues that are likely to arise in the coming wave of SPAC takeovers. Will significant SPAC shareholders attempt to hold up acquisitions and extort additional consideration by their ability to vote no on acquisitions and force a liquidation of the vehicle? What happens when the trading price of a SPAC is actually below the liquidation value in such circumstances? And who is still buying these things anyway?

4.What is the likely future structure of private equity transactions? Are we going to see a continuedwholesale shift to single-tier reverse termination fee deals with no possibility of specific performance? This appears to be the trend right nowbut what will happen once the market perks up again and strategic bidders compete for deals? In this regardit would be nice to get some comment from the Delaware judges on what they think about the availability of specific performance in a cash deal under Delaware law in the face of party language to that effect.

5. When will the S.E.C. finally reform its cross-border rules? Eight years after their promulgationthe S.E.C. exemptions for cross-border transactions are still unworkable.

6. What should we do about sovereign wealth funds? This was the hot-button issue three issues backbefore Bear Stearns; the Clear Channel litigation and its implications for bank-sponsor lending relationships; and the possible restructuring of the financial regulatory framework. But the question remains: Is more regulation of sovereign wealth funds a necessity or an economic burden? And does Treasury’s recent one-page voluntary statement of principles with Dubai and Singapore on these funds mean anything at all? The background issue here is whether the national security review process is currently effective and not overburdensome in light ofinter aliaCFIUS’s blocking of the 3Com transaction. Or perhaps it is not strict enough and should apply to noncontrolling transactionssuch as the recent slew of investment bank sovereign wealth investments.

7. Are hedge funds the future of mergers? As hedge funds become increasingly activist investorshow will they affect the structuring and completion of takeovers? Are the cries of short-termism correct — or even relevant?

8. Do we need to rethink the terms of debt financing arrangements? Given the blow-up in the Clear Channel litigationshould sponsors and other borrowers firm up terms in financing commitment letters and fill the uncertainty over what the “customary” language requirement means? Is Clear Channel an abnormality or is there indeed a need for a rethink of financing language? And how about that solvency language which bit Genesco so hard?

9. Is the Bear Stearns deal valid under Delaware law? Will it spell the end of the holding in Omnicare? Her,e I include that uncapped top-up option that went by the wayside in the renegotiated deal. And where is Joe Lewis these daysanyway?

10. Who do you love more: the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the S.E.C.? In other wordsdiscuss the Paulson proposal and its chances for success.

I’ll also be there at Tulane. I’m hoping to find answers to these and other takeover questions. If you do happen to be attendingfeel free to say hi. I’ll be the guy selling do-it-yourself SPAC kits. –Steven M. Davidoff

 3261,  2000, a, The United Nations Drug Control Program says in a report made public today that Afghanistan is now not only the largest producer of opium but is also becoming a major manufacturer of heroinwhich is contributing to a rise in addiction throughout the region.

The reportprepared for a meeting here on Monday of Afghanistan's six neighbors plus the United States and Russiasays that Pakistan and Iran now have some of the world's highest rates of addiction to heroinwhich is derived from opium. ''Central Asian countries show alarming signs of fast-increasing abuse rates,'' it says.

Afghanistan is encircled by PakistanIranTurkmenistanUzbekistanTajikistan and a far-western corridor of China.

''The number of heroin addicts in the region exceeds that of Western Europe and is still on the increase,'' says the reportprepared by Pino Arlacchiexecutive director of the United Nations office for drug control and crime prevention. The report adds that communities of addicts in the region are seen as easy targets for organized crime and vectors for the spread of AIDS.
 4316,  1994, a, Perhaps familiar surroundings and a towel-wavingfrenzied crowd at the Garden will help snap the Knicks out of their funk. But by losing Games 3 and 4the Knicks have magnified the importance of Game 5. The winner will be one victory away from the finals. The loser will be one loss away from vacation.

"We respect the fact that we have the home courtbut we also respect the fact that there are no guarantees," said Pat Rileyafter a short practice session yesterday. "Home court will not guarantee anything. Players have to guarantee with a great effort. So that's what we're going to have to have."

More baskets would not hurt the Knicks' cause either. No teamnot even the Chicago Bullshave made the Knicks' offense look as bad in the playoffs as the Pacers made it look in the third and fourth games. The Knicks were pathetic in Game 3 when they scored 68 pointsa record low for the National Basketball Association playoffs since the advent of the 24-second clock. They were merely terrible in Game 4 when they produced 77 points in an 83-77 loss. Right Kind of Players

Why has Indiana been able to shut down the Knicks so thoroughly? The Pacers have a superb game plan and the players to execute it. They have have a tallphysical front line that matches up well with New York's frontcourt. Rik Smits has a 4-inch height advantage over Patrick Ewingenabling him to alter Ewing's shot more often than most centers. Smits's backupAntonio Davishas the strength to push Ewing away from his favorite low-post spots.

Dale DavisAntonio Davis and Smits have kept Charles OakleyAnthony Mason and Ewing from dominating the glass. And Derrick McKey's defense has helped keep Charles Smith from reaching double figures in any game yet. To winthe Knicks simply must have more scoring from their small forwardwhether he be Smith or Mason. And when fast-break opportunities arisethe Knicks must react quickly.

 4949,  1990, a, The Merrill Lynch Asset-Backed Corporation 1990-1 yesterday priced $622 million in debt securities due in 1995 that are backed by Chrysler Credit Corporation car loans.

The offering is being handled through Merrill Lynch Capital Markets as sole manager. Underwriters said the 9 3/4 percent securities were priced at 99 24/32 to yield 9.22 percentor about 75 basis points more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity.

 1109,  2012, a, In the last 24 hoursthousands of women turned to Twitter and Facebook to express their anger over the decision by the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundationthe world’s largest breast cancer organizationto halt financial support for cancer screening and education services at Planned Parenthood affiliates.

Planned Parenthoodas my colleague Pam Belluck reportedaccused Komen of bowing to pressure from anti-abortion rights activistsprompting a passionate online discussion from both sides of the abortion debateas well as thousands of online messages lamenting the role of politics in women’s health care.

Beyond politicians and advocatessome authorsincluding Judy Blume and celebritiesincluding actress Dana Delaney jumped into the conversation on Twitter.

On WednesdaySusan G. Komen was a top Google search termfalling just below Don Corneliusthe creator of “Soul Train,” after news of his death was announced. It was also a top trending topic in the U.S. on Twitter. And more than 5,000 people left comments on a post that Komen made on its Facebook page defending its decisionwhich the foundation said was not made in response to pressure from opponents of abortion rights.

On the Red State blogErik Erikson applauded Komen’s decision and urged people to send a thank you note and a donation to the organization.

Groupsincluding Americans United for Lifealso urged people to show their support for the Komen Foundation on Facebook.

While there were comments on FacebookTwitter and online message boards praising Komenan analysis by Polipulsea social media analytics tool for a Washington-based public relations firm showed that 75 percent of the people posting on social media channels about the decision were sharing negative comments about Komen’s decison while 25 percent supported it. According to the analysismore than 20 percent said that they would not give money to Komen because of the move.

Some people called on their Facebook friends and Twitter followers to turn in their pink ribbons and offer financial support to Planned Parenthood instead of Susan G. Komen. An online letter was shared by more than 19,000 people. By Wednesday afternoonPlanned Parenthood was advertising on Twitter using promoted tweets to help raise money.

Please RT: Help us make sure that women continue to get the care they need. Donate to Planned Parenthood today: bit.ly/AAlipY #komen — Planned Parenthood (@PPact) February 12012

Raising money onlinealonegenerated $400,000 by Wednesday eveningin addition to a $250,000 donation from a Dallas-based organization.

In an article by Gardiner Harris and Pam Belluck about the Komen foundationa board member said that Planned Parenthood exploiting the news as a fund-raising opportunity.

Some of the online discussion centered on Karen Handelthe Komen foundation’s senior vice president for public policy since April 2011who ran on an anti-abortion rights platform during an unsuccessful bid for governor of Georgia in 2010. The blogJezebelfound a post on Ms. Handel’s campaign blog stating that she did not support the mission of Planned Parenthood.

And both organizations used social media throughout the day to communicate their positionincluding a Komen organization in Connecticut that announced on its Facebook page its frustration with the decision to cut funds for Planned Parenthood.

 3464,  1999, a, Sergeant Stonewho received the reading material todaysaid he had only briefly ''caught sight'' of his fellow G.I.'s during his captivity.

Specialist Gonzaleswho appeared more rested than the othersgave the most elaborate description of his condition. Responding to a question from Mr. Jacksonhe said he was ''okayconsidering the circumstances.'' He added that he is also feeling ''a little mentally drained.''

Mr. Jackson told him: ''You are a hero. People know you all over the world.''

In WashingtonDavid Leavyspokesman for the National Security Councilreacted to the interview by praising Mr. Jacksonbut then adding: ''We opposed his mission because we felt we couldn't protect his safetyand feared it would be misconstrued in Belgrade. It is positive that he was able to see the three soldiersdeliver messages from familes and verify their health. But there is no basis for their being taken and we continue to hold Mr. Milosevic responsible for their personal safety.''

A group of American ChristianJewish and Muslim leaderssome of whom had met with the soldiers' familiescame from the United States with Mr. Jacksonbut were barred by the Yugoslav authorities from meeting with them. They brought Bibles and small Eastern Orthodox icons for each manas well as five packages of Chuckles candies for Sergeant Ramireza tape player and cassette tapes recorded by each of the men's families.

Mr. Jackson showed each of the soldiers the giftsbut the Yugoslav generalwho would not identify himselfdid not allow the soldiers to take the giftssaying they had to pass military censors first.

To each of the servicementhoughMr. Jackson offered words of encouragement.

''So many view the jail experience as a time of reflectiona time to writea time to thinka time to praya time to think about how they want to build their lives,'' he told Sergeant Stoneadding that his imprisonment could be an opportunity to strengthen his character and faith.

''Out of our scars,'' he said''come our stars.''

 3290,  2000, a, In the new church of American financethe first article of faith is progress. More and more goods and services will be produced with fewer and fewer hours of laborworld without end.

Evidence in support of this belief would appear to be conclusive. Firstthere is the revolution in computer technology. Secondthere seems to be official affirmation in the national productivity statistics.

To compute these statisticsthe Labor Department divides the volume of our national economic output by the hours worked to create it. In the third and fourth quarters of 1999the productivity of American nonfarm labor rose at annual rates of 5 percent and 6.4 percentthe fastest in years. Expectations are running strong that the next productivity reportto be released on Thursdaywill be just as brilliant.

It will be a miracle if it is. If the strength of the recent productivity reports seems unbelievableit is perhaps because they are. James Medoffa Harvard economics professorand Andrew Harlessan economic consultant in NeedhamMass.have uncovered deep-rooted flaws in the data. Their conclusion is that the numbers were distorted in the melee associated with the run-up to the year 2000. If they are rightas it seems apparent they arethe ''New Economy'' is about to lose some of its luster.
 1423,  2011, a, David Goldman for The New York Times

When Jon S. Corzine joined MF Global last year it seemed like a strange choice — the firm had none of the glamourlet alone the profits or footprint of Goldman Sachsthe bank he ran during the 1990s.

On Wall Streetit was as if a manager of the New York Yankees was making a comeback in the minor leagues.

Mr. Corzine64who not only presided over Goldman but later served in the United States Senate and then as governor of New Jerseyseemed surprised himself.

“Don’t ask me any hard questions,” he joked to a visitor who met with him just days after Mr. Corzine took over in March 2010. “I hadn’t heard of this company a week ago.”

Nownearly everyone has.

MF Globala commodities and derivatives brokerage housecollapsed on Monday in the biggest bankruptcy on Wall Street since the failure of Lehman Brothers. The firm imploded after a big investment in European bonds — a bet he directed and defended as not particularly risky as recently as last week — led investorsclients and ratings agencies to lose confidence in the firm.

The fall of MF Globaland the discovery that hundreds of millions of dollars were missing from the firm’s customer accountshave now cast a dark cloud over Mr. Corzine’s legacy and reputation. Federal authorities have stepped up an inquiry into why the firm failed to keep its customers’ money separate from the company’s — a regulatory violation.

MF Global was supposed to be Mr. Corzine’s comeback vehicle after New Jersey voters turned him out in 2009. Insteadthe collapse of the firm appears to be a humiliating coda to the career of a one-time titan of Wall Street.

His insistence on taking more risksincluding buying the debt of European countries like Italy and Spainalong with a contract that would have provided him with an additional $12.1 million if he left the firmpaint a picture of excess.

And Mr. Corzinewith a fortune estimated at half a billion dollars at its peakdid not confine his future ambitions to Wall Street. Even as he was seeking to revive his financial careerMr. Corzinea Democrathad long styled himself as a financial executive moving seamlessly between Washington and Wall Streetin the mold of former Treasury secretaries like Robert E. Rubin or C. Douglas Dillon.

With MF Global’s bankruptcythat goal seems forever out of reach. It has also taken a big toll on a man known for the kind of optimism that comes naturally to experienced traders and political leaders.

Six weeks agoMr. Corzine journeyed a few blocks from the firm’s Midtown Manhattan office to the Hilton Hotel for a routine presentation to money managers. Mr. Corzine’s manner was anything but routinehowever.

“He looked like he had just seen a ghost,” said one participant. “He looked visibly disturbed.”

Mr. Corzine could not be reached for comment.

Friends say this is one more humiliation in a career marked by painful public ousterswhether it was from the executive suite at Goldman or from Drumthwacketthe New Jersey governor’s mansion.

“That’s part of the tragedy here,” said Robert G. Torricellithe former Democratic senator from New Jersey whose political career was also cut short. “Jon is very proud and this must be exceedingly difficult. You can lose an election and not take it as personally because it’s a reflection on issues and trends. But this is obviously different: all eyes are on him. It’s one thing to make financial misjudgments and to pay the price yourself. But it’s another when institutions are damaged.”

Mr. Corzine’s arrival seemed like a coup for MF Global when it hired him as chief executive. MF Global has been a leading player in brokering trades in commodities and derivatives like futures contracts.

But MF Global had the potential to be more than a brokerage firmMr. Corzine thought. When he was at Goldmanthat firm had bought a commodities trader in 1981J. Aron & Companywhich was encouraged to take more risks and became a huge success.

Mr. Corzine replaced old-line traders and brokers with more aggressive hires from Goldman SachsUBS and Soros Fund Management.

In May 2010in his first investor call as chief executive of MF GlobalMr. Corzine discussed what could go wrong at the brokerage firm as it ratcheted up risk. “It will be mistaken judgments,” he said“that go beyond limitswhich I don’t intend to allow happen.”

Yet despite his confidence in risk managementMr. Corzine’s message to traders was clear: Take more risks. “He was instrumental in pushing our firm forward with risk taking in every bookwhether it was U.S. government bondscurrenciesor in repos,” said one trader. “Everything was full throttle go.”

European sovereign debt looked especially tempting. Instead of the near-zero yields on United States Treasury bondsshort to medium Italian and Spanish bonds were earning 2 to 3 percent. Simply holding those to maturity and collecting the yields would buttress profits as other businesses shrank.

And while most Wall Street firms sharply ratcheted down their use of leverageMF Global continued to pile on large amounts of debt. On the eve of its collapseit had about $34 of debt for each $1 of capital it heldaccording to data from KeefeBruyette & Woods. By contrastGoldman Sachs’ leverage ratio is $13.50 for every $1.

The combination of potential losses on the European debt and the MF Global’s thin capital cushion is what spooked investorssetting off the crisis. MF Global’s demise was the eighth largest bankruptcy in the country’s historybut with $41 billion in assets it was considerably smaller than Lehman which had assets of $691 billion.

For those who have followed Mr. Corzine’s careerhoweverthe problems at MF Global have elicited a strong sense of déjà vu.

In 1994Mr. Corzine ascended to the top of Goldman Sachs despite hundreds of millions of dollars in trading losses at the bank’s bond unitwhich he had overseen. He assumed leadership of Goldmansay his former colleaguesin part because he was one of the few partners who understood how to extricate the bank from its soured trades.

Mr. Corzinea lifelong trader with a large appetite for riskrecently reflected on his past experiences dealing with crises in William D. Cohan’s book “Money and PowerHow Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the World,” a recent history of the bank.

“Until you’ve actually traded and had to deal with one of those come-to-Jesus moments with a bad position,” he said“and you have to make the decisions about whether to eliminate ithold itreduce it — those kind of existential moments involving the people you work with and your firmthose are the kinds of things that really get your attention.”

Mr. Corzine’s worldview had been forged at Goldmanwhere he spent 24 years. After growing up in a farm town in Illinoiswhere he was captain of his high school basketball teamMr. Corzinearmed with an M.B.A. from the University of Chicagojoined Goldman Sachs in 1975 as a bond trader. Bond trading was then low on the totem pole of Goldman. But he gained notice making big bets — and generating big profits — trading government bonds. At the age of 33he made partner.

As Goldman’s senior partner from 1994 to 1999he led the bank through the Asian financial crisis and the collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund. His crowning achievement was Goldman’s initial public offering in 1999though the controversial move led to a power struggle that ultimately cost him his job.

In 1998he also drew the ire of his Goldman partners for discussing a merger with Mellon Bank without conferring with the firm’s management committeea misstep that also contributed to his being replaced by Henry M. Paulson Jr.who later became secretary of the Treasury under President George W. Bush.

Upon leaving GoldmanMr. Corzine turned his attention to public servicespending a sizable chunk of his fortune — more than $100 million — to pursue political office.

After being elected to the Senate as a Democrat from New Jersey in 2000Mr. Corzine distinguished himself in Washington for his financial acumen. But he viewed himself as more of an executive than a legislatorand decided to run for governor in 2005 before completing his term.

Mr. Corzine’s one term as governor was marked by difficulties. He complicated his run for governor by divorcing his wife of more than 34 years shortly before announcing his candidacy and was dogged throughout his time in office by complaints that his romantic relationship with a leader of state employees’ union left him in an untenable conflict of interest.

His first year in officehe presided over a weeklong government shutdown when the legislature originally balked at his proposal to increase the sales tax. The next yearhe was badly injured in a car accident when his speeding state vehicle crashed. Mr. Corzinea passenger who was not wearing a seat beltendured months of difficult rehabilitation that aides and critics said drastically affected the rest of his term.

Working at MF GlobalMr. Corzine’s life has revolved around Manhattan; he is rarely seen in Hobokenwhere he keeps an apartment. Last year he married Sharon Elghanayanthe former wife of K. Thomas Elghanayana New York real estate developer.

National politics remained a focus of Mr. Corzine after he joined MF Global. He pitched in to help raise money for President Obama — who had campaigned for Mr. Corzine during his re-election bid for governor.

Mr. Obama’s first major re-election fund-raiser in New York was held at the Manhattan home of Mr. Corzine’s wifewith tickets going for $35,800 each. And Mr. Corzine was one of the president’s most elite bundlerssupporters who tap friends and business associates to bring in checks: He has helped Mr. Obama raise more than $500,000 this year.

When White House officials sought to broker a meeting between disgruntled Wall Street executives and Mr. Obama’s new chief of staff this yearthey turned to Mr. Corzinewho organized a sit-down at the Four Seasons. Mr. Corzine was on the list. There had even been talk of his being named the next Treasury secretary.

Nowinstead of a big job in WashingtonMr. Corzine faces difficult questions about what happened on his watch and whether he should have returned to Wall Street at all.

“He wanted to be back in the game,” said one old friend. “He thought he could make it work.”

 4454,  1993, a, To the Editor:

Your description of child care on the night shift (front pageMarch 14) is one more example of the lengths parents are forced to go to in order to support their families.

The Toyota Center is certainly a better alternative than many parents have. Without itthe workers you describe would be forced to quit their jobsleave their children home alone or patch together a series of arrangementswith the constant worry over whether or not their children are safe and well cared for.

Shift work doesn't put undue stress only on children. Shift workers experience higher rates of on-the-job injuries and stress-related illnesses. It's time to look for ways to strike a better balance. In many European countriesround-the-clock production is restricted to industries that require continuous operationssuch as oil refining and chemical production.

Rather than continue to organize work as we have always doneand simply add child-care centers to the benefitslet's ask whether or not there's a bettermore family-friendly way to protect production and families at the same time. At leastovertime should be voluntaryand parents who can't work the night shift should be able to bid for day jobs that open up.

 4445,  1993, a, Trade Center tenants hustled yesterday to find alternative spacesand by last night it was apparent that in spite of the bombmany would be back in business today.

For some companieslike Fuji Bank Ltd.the task of setting up for today was under way before employees vacated their trade center space Friday. Katsuma Oharageneral manager of the financial company's Americas divisionsaid 150 of the 450 people in the trade center operation would be in a computer center in North BergenN.J. where the Fuji Bank had previously arranged for backup space. The rest would be in branch offices in Manhattan.

Workers at other companies will be moving in with colleagues and clients. Still other trade center companies will dispatch workers to their other nearby locations.

If there is one venue that is best suited for multiple winnersit is the spelling bee. Both onstage and offstagespelling kids high-five one anothershare study techniques and root for others once they have fallen. They realize that they are not competing against the other participants but against the word lists.

I have met with scores of familiesattended multiple spelling competitions and visited the homes of competitive spellers. These are happyenergeticcommitted children. The notion that they are forced into this by their parents is a myth. Studying can be a chorebut committed spellers put in hours a dayeven in the “off-season” of the summer and fallbecause they like it and are motivated. Moreoverit is a social affairwith parents and siblings helping out and dedicating time. Young people study in groups online.

This is not to suggest that Scripps should encourage eight co-champions again. But the most obvious fix — to make the words even harder — is a mistake. Scripps has already tried to weed out co-championsand seems to now be pulling words from the back pages of Merriam-Webster’s unabridged dictionary. Gradual increases in word difficulty are to be expectedbut nothing more.

Contestants already spend an inordinate amount of time studying the dictionary. They enjoy much of the processbut it consumes enough of their timeeffort and money. I have sat with parents as they quiz their children on German root wordsbreak for lunchand then continue for hours. Families create their own word lists based on their appraisal of likely words. They purchase word lists. They read through books of nothing but prefixes. They hire coaches.

 5227,  1988, a, Under the new Delaware lawa hostile bidder that acquires more than 15 percent of a target's stock cannot complete a takeover for three years. But the law allows the bidder to consummate the deal immediately ifin crossing the 15 percent thresholdit acquires in one fell swoop more than 85 percent of the outstanding stock. 2 New Bidders Affected This provision could make it significantly more difficult for the Campeau Corporation to succeed in its $4.2 billion hostile bid for Federated Department Stores Inc. and for the Black & Decker Corporation to execute its $1.8 billion unsolicited offer for American Standard Inc. Both Federated and American Standard are incorporated in the stateand Campeau has indicated it will challenge the validity of the new law in court.

The new lawwhich will become Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Lawwill also permit shareholders to approve an unfriendly merger over the objections of management. Two-thirds of the shares votingexcluding shares held by the bidderwould have to consent in a special election.

The law is retroactive to last Dec. 23. Governor Castle said in an interview Friday that the date was picked by the Legislature to accommodate Texaco Inc.which has been embroiled in a struggle with its largest shareholderCarl C. Icahn. Texaco is incorporated in Delaware and also has a major plant there.

On Dec. 23 Mr. Icahn held less than 15 percent of Texaco and executives feared he might bid for the companyespecially if he succeeded in removing the anti-takeover provisions of Texaco's bylaws. But a Federal Bankruptcy Court last month dismissed his attempts at dismantling those provisionsand on Thursday Mr. Icahn said he controlled 14.8 percent of the outstanding stock. Aims of the Law

Governor Castle said the law was intended ''to curb leveraged financing and those abusive deals that result in the breakup of companies.''

''Companies and takeover artists have to learn that they have a certain responsibility to the community,'' he added.

Delaware has profited handsomely from its role as a major state for incorporations. Last year it derived about $156 millionor 16 percent of its revenuefrom franchise taxes and fees associated with incorporation.

 5198,  1989, a, Scientists have found a deficiency of a substance that is important to the normal functioning of cells in a small study of people infected with the AIDS virus.

The finding raises the question whether a deficiency of the substanceglutathioneleads to the collapse of the immune system that characterizes AIDSscientists from the National Institutes of Health said in a report being published today in the British journal Lancet.

The study involved 14 men who were infected with the AIDS virus but had no symptoms and 19 men who were not infected. The amount of glutathione was reduced by up to one-half the usual levels in the men infected with the AIDS virus.

''We don't know how important the finding is,'' Dr. Ronald G. Crystalone of the authorssaid in an interview.
 657,  2015, a, Google continued to apologize Wednesday for a flaw in Google Photoswhich was released to great fanfare in Maythat led the new application to mistakenly label photos of black people as “gorillas.”

The company said it had fixed the problem and was working to figure out exactly how it happened.

“We’re appalled and genuinely sorry that this happened,” said a Google representative in an emailed statement. “We are taking immediate action to prevent this type of result from appearing.”

From self-driving cars to photosGooglelike every technology companyis constantly releasing cutting-edge technologies with the understanding that problems will arise and that it will have to fix them as it goes. The idea is that you never know what problems might arise until you get the technologies in the hands of real-world users.

In the case of the Google Photos app — which uses a combination of advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to help users collectsearch and categorize photos — errors are easy to spot. When the app was unveiled at the company’s annual developer showexecutives went through carefully staged demonstrations to show how it can recognize landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and give users the ability to search their photos for peopleplaces or things — even things as specific as a particular dog breed.

Of coursein practiceit is much messier. Google Photos mistakes dogs for horses and clocks for hubcaps. In my Google Photosa picture of a friend’s bloody elbowinjured while skateboardingwas labeled “food.”

But some mistakes are bigger than othersand on Sunday a Brooklyn software developer named Jacky Alcinéwho is blackused Twitter to post an image that showed his Google Photos app had labeled a picture of Mr. Alciné and a friend as “gorillas.” In an interviewhe said he figured posting on Twitter would lead to a much quicker fix.

“Using a livestream (like Twitter) as opposed to waiting for a response is a lot more efficient,” he said.

This proved correct. Within an hour and a halfa Google engineer named Yonatan Zungerwhose title is chief architect in the Google Plus social networkresponded to his postand promised swift action.

That action includes temporarily removing nearly everything having to do with gorillasincluding the ability to search for gorillas and the entire gorillas label.

“There is still clearly a lot of work to do with automatic image labelingand we’re looking at how we can prevent these types of mistakes from happening in the future,” added the Google representative.

 271,  2018, a, SÃO PAULOBrazil — For Natalia and Rubens Ortegathe only remaining question is: Glock or Taurus?

The young couple signed up for a gun-training course at a shooting club in São Paulo just days after Jair Bolsonaroa far-right former Army captainwas elected Brazil’s next president on the strength of his promise to upend the status quo and combat crime.

For a population angered by the last few years of political and economic turmoil and worried by escalating violenceMr. Bolsonaro’s vow to break with Brazil’s restrictive attitude toward weapons and make it easier for “good guys” to own guns was particularly resonant.

“We want to get back in practice so we can buy a pistol when it happens,” said Mr. Ortegawho has joined a wave of Brazilians preparing for a widely expected relaxing of gun restrictions. “We just can’t decide which one.”

Mr. Bolsonaro’s tough-on-crime stance helped catapult him to the head of a splintered race in a country reeling from a record-level epidemic of violence. Last year there were roughly 175 homicides per day in Brazilaccording to the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety. Often simulating gunfire with his fingers at campaign ralliesMr. Bolsonaro said he would combat the homicide epidemic by easing firearm laws and giving the police more freedom to shoot suspects.

 5168,  1989, a, Clearlymost citizens and their political leaders continue to impute powers to nuclear weapons well beyond their vast destructive potential. American and Soviet officials now visit once-secret military installationsbut nuclear weapons continue to be treated with special deferenceas if these state secrets were among the most sacred held by powerful societies. More than any other observerRobert Jervisa professor of political science at Columbia Universityhas explored the symbolic and psychological aspects of nuclear strategy. ''The Meaning of the Nuclear Revolution,'' a collection of new and revised essaysdemonstrates the utility of connecting nuclear theology to social psychology and history.

Mr. Jervis's thesis is that nuclear weapons have unalterably changed the way people think and the way nations behave. Given these weapons of mass destructionhe arguesvictory is no longer possible in superpower confrontationsand large-scale violence is no longer a useful tool of statecraft: ''It is the prospect of fighting the war rather than the possibility of losing it that induces restraint.'' In Mr. Jervis's viewthis basic psychological conditionrather than highly diversified nuclear optionsconstitutes the essence of deterrence.

Because of the horrendous consequences of any nuclear confrontationMr. Jervis believes these weapons have not only made war less likelythey have also made major crises between great powers an infrequent occurrence. Aside from the nerve-racking period between 1958 and 1962when the superpowers engaged in high-stakes confrontations over Berlin and CubaAmerican and Russian leaders have acted with considerable restraint. Significantlythe last such confrontation happened 16 years agoduring the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. An intriguing question Mr. Jervis does not address here is the degree to which the personalities of American and Soviet leaders have contributed to nuclear crises.

Since nuclear weapons promote cautionMr. Jervis contendsthey have served to reinforce the status quoespecially in terms of alliance relations. Recent controversies within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization over nuclear modernization seem to argue otherwisebut Mr. Jervis argues convincingly that superpower nuclear arsenals have provided more glue than solvent to alliance relationships. Historicallymajor shifts in territory and spheres of influence usually occur through conflict or through threats of warand nuclear weapons have reduced both. These weapons also place a heavy onus on the superpower that wishes to change the status quo. When full-blown crises have erupted or when the superpowers have jockeyed for advantage over lesser stakesMr. Jervis concludespolitical outcomes have been unrelated to the nuclear balance or perceptions of it.

This book is a testament to changing nuclear fashions. The ''victory is possible'' school of strategic analysiswhich appears to have prompted several of these essayshas been quieted by the surprising developments of the past three years. Now that Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev have jointly declared that a nuclear war must never be fought and can never be wonmost of Mr. Jervis's conclusions will not provoke a spirited argument. Insteada new set of questions has risen to the fore that the author does not address. What are the psychological and strategic implications when one of the superpowers systematically attempts to devalue nuclear weaponsas the Kremlin is now doing? How does ''the absence of peaceful change on issues of most concern to the superpowers'' - one hallmark of Mr. Jervis's nuclear revolution - square with events now unfolding in the Warsaw Pact nations? And how do Mr. Jervis's findings relate to states that are not superpowers?

'THE NUTCRACKER,' A TIRED GIMMICK

Visions of sugarplum fairies will continue to dance in our heads through Tchaikovsky's glorious score for ''The Nutcracker.'' The music will endurebut as a ballet''The Nutcracker'' is approaching self-destruction.

Although the first staging dates from 1892the ''Nutcracker'' craze began with George Balanchine's 1954 production for the New York City Ballet. A shrewd mix of spectacle and romantic plot (a child's dream journey into a candy kingdom) has been turned by dance troupes throughout the land into a box-office gimmick.

The truth is that ''The Nutcracker,'' slim on classical dancingis not the ideal introduction to ballet. Hence the urge to tinker and the spate of revisionist versions: Drosselmeierthe little heroine's godfatheris now likely to be a child molester. At some pointwe will prefer an ice show from that other magic kingdom. ANNA KISSELGOFF

 5000,  1990, a, Washington's relations with Israel have been relatively smooth during the gulf crisisAmerican and Israeli officials say. Israel has been responsive to American requests that it not become directly involved in the conflictor take any pre-emptive action against Iraq. Washingtonin turnmade clear that it was willing to consider added military aid to Israel.

The crisis has deflected attention from the impasse that had been developing between the Administration and Jerusalem over the Israeli Government's reluctance to open a dialogue with the Palestinians on the basis of a compromise formula proposed last spring by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d.

To bolster Saudi Arabia against a possible attack from Iraqthe Administration announced this week that it would make an emergency sale of $2.2 billion worth of weapons to Riyadhincluding 24 F-15 fighter planes150 M-60 tanks and 200 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. In additionPentagon officials said the United States would probably sell the Saudis another 24 F-15's early next year.

''The White House and State Department called to say they recognized an imbalance was occurring and that some form of additional weaponry for Israel would be found to remedy that,'' said Senator Rudy BoschwitzRepublican of Minnesota.

'Shifting Alliances'

One leader of an American Jewish groupspeaking on the condition of anonymitysaid: ''Arms to the Saudis pose a real dilemma for the Jewish community. On the one hand Saudi Arabia has legitimate defense needs right now. But this latest package constitutes a clear threat to Israel in the long run. No one knows what will happen to Saudi Arabia in the future. Middle East politics is made up of shifting alliances.''

Several hurdles must still be cleared to complete the proposed arms deal. One problem is matching the list of weapons that Israel wants with what the United States can afford to give up.

Soviet Talks May Free Tanks

The Pentagonfor exampleexpects to have surplus M-60 tanks once arms control talks with the Soviet Union are concluded. The available tankshoweverare an older version of the model the Israelis would likeand would not be available for several months.

 1421,  2011, a, After a string of smaller deals in the oil patch over the last two yearsKohlberg Kravis Roberts is gearing up for a potential blockbuster takeover.

The private equity giant is in exclusive talks to buy some or all of the Samson Investment Companya family-owned oil and natural gas exploration companyaccording to a person briefed on the matter.

K.K.R. has been studying a possible Samson transaction for some time and has been lining up financing with several banksthis person addedcautioning that the talks could still fall apart.

Should the two sides reach a dealit would be one of the largest leveraged buyouts since the financial crisis of September 2008. K.K.R. can already lay claim to one of the priciest private equity deals in the last yearhaving led the purchase of Del Monte Foods for $5.3 billion.

Samson currently runs more than 4,000 wells and has at least partial ownership of more than 11,000 wells across the countryaccording to its Web site.

Among its businesses is drilling for oil and natural gas in shale formationsan increasingly popular tactic that has driven a wave of takeovers in the energy industry.

A deal would bring to a close the Schusterman family’s 40-year control of Samsonwhich has become a respectable oil exploration player that is still based in TulsaOkla. The company’s current chairwoman and chief executive is Stacy Schustermandaughter of the founderCharles Schusterman.

Ms. Schusterman acknowledged the company’s discussions with K.K.R. in an internal memorandum obtained by The Tulsa World:

“If a definitive agreement is reached with K.K.R.it will be because they recognize both the value of our assets and our team,” Ms. Shusterman said in the statement. “K.K.R. has stated that if we move forwardthey are committed to building our team at each of our current locations.”

A K.K.R. spokeswoman declined to comment.

News of K.K.R.’s talks with Samson was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.

As word spread about controversial remarks by the state ComptrollerAlan G. Hevesihis Republican opponentJ. Christopher Callaghanstood happily under the media spotlight talking about flub.

Mr. Hevesi created a stir by talking of Senator Charles E. Schumer “putting a bullet between the President’s eyes.’’

Mr. Callaghan wasted no time jumping into the fray. “What could he have been thinking?,” he said of the threats. “I think it’s horrid judgement.” He addedwithout too much bluster: “How can a statewide official say that?”

When one reporter asked if Mr. Hevesi needed “psychological evaluation,” Mr. Callaghan demurred.

“I’ll let you make up your own quotes,” he said.

 4866,  1991, a, Pentagon aid to the Soviet Union would be separate from and in addition to other public and private American assistance currently under considerationincluding increased agricultural loan guarantees and direct food aid this winter. The total amount of proposed Pentagon aid has not been determinedthe officials said.

When the idea was first suggested by Mr. Aspin in August after the unsuccessful hard-line coup in MoscowDefense Secretary Dick Cheney dismissed it as "foolish" and "a serious mistake" that could damage United States security.

Under gentle prodding from the White HousethoughMr. Cheney is now ready to relent on the condition that the Pentagon has authority to make the necessary budget cuts and to decide how the money will be spent on the SovietsAdministration officials said.

The Soviet aid package is the brainchild of the two influential leaders of the Armed Services CommitteesMr. Aspin and Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia. For the last several weeksthe two men have worked with their staffs and quietly with key Administration officials to draft a proposal acceptable to Congress and the Pentagon.

The lawmakers are putting the finishing touches on the planwhich is included in the military budget bill that House and Senate negotiators are expected to complete in the next few days.

The full House and Senate are expected to approve the compromise billwhich then goes to President Bush. Administration officials said the plan would not violate last year's budget agreement because the Soviet aid would come out of the Pentagon's budget. No Pentagon money could be devoted to domestic programs this year without reopening the budget agreementa very unlikely possibility.

Lawmakers have suggested that the Pentagon consider a number of steps to assist the Soviet Unionincluding using Air Force planes to transport food and medical aid to the Soviet people this winter and to provide other help in distributing the aid.

 612,  2015, a, SIOUX CITYIowa – The more than 100 people who showed up for a town-hall-style event at Morningside College here on Wednesday heard Senator’s Ted Cruz’s thoughts on the battle over a law in Indiana billed as a religious freedom measure.

“We’re seeing in the news right now a lot of noise because the state of Indiana bravely stood up and passed a law defending religious liberty,” Mr. Cruz said in his opening remarks. “And I say this: I will commend the state of Indiana for doing the right thing.”

It seemed Mr. Cruza Texas Republicanhad touched a nerveas he was greeted with nods of approval and occasional applause. Indeedwestern Iowawhere Morningside isis one of the most conservative parts of the statehome to the evangelical population that has propped up candidates like Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee in the past.

Three of the five questions that followed Mr. Cruz’s remarks were on religious liberty and same-sex marriage. Mr. Cruz was direct in his responsecalling for unwavering defense of religious liberty in the name of the constitutionand criticizing those who disagreealthough not by name.

He called out “the Fortune 500” for “running shamelessly to endorse the radical gay-marriage agenda over religious liberty.” And he lamented that “a whole lot of Republican politicians are terrified of this issue.”

“I can tell youI’ve had a proven record for over a decade of fighting to defend marriage,” he added.

Judging by the applause and nodding headsthe senator’s message was well received.

“I don’t think you can force somebody to participate in something that goes against their religion,” said Tyler Brock41who asked the first question regarding religious liberty at the event. “For me it is a litmus testbecause somebody who won’t stand up for the very first thing in our constitution is not going to stand up for a lot of things down the road.”

 1985,  2007, a, TAMPAFla.Jan. 1 — Joe Paterno stepped gingerly onto the sideline at Raymond James Stadium this morninghis cane firmly in hand as a Penn State staffersecurity and cameras hovered. It was a significant milestone in Paterno’s recovery from a broken left leg and torn ligaments on Nov. 4when he was run over on the sideline by two players during a game at Wisconsin. FinallyPaterno was back on the field.

He did not stay very long. Paternowho turned 80 on Dec. 21stood for eight minutes before slowly making his way back to the tunnel during pregame warmups and then up to the press box. He was still too fragile and immobile to risk another hit coaching the Nittany Lions against Tennessee in the Outback Bowl.

InsteadPaterno watched from above along with 65,601 fans as a defensive battle turned on an 88-yard fumble return by Penn State cornerback Tony Davis with 10 minutes 1 second remaining to lift the Nittany Lions to a 20-10 victory against No. 17 Tennessee. It as the 22nd bowl victory of Paterno’s careerand his team finished the season 9-4.

The fumble return happened one play after a 53-yard pass from Tennessee quarterback Erik Aingenephew of the Boston Celtics executive Danny Aingeto tight end Chris Brown gave the Volunteers (9-4) a first down on the Penn State 14-yard line — Tennessee’s best scoring opportunity of a lean second half.

YesBrooklyn had won the National League pennant in 18901899 and 1900but there wasn't any World Series in those years. When the Dodgers finally got to the Series in 1916they lost to the Red Sox. In 1920they lost to the Cleveland Indians before the five defeats by the Yankees. And when the 1955 Series moved to Ebbets Field for the third gamethere wasn't much hope. Podres was starting only because the front office had been unable to contact another young left-handerKen Lehmana 20-game winner at their Montreal farm team.

"About 10 days before the season ended we wanted to scratch Podres and bring in Lehman," the Dodgers' general manager thenEmil (Buzzy) Bavasisaid at the time. "But Lehman was driving home and we couldn't find him."

Bothered by a sore armPodres had a shaky 9-10 recordbut Walt Alstonthe Dodger managerwas desperate. Don Newcombehis ace with a 20-5 recordhad been battered in the opener6-5. Billy Loes didn't last four innings in a 4-2 loss to left-hander Tommy Byrne in Game 2. To add to the Dodgers' problemMickey Mantle's name was in New York's starting lineup for the first time since Sept. 16when he pulled the hamstring muscle in his right thigh. But with a baffling changeupPodres stopped the Yankees8-3in Game 3.

"In the clubhouse," Podres recalled"Alston told me'If there's a seventh gameyou're my starter.' "

In the fourth gamehomers by Duke SniderCampanella and Hodges created an 8-5 victory that Clem Labine's curveball preserved. In the fifth gamea 25-year-old leftfielderEdmundo (Sandy) Amoroshit a homer and Snider hit two as Roger Craig and Labine combined on a six-hitter5-3for a 3-2 Series lead.

"It'll be Newcombe or Spooner at the Stadium tomorrow," Alston said"but Newk has had the flu to go with his sore arm and sore back."

 2898,  2002, a, It is one of the most arresting images ever made by a war photographer. A soldier is carried on a stretcher toward medical personnel who are calmly preparing to attend to his injuries. But the operating tablethe gowned and masked nurses and surgeonthe stretcher carrier are all standing in waterand the operating room is enclosed in a mosquito-netting tent in the middle of a mangrove swamp. A nurse draws aside the flap of the tentwhose fluttery lines complement the delicate hanging tendrils and other vegetation.

 5220,  1988, a, JOE ELY delivered twangingstompingfull-tilt rock-and-roll at the Ritz119 East 11th Streeton Friday night. For a decadeMr. Ely has been singing and writing songs that match basic rock to lyrics that delight in wordplay and imagery. In the 1970'she put together a band that reflected his LubbockTex.backgroundmixing Mexican accordionsoul saxophone and country steel guitar with guitar-driven rockabilly; on his 1984 album ''Hi-Res,'' he also flirted with computers and synthesizers. Nowwith his recent album''Lord of the Highway,'' and in concerthe's decided to trade eclecticism for punch.

His currentfour-man band sounds closer to the Rolling Stones than to Lubbock's other gift to rockBuddy Holly. But on its own termsthe music can challenge Jason and the Scorchersthe Georgia Satellites and just about any other heartland rock band.

Mr. Ely has become an assured rock frontmanshouting out songs with just a little country quaver at the edge of his voice. As beforehe sings about romancehard travel and breaking looseand he hasn't simplified what he sings to fit the rock format; he still prefers lyrics with wryunheroic twists. ''Lord of the Highway,'' written by his longtime associate Butch Hancockmay be the only driving song to mention bugs on the windshield; his own ''Me and Billy the Kid,'' which he sang at the Ritz as a fast-strummedfolky solois a far cry from most self-glorifying outlaw songs. And the humor in songs like ''My Baby Thinks She's French'' and ''Driving to the Poorhouse in a Limousine'' thrives with a supercharged band behind it.

Mr. Ely's set included a guest appearance by Will Sextona 17-year-old singer and guitarist whose forthcoming debut album was produced by Mr. Ely. Mr. Sexton is a tallhearty Texas blues-rocker who has adapted to 1980's pop image-making; he stepped on stage wearing a black cowboy hata skin-tight black leather outfita single earring and impeccablepale face makeup. Fashion asidehe belted his three featured songs with honky-tonk gustoand when Mr. Ely returned Mr. Sexton shared some barnstorming lead-guitar duels with David Grissom of the Joe Ely Band.

 4925,  1990, a, In recent yearsa dramatic change in attitude toward bankruptcy has occurred within the legal profession and the corporate world. Bankruptcy was once considered a second-rate specialtylike criminal and labor law. Almost exclusively devoted to holding demanding creditors at baythe practice was disdained by the white-shoe firms; company managers viewed bankruptcy as a humiliating last resort. Butas a result of innovative lawyeringbankruptcy courts have become forums for airing product-liability problems and labor disputes. Chapter 11 has become a refuge for solvent companies such as A. H. Robinsmaker of the Dalkon Shieldand the Manville Corporationthe asbestos manufacturerwhose products have injured customers and produced an onslaught of potentially ruinous law suits. Other companiessuch as Continental Airlines and Eastern Air Lineshave availed themselves of the bankruptcy laws to break unions. Bankruptcy has thus become a sword as much as a shield. And no lawyer has wielded the sword more aggressively than Harvey Miller.

''Bankruptcy,'' Miller said in a recent speech in Houston''is like dancing with an 800 pound gorilla. You dance as long as the gorilla wants to dance.'' Typicallythe bankruptcy process involves anunpredictable conflict between the company's management and committees recognized by the court to represent creditors and shareholders. Participants on both sides have their own batteries of lawyersinvestment bankers and accountants.

''Bankruptcy practice now means one-third litigationone-third negotiation and one-third mergers and acquisitions,'' says Wilbur L. Ross Jr.a senior managing director and bankruptcy specialist at the investment banking firm of Rothschild Inc. The committees can play pivotal roles in reshaping the business. They can challenge pre-bankruptcy transactions as improper conveyances that have been executed to defraud them. Their views are solicited on sales of assetsplans for liquidation and the valuations of the new company or its individual parts. And they can seek to have management thrown out in favor of a court-appointed trustee.

In the war over control of a company in Chapter 11the first round of battle can take place outside the bankruptcy courthouse. Fearing that Pennzoil might ask Texas state courts to start seizing Texaco's assets to satisfy a $10.5 billion judgmentMiller had two associates - armed with bankruptcy papers and a walkie talkie shadow two Federal bankruptcy judges in New York over a period of months. UltimatelyMiller went with a battery of Texaco lawyers to Judge Howard Schwartzberg's house in LarchmontN.Y.on a Sunday morning in April 1987 and personally delivered the bankruptcy petition. By beating Pennzoil to the courtsMiller took the first step in keeping his client in control of the bankruptcy process.

The toughest battle is usually over who gets to file a plan of reorganization. because this will determine who among the creditors and shareholders gets paidand how muchand what form the company will assume after emerging from bankruptcy. At the outset of the bankruptcy proceedingmanagement has what is known as a period of exclusivity lasting 120 daysduring which it alone may propose the reorganization plan. A bankruptcy judge has wide discretion in deciding whether to extend exclusivity.

A SLIGHTNASAL TONE in his speech gives a clue to Harvey Miller's Brooklyn roots. Born in 1933the second of two sons of a wood-flooring salesmanhe grew up in the working-class Gravesend section. The first in his family to go beyond high schoolMiller graduated from Brooklyn College in 1954 after majoring in political science. Following a two- year army stint during which he was posted to Germanyhe entered Columbia Law School andafter graduation in 1959took a job with F. E .M. Ballona small law firm with a general practice. After a few monthshe inherited the Chapter 11 proceeding of Wise Shopsa large retail company.

''I loved it,'' he recalls. But in his next bankruptcy casehe arrived at a hearing only to discover that his opponent was Charles Seligsona professor at New York University School of Lawwho was widely regarded as a leading scholar in the field. ''I was trembling in my boots,'' Miller says. ''The judge stepped down from the benchshook Seligson's hand and said'Professorwhat an honor to see you.' ''

 5172,  1989, a, Many political analysts here say the political tensions that led to the votecoupled with the vote-buying by both sides that is said to have developed ahead of Wednesday's session of the 236-member Assemblyseem to be poor omens for the survival of democratic government in a country that has been under military rule for 24 of its 42 years. Ms. Bhutto's administration was formed after a general election last Novemberending more than a decade of military rule.

Since the no-confidence motion was introduced last weekcausing Ms. Bhutto to return hurriedly from abroadscenes have developed that have bordered on farce. In one incidenta potential defector from Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party arrived at the airport in Islamabadthe capitalto find himself being pulled in opposite directions by angryscuffling delegations from the Bhutto party and the Islamic Democratic Alliancethe main opposition group.

Lateran Alliance member of Parliamentin an Islamabad hospitalwas given a guard of 35 armed policemenapparently to sequester him from colleagues intent on keeping him from defectingbefore he was moved secretly.

In a bid to cement their positionsboth sides removed all the members of Parliament they could find to tightly patrolled hillside resorts in the mountainous country outside Islamabad. The Bhutto loyalists are in Swat75 miles northwest of herewhile Alliance followers are holed up in Murree40 miles northeast of the capital.

Stillreports of huge bribes continue to swirl around the capital. One of the few legislators available to speak to reportersan opposition membersaid that she feared being abductedor killedon her way to vote.

 6302,  1971, a, Can Work in Plainclothes

With permission of the pre cinct's commanding officerthe team will also be allowed to operate in plainclothes to deal with such problems as purse snatchers outside the shops on Utica Avenue. Nor mally orders for patrolmen to work in plainclothes require the approval of the Police Commissioner himselfwhich rarely can be obtained in less than three days.

Also in the interest of greater versatilitypatrolmen in radio cars in the sector will be allowed to park their cars and move about on foot. Under ordinary circum stancespolicemen assigned to radio cars are never al lowed to patrol on foot.

Except for thetrip to the pharmacythe business of the team's first day in action fol lowed a normal police pat tern. There was a New Year's Eve reveler who needed help up his icy front steps at 10 o'clock in the morninga mother of three who gave herself an overdose of drugs and had to be rushed to the hospitala wife who com plained that her estranged husband had punched her in the mouthand a false alarm reporting a wounded police man.

New Service Heralded

Along the waySergeant Ambrose did his best to spread the word that some thing new was happening. But when he answered a radio call by saying“This is the beat commander in the 77th,” an incredulous voice at the other end retorted: “The what?”

“It will take us a few days to get our terminology squared away,” the sergeant explained.

He was received with greater recognition by a woman who was visiting a rear apartment on Buffalo Avenue that had been bur glarized. She remembered that she had seen his picture the other day in a newspaper. “What's my name?” he asked.

“I didn't read that far,” said the woman.

“Wellit's AmbroseSer geant Ambrose. Remember it now. If you have any prob lemswe'll be here to help you.”

“Tell you the truth,” the woman said“I protect my self. I keep pots of lye and ammonia in my apartment. Anyone who tries to get in will be sorry.”

 2292,  2006, a, Click “Read more” to read the play-by-play of the Jets’ game against the Indianapolis Coltsas it happened at Giants Stadium in East RutherfordN.J.

POSTGAME: Colts 31Jets 28

There were so many lead changes in a highly entertaining second half that it’s hard to sum up. Maybe you can second-guess Mangini for going for it on fourth-and-2 instead of kicking a field goal to try to go up17-14but ultimately the Jets’ defense couldn’t stop Manning when it mattered. The defensive line didn’t put much pressure on Manning and he was able to pick the secondary apart. The most memorable part of the finale was the wild swing in the kickoff returnswith Justin Miller going 103 yards to put the Jets up28-24then Leon Washingon misplaying a kickoff to bury the Jets deep in their territory on their final possession — and the final playin which the Jets tried to lateral their way to the end zone. UPDATE: YouTube video of the Jets’ last gasp is here.

In the postgame showMangini is defending his decision to go for it on fourth downsaying that with the Colts’ explosive offensethe Jets needed maximum points.

Here are some of the final stats:

Manning and Pennington were typically efficient. Manning was 21 for 30 for 217 yardsand Pennington was 17 for 23 for 207 yards. Each had one touchdown passand Pennington was intercepted oncein the end zone on the fourth-down play.

Coles had 6 catches for 81 yardsanother fine gameand Cotchery had 3 catches for 65 yards and a touchdown. Tim Dwight had 3 catches for 31 yards. The Jets’ running backs split their carrieswith Houston gaining 49 yardsBarlow 35 and Washington 33. The Colts had great success running the ballwith Addai gaining 84 yards and Rhodes 75.

With not much separating the teamsthe turnovers proved to be crucialas they always seem to be. The Jets had two turnovers and the Colts none.

Given how the game startedwith the Pennington fumble and the quick Indy scorethe Jets acquitted themselves wellgiving the Colts (4-0) all they could handle. The Jets fall to 2-2with another tough game next Sundayat Jacksonville at 4:05but they have to feel they can stay with anybody after this game.

Here are the links from the Times writers who covered the game:

Bill Pennington has the game story.

Dave Anderson touched on Manning’s finishing touch.

Damon Hack wrote about Reggie Wayne’s chance to forget his grief.

……………………………………………………………………………

4th QuarterColts 31Jets 28

Only 50 seconds to go. The Jets have one timeout. Leon Washingtonfor some reasonis back on the kickoff return instead of Miller. A squib kick by Gramatica GETS BY WASHINGTONand he runs back and picks it up and gets tackled at the 2. DISASTER. The ball skipped by everyoneand the Jets will have to go 98 yards to win. A catch by Dwight takes the Jets to the 11. Another catchthis one by Cotcherybut there’s only 19 seconds to go. The Jets call a timeouttheir final one. They need a long reception and a spike and a field goal. Coles catches a sideline pass for 7 yards and steps outbut it’s not nearly enough. The Jets need a deeper pass. The ball is tipped away from Cotchery. Eight seconds to gono timeouts. Now it’s desperation timeno time to set up a field goal. A completionand the Jets start a crazy series of laterals — about six of them. What a final sequence! It takes about 35 seconds as the Jets throw laterals all over the fieldtrying for their own version of the Standord-Cal game. Even Pennington gets into the act with a lateralbut now the ball is fumbled and the Colts recover. The game is over. The Colts win 31-28.

CBS cuts away quickly after the gamebut on the radiothey’re saying that Coles is in pain on the fieldand the Jets’ medical staff surrounds him. He was hurt on the final play. We’ll have to wait to how badly.

The Colts lead 31-28.

4th QuarterJets 28Colts 24

Manning passes to Addai to the Colts’ 43 at the two-minute warning. Now it comes down to whether the Jets’ defense can keep Manning and the Colts out of the end zone. Reallya pretty entertaining gamewith a bunch of lead switches in the second half. Maybe the Jets should root for Manning to score early so they’ll have time to score themselves. Fletcher catches a sideline pass to the Jets’ 48. Clock stops at 1:50. Fletcher is wide open on the left for a 10-yard gain. Againhe steps out of boundsso clock is stopped. From the Jets’ 39Manning finds Clark over the middle for 4 yardsto the Jets’ 35. Manning works quickly and the ball bounces away from Wayne; Vilma almost pounces for an interception. Manning starts running a drawthen stopssees Harrison openand fires to him on the right sideline for a big gainto the Jets’ 16. The Jetsdisorganizedcall timeout to try to regroup. 1:19 to go.

The return was spectacular — a must-see on the highlights tonight. Gramatica grabbed onto his jersey and dragged him but couldn’t hold on.

4th QuarterJets 21Colts 17

First and 20 from the Jets’ 30. Manning goes for the end zone. Incomplete to Wayne. Nice play by Justin Miller. Another pass to Wayne in the end zone — incomplete — but Miller is called for pass interference. The ball will be placed on the 8. Both players were pushing — maybe it should have been a no-call. A beer bottle is thrown from the stands after the replay is shown at the stadium. Kerry Rhodes goes over and tries to calm the crowd. Addai drives down to the 3-yard line. Manning is quick to the lineand Addai gains a yard. It’s third-and-goal from the 2.

4th QuarterJets 21Colts 17

The Jets have just taken the lead. They’ve played well in the fourth quarter of all of their games. Mangini will surely say it’s because of the tough training camp he ran. Wilkins returns it to the 32. 7:50 left. A short pass to Addai for 6 yardsthen Addai runs for 6 yards. Addai for two yards. (Note: Addai was there for the Jets’ taking in the first round of the draftbut the Jets picked center Nick Mangold from Ohio State at No. 29. The Colts picked Addaifrom L.S.U. at No. 30.) Addai is stopped for 2 yards. Third and 6and the crowd is roaring! But Manning has time and he finds tight end Dallas Clark to the Jets’ 32. First down. Addai gains 4 yards as the clock ticks under 5:00. Harrison makes a catch on a quick slant for a first down. The clock is at 4:10. Manning is flushed out of the pocketbut he still finds Harrison at the Jets’ 20 on a desperation pass on an out route. Manning is in command! A holding penalty on the Colts after Addai gained five more. Vilma was heldand the Colts are going backward.

4th QuarterColts 17Jets 14

The Jets have the ball at the Colts’ 18 at first-and-10. Handoff to Washingtonwho goes up the middle for 5 yards. Washington has been a revelation in the second half. Quick playand Washington picks up three more. It’s third-and-2 at the Colts’ 10. Pennington is barking out the signals8:15 leftchanging the play at the line. Incompletebut the Colts are called for illegal contact on Colesand it’s a first down. Barlow is hit at the 5BUT HE KEEPS HIS LEGS CHURNING AND BULLS OVER FOR A TOUCHDOWN. TOUCHDOWN.

The Jets start with good field positionaround their 38after a short kick by Gramatica is brought back by the upback Matt Chatham. 6-yard gain by Washington. Nice catch by Coles on an out route for a first down. First down. The Jets are at the Indy 48. 11:50 to go. Washington finds a seam and goes for 6 yards.

But Coles makes a catch on the next play and breaks a tackle to the Colts’ 31. First down. Washington picks up 6 and 2 yards consecutively. BJ Askew picks up 5 yards for the first down with nine minutes left. The Jets do a hurry-up on the next playand the Colts ARE FORCED TO CALL TIMEOUT. They weren’t preparedand now the Colts are out of timeouts.

4th QuarterColts 17Jets 14

Dungy came out ahead in that particular coaching matchup with Manginiwho elected to go for it on fourth down from the 2 and came up empty instead of kicking the field goal. Dungy took the sure points and the Colts have the lead.

Start of the Fourth QuarterJets 14Colts 14

Rhodes finds plenty of room and runs to the Jets’ 14. Rhodes again for a coupleand it’s second and goal at the Jets’ 1. RHODES LOSES A YARDRobertson with the tackle for the Jets. He had great penetration. Ball goes to Rhodes again on third downand flags fly as he’s stopped short. Penalty against the Colts. The Jets decline. It’s fourth and goal from the 1and Dungyunlike Manginidecides to go for the field goal and the lead. Gramatica kicks it through for a 17-14 lead.

Mangini is 1 for 2 on controversial decisions. The onside kick worked to perfectionbut the decision to go for it on fourth down instead of kicking a field goal will be second-guessed. It’s easy for me to saybut since the Jets were on the 2 (the 2 1/2actually)it would have been wiser to take the 3 points.

The Coltson a third-and-2get a first down on an Addai run. Harrison gets a first down with a catch out to the Colt 49. Big running room for Addaiand he gets to the Jets’ 40 for a first down. Addai againand this time he gets 5to the Jets’ 35. Addai againfor 4and he’s a yard short of a first down. 30 seconds to go in the quarter. From the Jets’ 32Manning gives to Addaibut flags fly. It’s a false start. Third down and 6 from the Jets’ 37. Wayne is wide open for a catchand he gets to the Jets’ 23. End of the quarter. Jets14Colts 14.

Houston is carted off the field. He couldn’t put any weight on his leg. The Jets are going for it on fourth down! Another surprise by Mangini! Penningtonon a play-fakeis pressured right away and THROWS AN INTERCEPTION in the end zone. Pennington was under duressand now the Colts will be able to start at their 20 instead of their 2. The Jets get nothing and will have to like it after a time-consuming and well-executed drive.

9:12 left in the quarter. Barlow runs to the Colts’ 30. It’s third and 7. Coles comes back for the ball and makes a nice juggling catch for a first down. From the 19Barlow gets a yard up the middle. A short dumpoff pass by Penningtonthen Pennington draws the Colts offside. The Jets are at the 7. Houston gets 5 yards to the 2. After a 1-yard pickup by Houstonit’s third and goal from the 1. Pennington calls a timeout. The Jets are poised to take the leadand this will be the 15th play of the drivea drive that has chewed up eight minutes of clock. Here we go on a pivotal third down. Freeney gets into the backfield and stops Houston at the 2! Houston is injuredprone on the field. Now what will Mangini do? He probably needs to kick the field goal. The ball is at the 2. There is 4:55 to go in third quarterand Jets trainers are on the field examining Houston’s knee. Timeout.

3nd QuarterJets 14Colts 14

Penningtonstarting at the Jets’ 21completes a pass to Coles on the sideline after a play-action fake and a rollout. It’s a first down. Houston runs for 2. Houston runs again for 4 more to the Jets’ 37and it’ll be third-and-four. Pennington feels pressureand he runs and slides for a first downjust beyond the marker. Tony Dungy throws the red challenge flag; he thinks Pennington slid before the first-down marker. Seems to be a bad call by Dungy; it looked like Pennington made it. After a reviewthe play stands. The Jets are at their 41 with 11:50 left in the quarter. False start on the Jetsby Kendallwho is back in the lineup today. Houstonrunning behind Fergusonturns the corner for a 4-yard gain. Pennington scrambles and hits Colesand Coles beats his man after the catch for a first down at the Colts’ 46. Cedric Houston pierces through middle — the Jets’ ground game is alive! — and he gets to the 34. Pennington throws a jump ball for Coles near the end zoneand it’s incomplete. 9:12 to go. The Colts burn a timeout to get an injured playerKelvin Haydenoff the field. Indy has one timeout leftand Dungy is steaming that there wasn’t an injury timeout called by the officials.

Colts start the second half with a short run by Rhodes to the 33. Quick pass to Harrisonand he gets to the Colts’ 47 — a 14-yard pickup. Harrison passes Andre Reed for fourth on the career list of receptions. After a short run and an incompletionit’s third and 7. Manning under pressureand HE’S SACKED BY ELLIS. A big loss and the second sack by Ellis. 13:00 to go in the quarter. The Colts punt. The Jetsan 8-point or 9-point underdogdepending on who you believeare playing Indy on an equal footing.

HALFTIMEJets 14Colts 14

Welcome to the halftime report. The Jets seemed completely lost in the first quarter. Pennington coughed up a quick fumbleand the Colts took advantage with a quick touchdown. The Jets’ running game gained 9 total yards in the quarterand the Colts were ripping off consistent chucks of yardage behind Rhodes and Addai. But the Jets turned it around thanks to:

1) Jerricho Cotcherywho continued the Jets’ success in YAC (yards after catch) with a nice run on a 33-yard touchdown reception.

2) Eric Mangini and Mike Nugentwho combined on a successful onside kick. Mangini had the guts to call itand Nugent executed it perfectly.

Now have the Jets succeeded in merely making the Colts angry? We’ll see in the second half.

End of the halfJets 14Colts 14

Justin Miller gets a great return off to the 49but Pennington is sacked (Robert Mathis’s second sack) and the clock runs out on the halfwith the score tied at 14-14.

2nd QuarterJets 14Colts 14

Addai is the lone backand he picks up about four yards to the Jets’ 16. Manning passes to Wayneand there may be a facemask against the Jets. The officials confer for quite a while. After lengthy deliberationsthe officials say there’s no facemask — incidental contact. It’s third and 4 at the Jets’ 13. Addai catches a pass in the left flat and gets a first downadvancing to the Jets’ 9. It’s first-and-goal with 37 seconds to go. Harrison with a catch at the 2-yard line. Manning is hurrying upand Addai SCORES FROM THE 2. TOUCHDOWN. The Jets were not completely setand Manning tood advantage with a quick handoff. Addai went up the middle for the score. The extra point is good. It’s 14-14.

2nd QuarterJets 14Colts 7

What the heck is going on here? The Jets were abysmal in the first quarterand now they’re in complete command. Peyton Manning hasn’t touched the ball in about 10 minutes. Now Wilkins drops the ball on the kickoff and picks it up. Indy starts at its 15. A long bomb to Reggie Wayne. Wayne skies high to catch it! A great catch. And the Colts are at the Jets’ 44. Rhodes runs left and gains 9 to the Jets’ 35. Rhodes picks up a yard for the first down. The Colts are on the move. Play-actionand Manning just misses Harrison in the end zone. It goes off Harrison’s fingertips. Rhodes runs for 2. Third-and-8. Manning finds Harrison for a first down at the Jets’ 20. It’s the two-minute warning. It’s as if the Jets have made the Colts angry. I think the Colts may be shocked that the Jets are still in the game. The Jets were so pathetic in the first quarter that the Colts might have let down.

2nd QuarterJets 14Colts 7

Houston slips and falls at the 11. The crowd groans. It’s second and goaland Houston rumbles for 8 yards to the 3. It’s third and goal. Houston is providing some power running. Pass incomplete to Cotcherybut a flag comes out. They’re going to call pass interference. Cotchery was hit before he could catch it. Barlow STROLLS INTO THE END ZONE FROM THE 1. TOUCHDOWNJETS. It completes an 11-play drive after the onside kick. Nugent is good with the extra pointand it’s 14-7 Jets.

2nd QuarterColts 7Jets 7

An onside kick. A SURPRISE. AND THE JETS RECOVER. Mangini surprises the Colts with an onside kickand Nugent executes it well. Kerry Rhodes — that man again — recovers for the Jets. The Jets are at their own 43good field position to start. Another catch by Cotcheryand a gain of 18 yardsand the crowd is roaring. It’s a hurry-up offenseno-huddle. Barlow has roomto the 34. 9:25 to go in the half. Barlow again for a few yards. Third-and-2. Barlow is close to a first downbut he’s short. The Jets are going for it on fourth down. The game’s tenor has completely changed. Cotchery’s 33-yard touchdown catch and the successful onside kick have kick-started the Jets and the crowd. It’s fourth-and-1 and the Jets call timeout with 7:55 to go. Brad Smith steps under center again. AN OPTION. It works. Smith pitches out to Washingtonand Washington makes a man miss and barely gets the first down. A risky movebut it works. A pass to Coles in the end zone is knocked away. A give to Barlow and he gains 6. All of a suddenthe Jets are controlling the clock and the game. 6:40 to go. A dumpoff over the middle to Tim Dwightand a late flag. Unnecessary roughness against the Coltsand the ball moves to the Colts’ 7.

2nd QuarterColts 7Jets 7

Jets start at their 35. 13:22 to go in the half. A short catch by Ryanthe tight end. Cedric Houston is the lone setback nowand he carries for a few yards. It’s third-and-1. Play-actioncatch by Colesbut a flag at the line. Will the play stand? Illegal motion is the call (Chris Baker)and third down will be repeated. A momentum killer. It’s now 3rd-and-6. Pennington scrambles and completes a pass to Tim Dwight. First down beyond midfield. Houston gains 13 yards to the 33. That’s the Jets’ longest running play of the season. CATCH by Cotchery. Beautiful stiff-arm after a catch in the middle of the field. He goes left and stiff-arms a Colts defender near the goal line. TOUCHDOWN for the Jets if the play stands. Flag at the linebut offsides on the defenseSO THE PLAY STANDS. Nugent’s extra point is goodso it’s 7-7. Waita penalty on the extra pointso they’ll have to try again. It’s good againand it’s officially 7-7.

2nd QuarterColts 7Jets 0

Colts start at their 35 after a booming Ben Graham punt. The Colts have had no success through the airbut they haven’t needed it. Addai gets the call and he gets 3thenand this is getting repetitiousAddai againfor a couple more. Incomplete pass by Manning on third-and-3. So we have two trends: The Colts are running the ball wellbut Manning and the passing game have been ineffective. Go figure. The Colts punt.

1st QuarterColts 7Jets 0

Jets start at their 5. Barlow againgoing nowhere. The Jets haven’t had a first down! And they’re going backward with minus-19 passing yards. I think they’ve rushed for 8 yards! A short catch by Baker and a gain of 5 yards. Brad Smith is the QBand Pennington lines up wideand Smith runs for a first down. The Jets’ first good offensive playwith a little trickery! A poor pass by Penningtonand Coles can’t get it. Third down and 12. Four receivers for the Jets. The fans hate this call — a draw to Washingtonand he only gets a few. So the Jets punt. End of the first quarter.

1st QuarterColts 7Jets 0

Colts start from their 35. Commercial: A Chunky Soup ad with Donovan McNabb and his motherand I’m starting to feel hungry. (Must sit here and type!). Here the Colts go againgiving the ball to Joseph Addaiand he gets 9 yards. The Colts’ line is blowing the Jets off the ball. Addai againfor a first down. Colts are at midfield. Addai againand the running-back-by-committee is in full roar. The Jets started by consistently giving the ball to Rhodesand now they’re giving it to Addai on every play. On third-and-four from the Jet 44the Colts have a false start. Surely Manning will pass. Manning calls timeout with 3:48 to go in the quarter. Manning escapes good pressure from the Jets (Erik Coleman and Bobby Hamilton)but the Jets force a punt. It’s a good oneto the Jets’ 5with 3:12 to go.

1st QuarterColts 7Jets 0

Jets start from their 30. Barlow goes nowhere — again. The running game is offering Pennington no support whatsoever. Washington showed some spark last weekbut so far the Jets are going with Barlow. This timeBarlow loses a yardand the crowd is not hiding its feelings — full-throated jeers. It’s 3rd-and-11putting Pennington under the gun. Play-actionscrambling backand Pennington is sacked. Another rotten start for the Jets in the first quarter. They haven’t scored in the quarter all year.

1st QuarterColts 7Jets 0

The Colts start with 10:28 left in the quarter at their 40. Rhodes runs againand he takes the pile out to the 48. Rhodes runs again for 3 yards for a first down. So farthe offense amounts to giving the ball to Rhodes. The Colts are taking a page from the Bills’ strategy — Buffalo just ran Willis McGahee right at ’emand the Jets couldn’t stop him (JP Losman was a different story). Manning goes back to passand Shaun Ellis chases Manning and sacks him. ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE 36. Gets the crowd back in the game. The Colts punt.

1st QuarterColts 7Jets 0

Wellif you’re a Jets fanthat’s a disheartening beginning. The Jets were adept at the turnover battle in the first three games — Mangini had made a point about it being a priority. They figured to need an almost error-free game to beat the Coltsand they’re already heading in the wrong direction. Leon Washington loses a yard after slipping as the Jets start over. Barlow gets nothing on the next runand they’re back to the line of scrimmage. On 3rd-and-11Pennington completes a short passbut it’s not nearly enough for a first down. Dwight Freeney sniffed it out. The crowd grumbles. It’s three-and-out.

1st QuarterColts 0Jets 0

Pennington hit from behind on the third play from scrimmageand the ball IS LOOSE. Pennington fumbles after being sacked. The Colts recover on the Jets’ 26. The Jets had advanced to the 39 on a Colts penalty and a nice run by Barlow. But an awful start for the Jets. And now Dominic Rhodes runs to the 11. Rhodes againand he goes to the 6. Rhodes againAND HE SCORES FROM THE 6. TOUCHDOWN. He powers over with 12:28 left in the first quarter. A similar start to last week’s; the Bills scored on the second play from scrimmage. It’s 7-0 Colts. Already.

Moments away from kickoff. The Jets win the toss and will receive. Short kick; Chris Baker takes it out to the 26and that’s where the Jets will start. The crowd is raucous. The field is a little dampbut the weather doesn’t seem bad.

UPDATE: Laveranues Coles (calf) is active for the Jets. He played through the calf injury last week and had 10 catches for 78 yards. Colts receiver Brandon Stokely (ankle sprain) is out.

Pregame prediction from ESPN Radio’s Greg Buttleformer Jets linebacker: Colts win34-30. But he predicted the Bills would win last week.

……………………………………………………………………

Helloall. I hope I can be of service todaywhether you’re watching the game on TV and would like to comment or whether you’re following it from afarin North America or around the world.

I’m reporting live from my den in Westchester Countyvia the CBS broadcast and the Jets radio broadcast. I’m going to try to sit here and type for four hours (without getting up)putting my bladder on the line for you. What can you do for me? Send me a message on Jets-Colts or anything that strikes your fancy.

Firstsome news. ESPN is reporting that the Colts’ Adam Vinatieri will not kick. Vinatieri’s sore groin acted up in warmups. Martin Gramatica will kick for Indianapolis.

Here’s some recommended pregame reading: Greg Garber’s ESPN.com article on Chad Pennington’s journey to recovery. Pennington talks about how he took steps to improve his arm strength (he’s never going to have a great armbut he’s not lobbing the ball the way he did last year). An excerpt:

He and his father Elwood watched clips of Pennington and compared it to footage of strong-armed quarterback John Elway. “Having two shoulder injuriesit showed some flaws in my mechanics,” Pennington said. “I always thought I used my body well to throwbut I really didn’t. I was really an arm thrower and that’s why the ball would die on me a lot. That’s why my feet sometimes weren’t planted in the ground when I was throwingand the ball would flutter.

“And soI really had to look at that.”

The Jets are a surprising 2-1 and the Colts are an unsurprising 3-0 and an 8-point favorite at Giants Stadium. Last seasonIndy became the fourth NFL team to start 13-0. Of coursewe all know what happened in the playoffs last season — and the Colts’ history as underachievers in the postseason in general. But in the regular season? Pretty hard to beat.

Some pregame notes:

In a Rush: The Jets will want to try to control the clock and keep Manning off the field. But they only rushed for just 74 yards on 24 carries last Sundayand they have gained only 217 rushing yards this season (an average of 2.6 yards). The Jets’ longest run from scrimmage is Brad Smith’s 12-yard end-around against the Titans in the opener. Smiththe former Missouri quarterbackhas one catchfor 13 yardsin his rookie season as a wide receiver. He was one of the most exciting college players of the last few yearsand we’ll see if he gets more action today — perhaps in a trick play.

Wayne’s Burden: After the Colts’ victory over Jacksonville last weekReggie Wayne flew to Louisiana to help his family make funeral arrangements for his older brotherRashadwho died in an car accident last Sunday. Wayne is expected to play today.

Turnovers: In an article in The Times yesterdayEric Mangini said that the stat that mattered most to him was turnover differential. The Jets are plus-5 this seasontied for second in the AFC. The former Jets linebacker Bryan Coxnow a Jets assistantcharts every fumle and interception at every game and practice. “Turnovers have the biggest correlation to winning a game,” Jonathan Vilma said. There was no better example than last week. The Bills outgained the Jets475-256but lost the turnover battle3-0and the game28-20.

Awards: Lavenanues Coles was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Month. He leads the league with 24 catches. His 331 receiving yards are the most by a Jet in the first three game of a season since Don Maynard’s 356 in 1968 (the Jets went on to win the Super Bowl — their only Super Bowl victory and their only Super Bowl appearance.)

D’Brickashaw Ferguson vs. Dwight Freeney: a classic matchup of sack specialist versus left tackle. Michael Lewisthe author of “Moneyball,” has raised awareness about how pivotal the left tackle-defensive end showdown can bein an excerpt from his latest book in Sports Illustratedand in another excerpt in The New York Times magazine (well worth reading; click here).

Masters of disguises: Manning and Pennington are brilliant at ball-handling — maybe the best two in the league. By ball-handlingwe mean hiding the ball after a fake handoff and setting up a play-action pass. Something to keep an eye on.

Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lessonstudents brainstorm creative and imaginative solutions to economic and other problems in Mexico and the United States to help stem the flow of perilous border crossings. Students then use their ideas to formulate a coherent plan to present to lawmakers.



Author(s):

Kari KohlThe New York Times Learning Network

Suggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes-1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Respond to a controversial statement on U.S. immigration policy.

2. Examine the dangerous conditions illegal immigrants will face to reach the U.S. by reading and discussing “The Desperate Risk Death in a Desert.”

3. Generate creative solutions to the immigration problem on the U.S.-Mexico border.

4. Formulate a coherent policy to present to U.S. lawmakers.

Resources / Materials:

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-paper

-classroom blackboard

-copies of “The Desperate Risk Death in a Desert” (one per student)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journalsstudents respond to the following (written on the board prior to class): “React to the following statement: The U.S. allows in too many immigrants and should tighten its borders.” Students then share their answers.

2. As a classread and discuss “The Desperate Risk Death in a Desert,” focusing on the following questions:

a. Why are there only wire fences to mark the tightly patrolled border between Mexico and the United States?

b. What does Mr. Flores worry about on his border crossing?

c. Why has the area around SasabeMexico become the newest gateway for illegal immigrants?

d. How dangerous is crossing the Altar Desert? Why?

e. Why do people make the dangerous journey across the border?

f. What has been the effect of doubling the number of agents patrolling the border between Mexico and the U.S.?

g. What is being done to make immigration safer along the Arizona-Mexico border? Who is leading these efforts?

h. How have the towns along the border changed as illegal immigration has increased?

3. In the articleRoberto Rodriguez Hernandezthe Mexican Consul in Nogalesis quoted as saying“We have to find more creative and imaginative ways; ways that address the need for workers in the United States and the lack of good opportunities in Mexico.” Students will brainstormin groups of threeto find some creative and imaginative ways to make changes that will affect the desire of Mexicans to emigrate. Students should be encouraged to think about creative economic solutions to the problem. After brainstorming these ideasgroups will share them with the classand the teacher will make a list of possible solutions for the class to see and discuss.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Using the possible solutions brainstormed in classstudents will write letters to their Senator or Representative to the U.S. Congress outlining plans to decrease illegal immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border. Students may choose to send these to their representatives in Washington.

Further Questions for Discussion:

–Can you imagine being so poor and desperate that you would be willing to risk your life to improve your fortunes? What do you think that would be like? –If the situation in the United States became desperate and you needed to leavewhere would you go? Why?

–How do illegal immigrants fit into the United States economy? What would happen if the U.S. succeeded in stopping all illegal immigration?

–The United States has recently increased the number of legal immigrants it allows to enter. Why has it done this? Why has this change made almost no difference in stopping illegal immigration from Mexico?

–Do you agree or disagree with Mexican government officials and human rights advocates who lay the blame for deaths in the Arizona desert on the “failuresand even crueltyof recent United States border enforcement operations”?

–Do you think the border patrol’s job is to stop illegal immigrants or save them? Are these tasks mutually exclusive?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on written journal entriesparticipation in class and small group discussionsand written homework assignments.

Vocabulary:

Extension Activities:

1. Create a detailed map of the border between Mexico and the United Stateswith all the border towns and the geographical features. Mark the area written about in the featured article.

2. The European Union began as separate nations and has slowly turned into one large “market.” Study the steps the E.U. has taken to reach today’s status. Write an essay explaining if you think the same type of union might one day exist between the U.S.Mexicoand Canadawhose NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) is similar to the beginnings of the E.U. Explain why you believe as you do.

3. Create an “Illegal Immigration” board game. Learn about the process of illegal immigrationand use this knowledge to create positive and negative scenarios for your players.

4. Brainstorm common American myths about Mexican culture. Then study the culture of the different states and regions of Mexico. Create a poster showing which myths are true and correcting commonly held misconceptions.

5. Write a first person autobiographical account of everyday life in Mexicodetailing the conditions that lead so many to choose the dangers of illegal immigration over staying where they are.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

American History- Create a timeline of U.S. immigration since 1900. For each decade document the number of immigrants (legal and estimates of illegal)their national originsand any major changes in immigration law or policy.

Civics- Examine in detail the process of gaining citizenship in the United States. Create a visual display explaining each step of the process.

Fine Arts- Create a three-dimensional desert landscape such as the one illegal immigrants cross to get to Arizona. Try to evoke the conditions immigrants encounter during the perilous journey.

Journalism- Collect at least 5 articles about illegal immigration from a variety of sources. Compare the attitude of each author toward illegal immigrationthe immigrants themselvescoyotesthe Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)and the United States Border Patrol.

Other Information on the Web:

The Immigration and Naturalization Service (//www.ins.usdoj.gov/graphics/index.htm) provides information on immigration services and benefitslegislation updatesand news on border management.

National Immigration Forum (NIF) (//www.immigrationforum.org/) defends legal immigrationfights anti-immigrant prejudiceand seeks to preserve the American tradition of diversity.

 3904,  1997, a, Latelyhe has dropped the tennisbut not the running. And soafter a cup of extra-strong coffeehe walked two blocks to the long stretch of pavement on the Brooklyn waterfront where he has put in so many miles that he knows every stride-throwing hummock and dip.

He had to pull up his white sockswhich had slipped to somewhere just north of his ankles. Then he decided to peel off his dark blue sweatshirteven though it was one of those mornings when the temperature was struggling to make it out of the 40's.

Mr. Weintraub has the course figured out. He plans to jog to the Williamsburg Savings Bank in Brooklynabout 8 miles from the starting line. ''If my pace is slowing upI'll walk after that,'' he said. ''I'm a fast walker.'' But when he hits Greenpoint Avenuehe intends to start jogging againright straight into Long Island City. He may do some more walking on the way to Manhattanbut by the time he is closing in on Central Parkhe will be going full speed.

''You're born with your speed -- nothing you can do about it,'' he said. ''Speed doesn't mean a thing when you run 26 miles. The good runnersthe fellows who teach methey start off very fast. But it's not how you do the first 5 miles. It's not a question of the orderjust finish.''

The medical director for the marathonDr. Andres Rodriguezsaid much the same thing.

''Older people know not to push themselves to go too fast or too farso they finish and finish fine,'' he said. ''It's the younger people who think'I can do it in 5 hours.' '' Asked about Mr. Weintraubhe said''If he feels comfortable running this distancefine. Physiologicallyhe sounds like he's 50 or 60.''

Mr. Weintraub's memories are those of a much older manthough. In his apartmenthe is looking at the photographs of himself and his wife on their wedding day in 1936. He is talking rapidly nowremembering his courtship and one unexpected moment. ''She gave me the ring back,'' he says. ''I thought she'd picked somebody else.''

It turned out that she had not. They were married for 57 years. But questions about their life can still be troubling. How long has it been since she died?

''I can't remember,'' he saysand there is a catch in his voice. ''I always think of her smileher beautiful smileand she took that with her.''

Thursday’s 11:30 a.m. session at the Bikram Yoga NYC studio in the Flatiron District began as usual: a handful of half-dressed students slowly flapped their elbows as they decelerated their breath and stared at themselves in the mirror. After paying as much as $25 eachthey began their mindful workouts in the 105-degree “Torture Chamber,” while outside on Fifth Avenuepedestrians scurried past in coats.

A few blocks awayon West 27th Streetabout 30 pupils soon began the same breathing exercisesdripping with sweat in the 103-degree heat. But this classlabeled “Traditional Hot Yoga” and offered by the growing studio chain Yoga to the Peoplecost just $8.

“Yoga should be for everyone,” Matt Hillocka blissed-outwrung-out studentsaid after the lower-priced class.

But Bikram Choudhurythe millionaire founder of Bikram Yogabelieves his kind of yoga belongs to him — he has even copyrighted it. Nowhe has sued Yoga to the People for copyright infringementseeking monetary damages and asking a federal judge to block Yoga to the People from offering its hot yoga class.

“We sent an investigator to take the classes,” Robert GilchrestMr. Choudhury’s lawyersaid on Thursday. “The classes were virtually mirror images and the dialogue was consistently the same.”

Despite yoga’s long historyMr. Gilchrest said that Mr. Choudhury had the right to claim his own 26-posture sequence and the instructor’s dialogue.

“Words have been in existence since women and men started speakingbut you can copyright a sequence of words,” Mr. Gilchrest said.

The founder of the Yoga to the People studiosGreg Gumuciobegan as Mr. Choudhury’s student. He said the guru enlightened him by saying“You are your own teacher. You are responsible for your own experience.”

That led Mr. Gumucio to the realization that high-profile (and expensive) instructors were not necessary for successful yoga study. And in 2006 he opened Yoga to the People in the East Village. Now the chainwhich also offers its classes in non-heated rooms on a voluntary-donation basishas five studios in New York and one each in San Francisco and BerkeleyCalif.and Seattle.

Mr. Choudhury’s suit (see also below)filed in Californiawhere Bikram is basedhas a different philosophy — that he is responsible for students’ success. Aspiring Bikram teachers must take his formal nine-week$7,000 course. Once certifiedinstructors must obtain his permission to open studios.

The suitreported Wednesday by the Manhattan news site DNAinfocalls Mr. Gumucio’s instructors “impostors,” and charges that he broke his agreement to follow Mr. Choudhury’s rules.

The rivalry has been brewing for some time. In Augustanother Bikram outletBikram Yoga Manhattansaid it was closing one of its studios because “the presence of our competitors,” namely Yoga to the People“has made it impossible for us to continue.”

Mr. Gumuciohoweversaid he never agreed to abide by Mr. Choudhury’s rules and that was why he split with him.

“For almost five yearsI worked with Bikram was often a guest in his home and he in mine,” Mr. Gumucio wrote in an e-mail. “I have never agreed with Bikram and his idea that he owned the yogaor that he should sue anyone.”

Mr. Choudhury has taken legal action against imitators before. He is currently suing two other studios for copyright infringementMr. Gilchrest saidand he reached a monetary settlement with a Los Angeles studio in 2003.

One regular student of Yoga to the PeopleDiane Pamphilepronounced Mr. Choudhury’s suit “mean.“

“I’m a student,” she said. “We can’t afford expensive yoga classes. I commute from Queens just to come here.” She is one of more than 3,000 signers of a petition on the Web site yogatruth.org that defends Yoga to the People’s ability to continue teaching the style.

Chelsea Channing Portney23a Bikram student for nearly five yearssaid she loves the classesbut doesn’t think Mr. Choudhury should be able to claim the poses as his own.

“I don’t believe that Bikram should be able to own those movessince they have been around for hundreds if not thousands of years,” she said.

Stillshe will keep going to the classes. “While I don’t agree with BikramI personally love my teachers and the people I have met,” she said.

Mr. Gumucio said that his sequence of poses is not exactly the same as Mr. Choudhury’s.

“I cringe at the thought of the farfar reaching ramifications that this lawsuit holds,” he wrote. “If the originators of this traditional knowledge had attempted to copyrighttrademark or own in any way yogaa yoga posea yoga sequencethen perhaps nobody today would have the joy of experiencing yoga.”

In a 2007 op-ed in The New York Timesthe writer Suketu Mehta noted that the United States had issued 150 yoga-related copyrights and called Mr. Choudhury’s legal actions “a gross violation of the tradition of yoga.”

“There is a line in the Hindu scriptures: ‘Let good knowledge come to us from all sides,’ ” Mr. Mehta wrote. “There is no follow-up that adds‘And let us pay royalties for it.’ ”

 2444,  2005, a, At Auburn in 2003he shared backfield time with Ronnie Brown and Carnell Williamswho were selected second and fifth over all in the draft in April. Jacobs then transferred to Southern Illinoiswhere he rushed for 922 yards and 19 touchdowns last season.

Along the waycoaches have broached the topic of changing his position. At Auburnhe tried tight end and linebacker when he realized he was not the top running back.

"None of it worked," he said. "None of it was me. I triedbut I had to do what was best for me."

He parlayed that into a chance with the Giantsa team with an annual vacancy for a backup running back.

Barber said he thought Cloud would fill the role admirably this year and that Jacobs and Derrick Warda second-year playerrepresented the future. In recent seasonsit has been far too easy for Giants coaches to leave Barber on the field for nearly every play. He has been increasingly productive; he rushed for a career-high and franchise-record 1,518 yards last seasondespite playing behind a leaky offensive line. He is the franchise leader in rushing yards (6,927) and receptions (474 catches).

Despite his age30and his high-mileage bodyBarber says he believes he has several seasons of success ahead.

"I think it's a myth that's being disproved as the years go on byguys like myself and Curtis Martin and Corey Dillon who's 30 as well," Barber said. "It's all a function of how much work you put inhow you take care of your bodyhow you keep yourself healthy.

"I've been able to do that the last few years. As long as you still have the desireyou can play this game as long as you want. Eventually you'll slow down."

 200,  2018, a, Just as the Duplex opened its doors at 4 in the afternoonHarry Arkell34a tourist from the United Kingdomtook a seat at the bar and ordered a glass of red wine. The former marketing executive had recently quit his jobended a relationship and completed a weeklong meditation camp upstate. He would soon be headed for Panamabut not before making a pit stop in New York.

“I was told by a friend the Duplex is an institution,” he said. “I came to see what it was about.”

In 1951 the Duplex opened in a makeshift space above a restaurant on Grove Street. It served as a cabaret theater for Broadway hopefuls and amateur comediansincluding a young Joan Rivers — said Thomas Honeckthe theater’s general manager. “It was said Rivers was so bad at the timethey would only let her go last,” he said.

After going through a discothèque phase in the ’70sthe Duplex returned to its cabaret rootsmoving to 61 Christopher Street in 1989. On the ground floorthere is a simple piano bar with black vinyl seating that was purchased from a former diner. The wall behind the bar is covered in posters for shows that have long passed. Many of the bartenders have vocal chopsso it is not unusual to find some of them singing musical numbers from “Kinky Boots” or pop songs by Elton John or Ariana Grande.

From the Seventh Avenue and Christopher Street intersectionpassers-by can glimpse an often rowdy and enthusiastic crowd singing through its many French doors.

Donald J. Trump has been ruffling feathers with Hispanics with his tough talk on immigrationbut on Tuesday the Republican presidential candidate took a step to try to smooth things over.

Mr. Trump invited Javier Palomarezpresident of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerceto his Manhattan office for a meeting to clear the air. Each were joined by two staff members for a 90-minute meeting that Mr. Palomarez described as surprisingly cordial and productive.

“He was very mannerlyvery hospitable and never once did he interrupt me,” Mr. Palomarez saidnoting that Mr. Trump listened more than he talked during the meeting.

Mr. Trump declined to commentbut his spokeswoman acknowledged that the meeting took place.

Mr. Palomarez said that he had expressed his disapproval with Mr. Trump’s plan to build a wall along the border with Mexico and to deport millions of immigrants in the country illegally. He also explained to Mr. Trump that such moves would severely cost the construction and hospitality industrieswhich rely on the labor of immigrants.

Mr. Trump politely disagreedMr. Palomarez saidand made the case that undocumented workers were imposing significant costs on the United States economy.

While Mr. Palomarez said he was not endorsing Mr. Trumphe did express “shock” at how friendly the conversation was and and said he was impressed with the candidate.

“He was not combativehe was not rude,” Mr. Palomarez said. “He was a complete gentleman.”

Despite the warmer feelingsdifferences remain.

Mr. Palomarez said that when he and Mr. Trump discussed the idea of the chamber holding its convention in Miami next yearMr. Trump suggested that it be held at the Trump National Doral Resort there. Given Mr. Trump’s recent tone toward HispanicsMr. Palomarez saidsuch a choice was unlikely.

Re “Helping to Lift the Burden of Student Debt” (The UpshotJan. 25)about income-based repaymentwhich caps student loan payments and offers loan forgiveness after 25 yearsor 10 years for those working in public service jobs:

As a law school graduate working as a public defender with over $155,000 in combined undergraduate/graduate student load debtI can tell you that the revolution described in the article stopped short at addressing the real issues affecting student loan borrowers like me.

While it’s true that the changes in student loan repayment plans have lessened the risk of default for public loan borrowers exclusivelyincome-based repayment plans aren’t addressing the fundamental problems that having enormous student loan debt can have on individuals seeking to grow and attain what I call the “benchmarks of adulthood” — like the inability to save for retirementor save for a down payment on a homeor the difficulties of getting a mortgage due to high student loan debt — and the challenges of expanding a family with few financial resources.

I’m on the income-based repayment plan and hope one dayeight years from nowto have my student loan debt forgiven in exchange for providing essential legal services to our community’s most vulnerable. I take pride in my work and hope to continue serving high-need populationsbut I know that in doing so I am making it difficultif not impossibleto reach these benchmarks of adulthood until I’m 40 because my crippling student loan debt simply doesn’t leave me with enough financial resources.

 1979,  2007, a, The sky was pitch black and a steady rain was falling when Eliot Spitzerthe new governorarrived at the Spanish Revival lake house in Washington Park at 5:43 a.m. Monday to keep his first campaign promise: taking a morning run through the park on his first day in office.

“I have one simple question: Whose idea was this?” Mr. Spitzer joked after he entered the lake house to cheers from friendssupporters and local residents. He marveled that old friends from college – “people who would never have been up this early” – had managed to roust themselves from bed in the wee hours of New Year’s Day.

At a campaign rally in the lake house on Sept. 6six days before the Democratic primaryMr. Spitzer had promised to run through the parkwhich is west of the State Capitolon his first day as governor. “It was one of those impromptu moments where you immediately say‘Why did I say that?’ ” Mr. Spitzer recalled.

Washington Park was surveyed and planned by Frederick Law Olmstedwho designed Central Park. Mayor Gerald D. Jenningswho greeted Mr. Spitzer at the lake housecalled the park “the jewel of the city.” A Democrat who took office in 1994Mr. Jennings said the run showed that the new governor cared about the capitalwhich like many upstate cities is struggling to revive a sluggish local economy.

Leading a pack of more than 100 runners – dozens of them wearing blue T-shirts with the slogan “Day One…Everything Is Changing” – Mr. Spitzer wound his way west along the lake; up a hill toward State Streetone of the city’s most elegant and historic thoroughfares; past the Soldiers and Sailors Monument; and along a bridle path back to the lake house.

The route was just short of 2 miles. The run started at 5:50 a.m. and ended 13 minutes laterat 6:03 a.m.

Sweaty and somewhat out of breathMr. Spitzer said afterwards“I appreciate all of your supportloyaltyarguably bad judgmentgetting out here this time of daybut heythat’s what makes us New Yorkers.” He joked this daughter Elyssawho is a cross-country runner and joined him for the jog“leaves me in the dust.”

Mr. Spitzerwho ran in the New York City marathon in 1983finishing just under 4 hourssaid he tries to work out 5 times a weekoften using exercise machineseven though he lives close to Central Park and still runs there.

Mr. Spitzerwho was sworn in at midnightsaid he got to bed at 1:30 a.m. and woke up when “the internal clock started kicking in about 4:30because I thought I’d be late” for the run.

The new governor spoke admiringly of the Executive Mansionwhere he took the oath of officenoting that on one wall was an original copy of the Constitution from 1787 andbelow itnotes from the Poughkeepsie Conventionwhere New York decided to ratify the constitutionwith the signatures of Alexander Hamilton and John Jay.

Mr. Spitzer said his predecessorGeorge E. Patakihad left behind a lengthy notefollowing a tradition for governors to give parting advice to their successors.

The public inauguration ceremony was moved ahead from noon to 1 p.m. in the hope that the dismal weather would liftbut Mr. Spitzer said he did not mind the precipitation. “Rain is cleansing,” he said. “We’re washing away the dirty and the grime. We’re going to start fresh. It’s going to be great. It’s starting to clear up. I can feel it.”

Then he got in his black Chevrolet Suburban and took off at 6:10 a.m. It was not clear whether he intended to go back to sleep.

 2389,  2005, a, They asked for policy details and all results since the N.F.L. began testing for steroids. The league began testing for steroids in 1987 and started randomyear-round drug testing in 1990. The committee is not asking for the identities of individual players -- 44 are known to have been suspended for testing positive -- but it is asking for the number of players tested and the number of positive tests for each drug.

Tagliabue promised full cooperation. The N.F.L. has one of the toughest steroids policies in professional sports and recently announced it wanted to toughen its program to Olympic standards.

The letter to the N.F.L. was the first in a series of letters that will be sent to the other sports organizations as early as MondayRobert Whitea spokesman for the committeewrote in an e-mail message yesterday.

Davis and Waxman also wrote in the letter to Tagliabue that the committee would hold additional hearings at an unspecified time. They had previously said they would consider additional hearings after the March 17 hearingat which the retired slugger Mark McGwire refused to answer questions about whether he had used steroids and members of Congress criticized baseball's new steroids policy.

"As the committee has stated publicly numerous timesits focus on the issue of performance-enhancing drug use in sports is not limited to professional baseball," Davis and Waxman wrote to Tagliabue. "The hearing was the first in a series for the committee as part of its ongoing investigation into steroid policies for professional and amateur sports."

The Washington Postanother newspaper struggling to trim costsis planning to move out of the District of Columbia headquarters where its news staff has worked for nearly four decades.

Katharine Weymouththe paper’s publishersent a memo to the staff on Friday morning announcing that the company was looking into a move and had hired two real estate firmsStudley Inc. and JM Zell Partnersas advisers. The company is also interviewing space planners and architects for guidance.

“Our preliminary analysis suggests that a move will make good operational and economic sensehowever we have not yet decided on where or when,” Ms. Weymouth said in her memo.

Since the company removed its presses more than a decade agoMs. Weymouth said“we are no longer tied to this particular location.”

According to the company’s Web sitea $5 million printing plant was built at the current location on 15th Street NW in 1950and The Post’s $25 million headquarters building was officially dedicated there in October 1972. Katharine Grahamthe former publisher and Ms. Weymouth’s grandmotheroriginally wanted I. M. Pei to design the building in the shape of a typewriteraccording to Dave Kindreda former Post columnist who wrote a 2010 book about the paper“Morning Miracle: Inside The Washington Post.” But that plan proved too costly.

Over the yearsThe Washington Post newsroom has been a destination for heads of statebusiness executives and Hollywood moguls and stars. An article in The Post in April 1975 about the filming of “All the President’s Men” said the newspaper allowed filmmakers to shoot only the building’s exterior. But film crews passed through repeatedly to “soak up authenticityrub elbows with newspaper people and learn the routine of a daily newspaper.”

Mr. Kindred recalled that when he was reporting his book between 2007 and 2009he rode an elevator with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.who had been visiting Donald E. GrahamMs. Graham’s son and chief executive of the Washington Post Company. Mr. Kindred also recalled a day when the actor Brad Pitt stopped by to glean inspiration for a movie he was working on.

“Everyone has passed through at one time or another,” said Mr. Kindred.

Newspapers around the country are trying to find ways to cut costs as they battle a troubled advertising environment and their readers migrate to digital news sources. The Post underwent a major shake-up last fall when Ms. Weymouth abruptly replaced the paper’s executive editorMarcus Brauchliwith Martin Baroneditor of The Boston Globe.

Andrew J. Asbilla Washington-based director of the capital markets group at Cushman & Wakefieldsaid that whoever purchased the headquarters would most likely tear it down and rebuild because it’s an older building and relatively far from the Metro.

Ms. Weymouth’s memo did not say where the company was looking to relocate.

 5685,  1985, a, ''THE LIVING PLANET: A Portrait of the Earth,'' the much acclaimed series from Britainarrives on public television Sunday night. In itDavid Attenborough looks at the worldand finds it inviting. In the first of 12 episodeshe shows us how the earth was formedhow continents movedand how flora and fauna proliferated. We have seen this on television beforeof coursebut Mr. Attenborough's series is special. For one thingit looks spectacular; for anotherthere is Mr. Attenboroughblessed with a quirky charm. The first episode''The Building of the Earth,'' will be seen on Channel 13 at 7 P.M.

Thus we begin in the Himalayasin the ''deepest valley in the world.'' Mr. Attenborough is our guidea job he takes seriously. We may not smell the rhododendrons in the valleybut certainly we know they're there. Mr. Attenboroughtrudging through the valleyis interested in everything: flowersmonkeystreespheasants with ''the burnished metallic iridescence of tropical butterflies,'' Sherpas plowing with yaks.

At the same timeit's the big picture he's after. How did these wonders come about? Mr. Attenborough stands on a hilltoppanting heavily. The thin air and the hike have gotten to him. We're concerned that he's all done in. Not to worryhowever; soon he is showing us a fossilized shell. He says it is a sign that the Himalayas were once under the sea.

Cut then to a great wall of flame. ''I'm in Iceland now,'' Mr. Attenborough says. He is standing in front of a volcanoand wind is ruffling his hair. Much of ''The Living Planet'' is full of transitions like that. We are on one continent and then another. Sometimes Mr. Attenborough follows; other times we just hear his voice. From Icelandwe go to Irelandand then to the Hebrides. We hear Mr. Attenborough all the whilealthough we don't see him again until Krakatoa.

 373,  2017, a, MONDAY PUZZLE — Crossword constructors are creative people andas a groupcan be very sensitive. It is for that reason that we need to cheer up Randall J. Hartmanbecause based on his themeI think he’s being hard on himself.

Sochin upMr. Hartman. There is some good stuff in your puzzle — I liked NERF GUN and the twin Superman clues — and you get to start off our solving week.

Today’s Theme

Mr. Hartman offers us a list set of phrases (I can’t really call them all “familiar” for reasons I’ll get into in a minute) in which the last word is a synonym for “failure.” For exampleat 17Awe have the clue “Air Force smart weapon” for LASER GUIDED BOMB. Similarlyat 43A“Thanksgiving entree” is ROAST TURKEY.

What surprised me was the inclusion of something as obscure as the FOSBURY FLOP at 25A. It’s a magnificent namebut if I had made this puzzleI’m not sure I would have put that in a Monday theme set. It’s a debut to The New York Times Crosswordand there may be a reason for that. How many people really know about “Pioneering high jump maneuvers” from the 1960s? Alsothe Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis movie from 1956their swan song “HOLLYWOOD OR BUST,” might not be well known to some solvers.

''Let us work another miracle by developing Korea into a model of political development deserving to be so recorded in world history,'' Mr. Chun said in a nationally broadcast address. ''We must not be content with having newly become a model of economic development.'' [ Excerptspage A8. ] Mr. Chun's acceptance of changerecommended unexpectedly on Monday by his designated successorsealed one of the most dramatic and sudden reversals of policy in South Korea's 39-year history. Gives In to Pressures

It was an action Mr. Chun clearly did not seekbut instead had forced upon him by a mixture of street protestsUnited States pressure and concern about the long-range consequences for the South Korean economy and the successful staging of the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. [ In WashingtonAdministration officials described a process of delicate maneuvering over the last few months to encourage the Seoul Government to accept a range of political initiatives. They said the United States had made it clear that it would not support any move by South Korean officials to resist such changes. Page A8. ]

Opposition leaders praised Mr. Chun's speech but cautioned that much remained to be done.

''This is the beginning of a new step for democracy in Korea,'' said Kim Young Sampresident of the main opposition groupthe Reunification Democratic Party. But Mr. Kim warned''From now onif something untoward should happenthe people would not forgive him.'' Overture to Protesters

 1039,  2013, a, TOUHEY--Carl E. A lifelong Albany businessmanpassed away on August 25th 2013 at the remarkable age of 95. Born in 1917 to Winifred and Charles Touheyhe was a graduate of the Albany Academy and Princeton University (1939). He ran a stunning race for Mayor of Albany in 1973 almost defeating the notorious Albany democratic machine. He was the President of Orange Motor Companywhich was founded by his fatherCharleson Friday the 13th 1916. Carl always chuckled at that dateadding"And we're still standingstill strong!" For over 75 years his various businesses provided employment for hundreds of Albany area families. A passionate philanthropisthe felt the responsibility to give back to his community. When asking others to do the samehe had an interesting strategy. He would say "How can I get big bucks from this guy? First I need to set the tone by stepping up myself." And he did. Some of his favorite organizations were more traditional ones such as Albany Medical CenterThe College of Saint Roseand Saratoga Performing Arts Center. But he also cared about smaller organizations like Capital Region Sponsor a Scholar and the 15 Love Youth Program both of which directly serve families in the community. He will be greatly missed by his wifeNancyand his childrenCharlesJohnLila MarieVirginiatheir spousesas well as the mother of his childrenLila L. Touheyand seven grandchildren and great grandchildren. Predeceased by his sisterAliceand his brotherFrankCarl was a surrogate father to their children as well as Nancy's many children and grandchildren.

Michelle SaleThe New York Times Learning Network

Javaid KhanThe Bank Street College of Education in New York City

Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Listen to a sample of a talk radio show to examine its purpose and format.

2. Examine newfound freedom on the air waves in Iraq by reading and discussing the article “Long StifledIraqis Make Most of Chance to Vent on Talk Radio.”

3. Research current hot topics for mock radio talks shows and present them in a future class.

4. Write reflective papers examining the role of avenues of public expression.

Resources / Materials:

-pens/pencils

-paper

-student journals

-classroom blackboard

-copies of the article “Long StifledIraqis Make Most of Chance to Vent on Talk Radio,” found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20040901wednesday.html (one per student)

-access to a news radio program (either taped prior to classlive on the radio or from a radio feed online)

-resources for researching globalnational and local current events (newspapersperiodicalscomputers with Internet access)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Prior to classteachers should set up a sample talk show for students to listen to while considering questions written on the board prior to class. Public radio feeds from a station such as National Public Radio (//www.npr.org) provide access to talk radio showssuch as the “Tavis Smiley Show,” “All Things Considered” and “Talk of the Nation.” As students enter the roominstruct them to listen to the audio clip as it is playedand then write in their journals in response to the following discussion questions (written on the board prior to class): “You are listening to a sample of a talk radio show. What is the format? What is the topic being discussed? Who are the various people talking on the air? What seems to be the purpose of the program?” After a few minutesallow students to share their answers. How does talk radio differ from television talk programs? Who do you think listens to it? Why might a person choose to listen to talk radio?

2. As a classread and discuss the article “Long StifledIraqis Make Most of Chance to Vent on Talk Radio,” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20040901wednesday.html) focusing on the following questions:

a. What is Radio Dijla?

b. What types of people listen to this station?

c. How many callson averagedoes this station receive in an hour?

d. What topics do people call in about?

e. According to Haidar al-Ameenwhy do the complaints of Iraqi citizens go unanswered?

f. How does the station involve the local and national government in its programs?

g. What issue was raised when local government leader Ali Laaibi was on the air?

h. Besides the frustrations of daily lifewhat other topic can people now speak publicly about?

i. What was the topic of a news program broadcast on June 302004?

j. Under Saddam Husseinwhat was the status of radio and radio stations?

k. What quality characterizes the staff at Radio Dijla?

l. What skills should Iraqis learnaccording to Imad al-Sharaa?

m. What other types of programs are on this station?

n. Why is the late-night show about relationships considered “racy”?

3. Explain that students will work in pairs to co-host mock radio shows focusing on an issue of current interest to students in their school. As a classgenerate a list of current concerns on the boardsuch as school uniformshonor codesthe war in Iraqglobal warmingetc.and then assign each pair a topic.

To prepare for the talk showexplain that each student in the pair should choose a position on the issue to research for the purpose of conducting an educated conversation from that point of view. (This viewpoint may or may not reflect the student’s true feelings about the issue. The important factor is that the student is informed and able to conduct an on-air debate with his or her “co-host” and field questions and comments from “callers.”) Questions to consider includebut are not limited tothe following (written on the board for easier student access): -What is the topic or issue you are researching?

-What are the various positions on this topic?

-Which position related to this topic will you be taking on your mock talk show program?

-How long has this topic been an issue?

-Who is most affected by this issue? Why?

-What people or groups are involved in this issue? Which ones haveor have the potential to havethe most power to bring about change with respect to this issue?

-What types of changes or solutions could be developed and implemented?

Once research is completedstudents should organize their research onto note cards for easy access during their mock news radio shows. Students should consider the information they want to present on their specific position and on related topicsas well as prepare for possible questions that “callers” (members of the class or audience) may ask them while “on the air.”

Additionallystudents may want to create titles for their talk shows and scripts to introduce their topicsas well as share with their co-hosts the viewpoints they have prepared to present.

In a future classgroups perform their mock talk shows on their assigned subjects and invite “callers” (classmates) to make comments and ask questions. Once presentations are completedthe class should evaluate which hosts and callers were most effective.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individuallystudents write reflection papers examining the importance of forums for public expression. Which forums are most valuable? Why? Which are most accessibleand to whom? Why? Other topics to reflect on: their experiences as talk show hosts; personal opinions about talk radio shows; whether they would feel comfortable calling in to a ‘real’ show; etc.

Further Questions for Discussion:

-How did Saddam Hussein control the media in Iraq?

-Why did the Swedish government take an interest in helping to start Radio Dilja?

-Why is education a valued quality in democratic societies?

-What happens when people are not allowed to voice their opinions?

-How do you make your own opinions heard? Do you feel these are meaningfulproductive avenues for you? Why or why not?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on participation in initial class discussion and subsequent conversationsresearchpresentation of mock talk shows and thoughtfully written reflection papers.

Vocabulary:

stifledventinsurgencymeritpersistsewagetaintroyaltysupplicantsfranticexecutedinsurgencyroiledinterimcensoredhejabsoptimismrepressionclericsracyadherencebetrayal

Extension Activities:

1. Choose a pressing domestic issue that has surfaced in Iraq since Saddam Hussein’s regime ended. Research one of these issuessuch as garbage disposal or water contaminationand write an article explaining the current issueits history and its future status.

2. Create a plan for a one-hourcommercial-free radio music show. What would your play list be? What topics would you discuss? What types of introductions or comments would you make? Present your plan to the classincluding a short sample.

3. Write a position paper examining the importance of the media and the information it disseminates in democratic nationsand consider the effect of censorship in such countries as RussiaChinaCuba or Iraq. Why do dictatorships fight so hard to control information?

4. Research the most popular local radio stations. What types of programs do they offer? Why do you think these stations are so popular in your community? Create a poster illustrating your findings. Include suggestions for new radio stationsif you believe a population or need is not being served by the current choices available.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Civics – Research the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)taking into consideration a controversial issue that involved this organization (such as the Janet Jackson scandal at the 2004 Super Bowl or Rush Limbaugh’s ESPN commentary about race in football)and write a research paper about your findings. How does the FCC operate? Who runs it? Does the FCC seem to have a political leaning? What impact does the FCC have on radio and television coverage?

Geography – Create a topographical map of Iraqhighlighting the major geographical features that have shaped this nation.

Health – Design a presentation illustrating the benefits of talking and speaking your mind. Examine various forums for expressionincluding support groupshotlineschat roomspsychologistsetc.

Technology -Create a “How it Works” poster explaining how a radio station operates.

-According to the article“The station [Radio Dijla] receives an average of 185 calls an hourfar more than it can handle ….” How many calls can a phone line handle? What determines phone line capacity? What services can a phone company offer a business that has a high call volume? What types of phone systems are necessary? How are calls answered? Put on hold? Write a brief report about your findings.

Teaching with The Times – Clip the letters to the editor on the editorial page of The New York Times for a week. What topics and articles are the published letters about? What viewpoints are represented? How do the letter writers identify themselves? How does The Times compare with the radio talk shows you listened to as a forum for public expression?

 1576,  2010, a, MILAN – If Chris Mullin ever becomes a Knicks executiveas has long been speculatedhe will surely be thrilled with the roster he inherits.

Mullin came to Italy this week to help the N.B.A. promote the Knicks’ exhibition game against Armani Jeans Milano. On Fridayhe presided over a 3-point contest on the plaza next to the Duomo and later participated in a community service event.

Donnie Walshthe Knicks presidenthas long been fond of Mullinwho once played for Walsh’s Indiana Pacers. There are persistent rumors that Walsh wants to hire Mullin but has been blocked by team ownership.

Mullin skirted the speculation on Friday but he enthusiastically praised the work Walsh has done to revitalize the Knicks.

“I think it’s been pretty dramaticactually,” Mullin told a handful of New York reporters. “Now you’ve got to wait and see how it is on the court. But they’ve made a lot of changes. ObviouslyAmar’e is a huge part of that.”

Walsh stripped the roster over the last two years to clear salary-cap roomwith LeBron James as the primary target. When James chose MiamiWalsh landed Amar’e Stoudemireone of the top big men in the leaguethen filled out the roster with a number of promising playersincluding Raymond FeltonAnthony RandolphRoger MasonKelenna Azubuike and Timofey Mozgov.

“I don’t know anyone who could have done a better job than he’s done already,” Mullin said. “The work he did to get under the capto be in the position he was last summerand then to get Amar’ethat’s the way you do it. You always have a planand Donniewherever he’s beenthere’s no mistakehis teams have gradually gotten better.”

Mullin said that Stoudemire’s presence would make a huge differenceparticularly for talented young players like Wilson Chandler and Danilo Gallinari.

“When you have a team of good playersalmost on a daily basis you’re kind of scouring around to see where the pyramid falls into place,” said Mullina former Golden State Warriors general manager. “When you get a key guy like Amar’enot only does it help situate your teamI think it helps the other guys focus on what they do best. Sometimes when you don’t have that marquee guyyou try to do more than you’re capable of doing.”

Needless to sayMullin is also optimistic about the future of Randolph. Mullinafter alldrafted him for the Warriors in 2008. Randolph is fantastically athletic but unpolished. He has been slowed by injuries.

“His talent is incredible,” Mullin said. “He’s a hard workerhe’s a good kid. Careers take different paths. He was injured last year. But what I saw of him in practicehis potential is pretty high. Sometimes that’s dangerousbecause there is so much talent there. But I think once he gets into a stable situationhe’ll do really well.”

As for his own futureMullin said he wanted to return to an N.B.A. front office eventuallybut was in no rush. He said he had had no recent discussions with Walsh.

“I’ve been doing a lot for the N.B.A. Taking these trips has been great,” he said. “So for methe right situation comes upI would definitely look at it. But I’m not really struggling with what I’m doing. I’m pretty happy. So nono real time frame on that.”

 1178,  2012, a, DETROIT — Joe Torre managed Russell Martin for three seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers. But his phone call to Martinthe Yankees’ catcheron Thursday was not to say hello or ask about his Carolina blue sneakers.

As major league baseball’s executive vice president for baseball operationsTorre is responsible for discipline and umpiring. Torre wanted to hear Martin’s version of the snit with the plate umpire Laz Diaz on Wednesday night in Anaheimwhen Martin questioned some pitches and Diaz declined to hand him new baseballs to throw back to the pitcher. Martin claimed Diaz told him he had to earn the privilege.

Martin said he returned Torre’s call Friday before the Yankees faced the Tigers at soggy Comerica Park. Torre had already spoken to DiazMartin said.

“He wanted to hear both sides of the story,” Martin said. “It’s not a major issue. It’s more childish than anything else.”

Yankees Manager Joe Girardia former catchersaid Friday he had never heard of an umpire penalizing a catcher in that way. “I’m glad it’s over withjust kind of let the league handle it,” Girardi said. “I know Russell was frustrated by it. Let it dieand we’ll move onand the league will handle it the way they’re going to handle it.”

Martin likes to toss new balls to the mound to keep his arm looseespecially with men on base. Girardi understood why Martin made an issue of it. “It’s a guy’s personal preference,” he said. “As athletesvery seldom are we going to back downeither.”

It is not clear whether Torre might discipline Diaz for his actions or Martin for speaking out. Martin brought up the conflict with reporters after the game without being asked about it. He used an expletive in referring to Diazand his comments included“I know he can hold a grudge with the best of them.”

FridayGirardi brushed off questions about possible reprisals by Diaz or other umpires.

“We may not see him for three months,” Girardi said. “I’m not concerned. And I’m sure baseball will watchand he understands thattoo.”

Said Martin: “I just hope to get to throw the ball back to pitcher next time. I don’t think it’s going to be an issueunless you guys write about it every day.”

Young Returns to New York The last time the Yankees and the Tigers metin late April at Yankee StadiumDelmon Young spent the entire series on the restricted list after being arrested in the early morning April 27. Young was charged with aggravated harassmenta misdemeanorafter an altercation with four men outside the New York Hilton Hotel in midtown.

The Tigers had flown in from Detroit the night of the 26th after a day game at Comerica Park. The police said an apparently intoxicated Young yelled an anti-Semitic remark and tackled one of the men. The Tigers put Young on the restricted list the next day. He later drew a seven-day suspension without pay from Major League Baseball and apologized for his conduct.

Girardi said Robertson was supposed to play catch Thursday but could not because of rain.

Season 5Episode 5

Who would have guessedAbbots? Robert Crawley (Hugh Bonneville)the Earl of Granthamgreat man of Yorkshireveteran of the Boer Warmember of one of the most distinguished peerages in the land … knows how to pimp slap.

Now it may not get him much play time in the Super Bowl — or even a stint as backup dominatrix to Katy Perry. But it sure comes in handy when he enters his bedchamber to find his wife Cora (Elizabeth McGovern) in some kind of intimate talking situation with her purring esthete suitorSimon Bricker (the already-to-be-missed Richard E. Grant). Both Cora and Bricker are still standing and clothed and not noticeably perspiringbut Earl G. rightly surmises that the conversation has moved beyond Piero della Francesca.

But we knew it was comingdidn’t weAbbots? As soon as Robert said he was guest of honor at … some dinner for … officers … ohI don’t know — the point was he was going to be gonedefinitively goneon the night in questionand by the time he said thatAbbots — by the third timeI mean — didn’t you grasp as clearly as Daisy (Sophie McShera) now grasps the basic facts of English history that he would come back a little bit early? And find his wife and Bricker in their dressing gowns?

Brickerto his creditdoesn’t back down. “When you chose to ignore a woman like Corayou must have known that not every man would be as blind as you.” No wonder Earl G. gives him the back of his hand! Before you know itthey’re tussling all over the bed and floor. It’s not exactly a saloon brawl; if anythingthe Earlin his regimental costumeresembles a very large red sofa that has unexpectedly tumbled on a guest and is slowly squeezing the life out of him.

Sanity prevailsand Bricker exits the next morning with as much dignity as he can muster. I wonder if he hasn’t discovered a new career path: bringing the healing

glow of flirtation to neglected aristo-wives. I could see women paying good money for that therapeutic servicebut the therapyunfortunatelyhas yet to kick in with the Crawleys. When last seenRobert was giving Cora a cold shoulder perfected over centuries of English winters. Isisyou bitchyou’ve won.

Wellwe’re used to Robert and his epic sulksaren’t we? And if Episode 5 is about anythingit’s the fragility of the male ego.

Just look at how far women have to bend to preserve the amour-propre of the house butler. When Mrs. Patmore (Lesley Nicol) gets a small inheritance from a dead auntCarson (Jim Carter) is the first one she turns to for investment advice. Of coursehe does nothing more than pass on secondhand knowledge from Earl G. and pretend he knows the difference between publicly and privately held corporationsso why’d she even bother? “Because he’s a manI suppose.”

And when she ultimately uses the money to buy a cottageCarson gets very snippy indeed: “This is very small beer.” “It’s my kind of beer,” retorts Mrs. P“and I know how to drink it.” But recognizing just how far she can pushshe immediately relapses to “It’s good to hear advice from a man of the world.” In sidles that minx Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis Logan): “We feel thoroughly protected.”

Protectedyes. That’s what Bates (Brendan Coyle) wants Anna (Joanne Froggatt) to feel. “Nothing bad is ever going to happen to you again,” he declares. “We’ll sit by the fire with all our children around usand I’ll make certain that you’re safe.” Annahaving had some hands-on experience with contraceptive packagesedges away from that Duggars-y vision: “I’m not sure about having children all around us.” But let’s be honestwhat’s she really thinking? DudeI’ve been pulling your chestnuts out of the fire from the day we met. I’ll be doing it till the day we die. Who’s keeping whom safe here?

MeanwhileTom Branson (Allen Leech) has been enjoying the ego-boosting and almost Hegelian experience of two historical forces vying for his soul. On one side: the prickly Tory gentility of Earl G. On the other: the hair-trigger Socialism of Sarah Bunting (Daisy Lewis). Once more I had to remind myself that Sarah and Tom were supposed to be warm for each other — there’s never been much on-screen evidence — so I was in no way surprised to see Sarah get the Classic Male Brushoff. “Maybe we should call it a day,” says Tom. “Before one of us gets hurt.” Thenanswering the silent prayers of a million viewershe packs her off to Lancashire with a chaste kiss and four passionateheart-thrumming words: “I’m glad we met.” A gushing romantic soul to the endour Tom.

Best scene: That richly realized encounter between Violetthe Dowager Countess(Maggie Smith) and Dr. Clarkson (David Robb)in which she struggles to define the change that has come over her frenemy Isobel (Penelope Wilton). “I do not know who she is. I do not know what it is she wants.”

“Are you saying you liked her better when she was more middle class?” the doctor asks.

“I wouldn’t go that far,” snaps Violetbefore conjuring up the specter of Isobel’s marriage to Lord Merton (Douglas Reith). “Do you wish to see her live a life devoid of industry and moral worth? A hollow existence in a large and drafty house with a man who bores her to death?”

Hard not to hear Violet describing her own marriage down to a teebut thanks to the deft playing of Dame Maggie and Mr. Robbthe melancholy stays just beneath the surface — as does the curious possibility that Isobel is the best friend Violet has ever had.

Best line: So many to choose fromAbbots! I will admit to a giggle at Carson’s “Now if you’ll allow meI will go up and ring the gong.” (Is that what they’re calling it these days?) Andyesa gut-wrenching guffaw at Rose’s “I give tea to some Russian refugees every Tuesday and Thursday. They love cake.” (Is that what they’re calling it these days?) But for metime stopped in the most pleasant possible way when Violetupon learning that someone has launched a nudist colony in Essexexclaims: “In Essex? Isn’t it terribly damp?” To be honestshe had me at Essexthat’s how good Dame Maggie is. I never had the privilege of seeing her as Oscar Wilde’s Lady Bracknell on the London stagebut I fully believe she would have brought the same killer inflection to “A handbag?”

This week’s drinking game: A long swig of Guinness any time a characterupstairs or downspeaks of the difficulty and/or necessity of change. Who am I kidding? That’s the Season 5 drinking game.

Department of other stuff….

* OhRose. Dearsweetvivaciousnot-the-sharpest-arrow-in-the-quiver Rose (Lily James). When a young man tells you he has “a bit of Russian blood,” it’s not—wellit’s really not the thing to squeal “How extraordinary!” Becauseof courseit’s not extraordinaryis it? Russia being a rather big country with millions of people. You — you do see thatdon’t youRose?

WellI suppose one benefit of having such an unfurnished head is that no prejudice can take root thereso off you go with your Jewish boyfriend. Spit spot! And may this transgressive love affair end more happily than the last one.

* Are you not relishing the light note of savagery that Mabel Lane Fox (Catherine Steadman) brings to the mix? And what a delightfully tense meal with Mary Crawley (Michelle Dockery). Is it wrong to wish they both kicked their men to the curb and ran off together for a scandalous Sapphic weekend? In Essex? (At least they wouldn’t have to worry about contraception.)

* Under the influence of his mad-scientist drugsHissing Thomas (Rob James-Collier) is looking particularly Kabuki this week — or else he’s auditioning for the Yorkshire Little Theater production of “Sweeney Todd.” Ten to one he faceplants in somebody’s soup.

* Am I alone in being horrified by the plot to snatch Marigold from her adoptive mother and pop her in some French school? Last I checkedthat was called kidnapping. “But what else are we to do?” asks Violet. I dunno … leave the kid where she is and tell your granddaughter to get a life? Sheesh.

So speakAbbots. Will the Marigold abduction come to pass? And just whom is Edith (Laura Carmichael) phoning at episode’s end? Will the Russian refugees develop diabetic shock? Are Isobel and Violet ever going to finish that jigsaw puzzle? Will Mrs. Patmore’s humble little cottage become the stepping stone to a hospitality empire that reduces Downton to luxury guest villas?

Most urgentlyare we to believe recent tabloid reports that next season will be “Downton’s” last? No confirmation as yetbut end times may be here before we know it. TrembleAbbots.

Next week!

But throughout the ups and downshe’s been able to turn to the Cleveland Cavaliers superstar LeBron James for advice. James started talking with Pryor last year to try to help him cope with his youthful fame.

The two have not spoken recentlybut Pryor said that James had preached to him about the importance of taking advantage of opportunities like his eighth-ranked team’s game Friday against No. 7 Oregon in the 96th Rose Bowl.

“Every game is a stage,” Pryor said. “This is a big stage. We have to perform better on big stages.”

Three years ago at Sony Classical recordsa group of executives sat around a table and glumly contemplated the shrinking market for classical music. In the Ice-T agewhat would it take to create some sizzle around Schubert?

The solution was Masterworks Dinner Classicsa series of compact disks and tapes matched to national cuisines and to specific eating scenarioswith suggested recipes as part of the package.

The marketing plan was simple. Style the art to suggest a food and entertaining magazine. Sign on Martha Stewart for the recipes. Place the disks and tapes in bookstoresright next to the cookbooksand in specialty food stores and cookware stores.

 2145,  2007, a, MORGANTOWNW. Va. — For West Virginiathe most important fan among the 60,000 in attendance tonight will be Terrelle Pryora Pennsylvania high school quarterback. He’s the consensus No. 1 player in the country and seemingly an ideal fit for the Mountaineers’ spread offense. Pryor is most often compared to the former Texas quarterback Vince Young and has narrowed the list of universities recruiting him to Ohio StateWest VirginiaFloridaPenn State and Tennessee.

In this interesting diary in The Pittsburgh Post GazettePryor talks about how he’s rooting for W.V.U. and O.S.U. to play in the title game. Pryor is 6-foot-6225 pounds and as prolific a thrower as he is a runner. He was scheduled to play in a playoff game this afternoon for Jeannette High School and make it in time for kickoff.

The West Virginia staff couldn’t have scripted a better environment for Pryor’s visit. The atmosphere here is expected to be the best in the history of the state. If you don’t believe the hype on Pryorpick your poison on these You Tube clips. You don’t need to be Tom Lemming to see Pryor’s boundless potential.
 1938,  2008, a, Josh Beckett was the last Red Sox player to reach the field before Game 1 of the division series against the Angels. Beckett was one of the first players to leave the field before the pregame drills were over. As Beckett entered and exitedhe did not speak to reporters about his strained oblique muscle.

Beckettwho is one of the best postseason pitchers of his generationwas supposed to start the opener. But Beckett strained his oblique during a throwing session last Friday and is tentatively scheduled to pitch Game 3 on Sunday.

While Manager Terry Francona has been optimistic about Beckett’s situationthe Red Sox are still uncertain he will be able to pitch. Beckett has a bullpen session scheduled for Thursday’s off day. If Beckett throws without difficulties and does not have any trouble Fridayhe could start Sunday.

Francona would not call Beckett “a lock” to start because he did not think that word was appropriate. After Beckett long tossed from 150 feet WednesdayFrancona said the bigger test will come Thursday.

“Nowif everything goes O.K.he’ll throw his side tomorrowbut we reserve the right to make a change if we don’t think it’s in his best interest physically,” Francona said. “But he had a real good last couple of daysand today was another good day.”

If Beckett cannot pitchBoston would start Paul Byrd or the knuckleballer Tim Wakefield. Beckett was 4-0 with a 1.20 earned run average as the Red Sox rumbled to the World Series title last season. Not having Beckett at all would obviously impair Boston’s chances to repeat as champions.
 3250,  2000, a, If Vice President Al Gore has counted on anything in this tumultuous political seasonit is that the strong economy will give him the upper hand in the general election should he win the Democratic presidential nomination.

The economy remains as strong as ever. But Mr. Gore's strategy for using it to his advantage would have to change -- and could in the end prove to be less potent -- if his Republican opponent turned out to be Senator John McCain rather than Gov. George W. Bush.

To Mr. Gore's teamMr. Bushwho until a few weeks ago seemed to have a lock on his party's nominationis in many ways the ideal rival. The centerpiece of the Texan's campaign has been his big tax cuta proposal that Mr. Gore's advisers are certain they could label fiscally irresponsiblea threat to Social Security and a gamble with the current prosperity.

When it comes to economic issuesMr. McCain presents a smallermore elusive target. While he supports tax cutsthey are of a scale closer to those advocated by Mr. Gore. Like President Clinton and the vice presidentMr. McCain emphasizes that saving Social Security is his first goal. And like the administrationhe promotes the long-term benefits of reducing the national debt.

 7483,  1964, a, BERLINJuly 31 — Premier Khrushchev may be ready to offer a slight modification of the Soviet stand on Berlin as a goodwill gesture to pave the way for a meeting with Chancellor Ludwig Erhard of West Germanyinformed sources said today.

The move would involve acceptance by the Soviet Union of the inclusion of West Berlin in a new trade agreement between West Germany and the Soviet Union. This would amount to a tacit recognition of Bonn's formal economic ties with West Berlin.

The sources recalledhoweverthat the Soviet leader was reported to have reassured Welter UlbrichtCommunist chief of East Germanyin Warsaw last week that the Soviet Union did not contemplate any other changes on Germany and the country's reunification.

Above allMr. Khrushchev was said to have stressed his determination to maintain the Russian stand of two separate Germanys that must come to terms with each other in direct negotiations. The West has repeatedly rejected such suggestions as unworkable.

 4560,  1992, a, Mitchell D. Schweitzerwho retired in 1972 as a New York State Supreme Court Justice after more than 26 years on various benches in New York City courtsdied on Monday at the Jersey Shore Medical Center in NeptuneN.J. A former resident of ManhattanJudge Schweitzer was 86 years old and lived in WaysideN.J.

His death was caused by congestive heart failurehis family said.

Judge Schweitzer made his reputation with a keen legal mind leavened by a sense of humor. He also was known as one of the hardest working judges in New Yorksetting records for the swift disposition of cases. Probe Into Fitness

He abruptly left the bench in January 1972 to halt a judicial inquiry into his fitness to preside at court. That investigation began after Federal and state official had started looking into his friendship with Nathan Voloshenan accused swindler who pleaded guilty in 1970 to charges of conspiracy to defraud Federal agencies. Judge Schweitzer denied each allegation and none of them was proven. Earlierin 1959Judge Schweitzer was publicly criticized in some of the news media for refusing to make public a grand jury presentment regarding rigged television-quiz showsa subject rife with publicity.

"I've been called a thief and a crook and those things are never pleasant," he said in defending himself at the time. "But my first duty is to the law and to my conscience. I can be guided only by what the law tells me.
 3901,  1997, a, With the clock ticking down until Election Day and new polls showing that her re-election remains in doubtGov. Christine Todd Whitman turned her attention today to some of her softer areas of supportgiving a speech on personal responsibility that seemed intended to appease social conservatives in the Republican Party and expressing her solidarity with minority voters who traditionally favor Democrats.

Mrs. Whitmanwhose positions in favor of abortion and gay rights have alienated some fellow Republicanstold hundreds of teen-agers at Cedar Grove High School in Cedar Grove that she wanted to begin a dialogue with children in New Jersey about the importance of choosing between right and wrong.

Alluding to a number of widely publicized crimes by teen-agers in New Jersey over the last yearMrs. Whitman said''We as adults have not been doing a very good job of communicating to you and the people coming up after you about consequences and responsibility.

''When you make a decision and take an actionthere are going to be consequences,'' she said.

LaterMrs. Whitman stood on a dais outside the Oak Avenue School in Orangea relatively poor city that has traditionally been a Democratic strongholdand accepted endorsements from several local black leaders.
 2578,  2004, a, Marines withdrew Friday from most of the positions they had taken during the three-week siege of this cityas the American military began handing over control of security here to an Iraqi general under Saddam Hussein and up to 1,100 men under his command.

Marines abandoned buildings and bulldozed earthworks in southern and western neighborhoods of the city as the former major generalJasim Muhammad Salehrolled into town wearing his old uniform with its crossed swords and eagle on the epaulets. Hundreds of residents cheered him along the streetssome waving the old Iraqi flag.

In a country where tribal loyalties are by far the most powerful allegianceit is unclear whether support of the occupation forces or national interests can supersede those or whether the Iraqi force will be willing or able to fight the insurgents.

Gen. John P. Abizaidthe commander of American forces in the Middle Eastcautioned in a teleconference from Qatar that the entry of the Iraqi soldiers would not necessarily quell the insurgency anytime soon. ''I think that we should be very careful in thinking that this effort to build this Iraqi capacity will necessarily calm down the situation in Falluja tonight or over the next several days,'' he said. ''It's a step-by-step effort that will have to include a clear understanding of the security situation.''[Page A6.]

 5602,  1986, a, CBS Newsagain retooling its morning news program after years of ratings failurewill not renew the contracts of Maria Shriver and Forrest Sawyer as co-anchors of the ''CBS Morning News,'' according to network officials.

In factthe ''CBS Morning News'' in its present form will cease to exist by fallwhen CBS plans to implement a new type of broadcast in the morning time period. That new programto be outlined to CBS affiliates in two weeksis planned as a radical departure from the traditional news program formatand will probably not be named ''Morning News.''

While the three networks' morning programs traditionally have been based in New Yorkwith a male and a female anchorplans for the new CBS program call for a regional formatwith hosts in Los Angeles and possibly Chicago and Dallasas well as New Yorkaccording to CBS News executives who asked that their names not be used.

Ms. Shriver has been asked by the network to accept the position in Los Angelesbut she has not yet agreed to do so. Mr. Sawyer will seek reassignment within CBS News. He has been alternating as anchor of the ''CBS Weekend News'' in addition to his morning post. Other Departures From Form

Before or after you votehere are a few random thoughts to mull about today’s puzzle:

It’s hard to fill in PARDON MY FRENCH and not smile.

Why is a cowpuncher called a cowpuncher? Punch can mean to drive cattle by prodding. Similarlymen who prodded cattle onto railcars with long sticks were most likely the original cowpokes.

“Letter-writing prisonerperhaps” works two ways for PEN PAL.

Interesting that such a short wordSEThas the longest entry in the Oxford English Dictionary. The online version has 33 listings for the verb alone. The longest wordpneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosismakes up for that with its very short entry.

QEII looks more like a Star Wars monarch than a British one.

We need a new crop of people named ARI. “Exodus hero” is fineas are all the other ARI-clue peoplebut they’re a bit tired. The EVA clue pool has fared much better in recent yearsthanks to a number of fairly well-known actresses and “Model Herzigova.”

Does LIED TO match the clue “Told fibs”? Will Shortz points to this substitution: “He told me fibs” and “He lied to me.”

Bill Withers’s Use Me peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard chart in 1972after his No. 1 hit Lean on Me that same year. Trying to picture Bill WithersI mixed him up with Johnny Wintertwo people who couldn’t look more different. Here are his two 1972 hits:
 4846,  1991, a, The womanwho said the initials C. J. are not her ownsaid she felt no remorse. "I blame it on menperiod," she saidadding"I'm doing it to all the men because it was a man that gave it to me."

During the interviewMr. Johnson repeatedly urged the woman to seek counseling. She continues to call himhe said Thursday. Once she told him she contracted the AIDS virus from a white bisexual manhe said. He said he arranged for her to talk with a ministerbut "I don't think we have made a lot of headway with her."

Some people who call Mr. Johnson argue that C. J.'s story is a hoax.

Charles O'Nealpublisher of The Dallas Examinera weekly newspaper whose readership is largely blacksaid that though no one can be sure whether it is a hoax he believes that the story has stirred intense public discussion among blacks about heterosexual AIDS transmission. "I am certain there is some communitywide consternation that C. J. is one of a number of people who are out there wreaking havoc with this disease," he said.

Health officials said the number of heterosexual men seeking information about AIDS has greatly increased in recent weeks in Dallas County.

"In the pastpeople seemed to be a lot more judgmental about people who get this disease," said Phillip Mathewsdirector of minority services at the AIDS Interfaith Network. "Now they are showing serious concern because it could hit very close to home. C. J. could be a blessingin a sad sort of way."

At R. J.'s on the Lakea fashionable disco on Dallas's northwest sidethe managerJerry Sanderssaid business was as brisk as ever but "people's attitudes about high-risk behavior have changed enormouslythanks to C. J." Drop in Promiscuity

Many of those at the bar agreed. "If what this woman says is truewe are talking about a form of genocide," said Levi Peterson 3da 32-year-old accountant. "It is serial killing. But true or notpromiscuity has de-elevatedbelieve me."
 4471,  1993, a, Dressed as bride and groomHema Sakhrani and Shaleen Wadhwani were mourned yesterday as they lay a few feet from each other in a funeral parlor in Queens. She wore a red sari with gold trim that her uncle had brought from Bombay. He wore a bejeweled turban and a black suit. An orange sasha symbol of the bond between man and woman in Hindu marriage ritesjoined the two coffins.

Their parents held two services for the young couplewhose lives had seemed so promising until a man who the police said was obsessed with Miss Sakhrani gunned down Mr. Wadhwani last Wednesday. She was so overcome by grief that she killed herself two days later.

Early yesterday morningthere was a kind of wedding ceremony. Laterseveral hundred relatives and friends crowded into the same room for the funeral. July Wedding Was Planned

Mr. Wadhwani and Miss Sakhraniboth 20were students at New York University who fell in love and planned to marry on July 16. He was about to start medical school on a full scholarship. She excelled in chemistry. Their parentsimmigrants from India and Pakistanreveled in their children's happiness.
 2305,  2006, a, Wellhere are the latest poll resultsaccording to Adam Nagourney and Megan Thee:

A substantial majority of Americans expect Democrats to reduce or end American military involvement in Iraq if they win control of Congress next Tuesdayand say Republicans would maintain or increase troop levels to try to win the war if they hold on to power on Capitol Hillaccording to the final New York Times/CBS News poll before the midterm election.

The poll found that just 29 percent of Americans approve of the way President Bush is managing the war in Iraqmatching the lowest mark of his presidency. Nearly 70 percent of Americans said Mr. Bush did not have a plan to end the warand an overwhelming 80 percent said Mr. Bush’s latest effort to rally public support for the conflict amounted to a change in language but not policy.

The poll underlined the extent to which the war has framed the midterm elections. Americans cited Iraq as the most important issue affecting their voteand majorities of Republicans and Democrats said they wanted a change in the government’s approach to the war. Only 20 percent said they thought the United States was winning in Iraqdown from a high of 36 percent in January.

 4389,  1994, a, Bernadette Castrothe Republican candidate for United States Senatesaid yesterday that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani tried to persuade her during a private meeting at Gracie Mansion on Sunday night to "consider distancing" herself from her party's gubernatorial candidateGeorge E. Pataki.

Ms. Castroa long-time friend and financial contributor to the Mayortold reporters at an impromptu news conference on Fifth Avenue that she refused. "I'm a member of the Republican ticket," she said. "George Pataki is the head of the ticket. If I didn't think he would be a good governorI wouldn't have joined the ticket in the first place."

Providing a glimpse of the behind-the-scenes wrangling inside the Republican PartyMs. Castro attributed the Mayor's decision to cross party lines and support Gov. Mario M. Cuomoa Democratto his long-running tensions with Senator Alfonse M. D'Amatowho helped engineer Mr. Pataki's candidacy.

"Lookwe're all grownups in this," she saidcontending that the real dispute was not between Mr. Pataki and Mr. Giuliani. "It's between Alfonse and Rudy. That's what it's all about. Rudy doesn't want Alfonse controlling the Republican Party."

 4144,  1995, a, After the Federal agents finished their intensive searchafter the Ted Koppel town meetingafter the small army of reporters had gone and without a single television camera left to record the eventthe women here did what they always do when someone is in trouble: they put on a fund-raising supper.

It was held tonight at the Lamotte Township Fire Hallas such suppers usually arebut this time it was not for anyone they knew. It was for the survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing.

In the past weeksimilar fund-raisers have undoubtedly been organized in thousands of small towns across America. But Deckera conservative Republican area about 100 miles north of Detroitin Michigan's rural "thumb" region and has one post officeone bar and 90 peopleis not just another sleepy small community anymore. It is the place where James and Terry Nicholswho are being held as material witnesses in the Oklahoma City bombingare accused of conspiring to make explosives with Timothy McVeighthe primary suspect in the blast in Oklahoma City.

In its own waythe fund-raising supper tells more about places like Decker than all the television specialsand the camera crews that have flooded the area since Federal agents blocked off the Nichols farm and began searching for explosives. If there were members of paramilitary groups present they didn't call attention to themselves. There were quite a few farmers dressed in work clotheswho had driven through high winds and a cold rain.

 2281,  2006, a, Less than two months agomarketing company Valassis Communications was pitching the virtues of its $1.3 billion acquisition of Advoa direct-mail concern. But the transaction has since collapsed in a hailstorm of recriminations between the two companiesillustrating how a relatively straightforward deal can go veryvery wrong.

Valassis’s allegations are blunt. It claims that Advo misrepresented its financial health during the negotiations and withheld negative information until after the deal was announced. As a resultit says it has the right to cancel the merger agreement.

Advo was not shy in its responseeither. In a letter sent to Valassis’s board of directors dated Aug. 29 and made public on Fridayit said Valassis was “suffering from a severe case of ‘buyer’s remorse'” and noted that Valassis’s share price plunged after the transaction was made public. Advo also compared Valassis’s behavior to that of Tyson Foodswhich famously tried to terminate its agreement to acquire IBP. In a landmark ruling in 2001a Delaware court ruled against Tysonforcing it to consummate the deal.

Valassis made its case in a complaint filed Wednesday in Delaware’s Court of Chancery. Though the document was filed under sealValassis has since released a redacted version that makes for intriguing readingas long as you are not afraid of some legalese.

The complaint describes an on-and-off negotiation process between Valassisadvised by Bear Stearnsand Advoadvised by Citigroup. It culminated in a “go/no go” meeting on June 30 in Bostonattended by top executiveslawyers and investment bankers on both sides. They walked away with an agreement for Valassis to buy Advo for $37 per share in cash.

After the deal was announced on July 6however“the truth begins to emerge,” Valassis said in the complaint.

Exactly what emerged? It is hard to say: What follows is a series of redacted pages with tantalizing section headers such as “Valassis Obtains Board Minutes Revealing Advo’s Knowledge of the Fraud.”

Valassis said it tried to conduct further due diligence but ran into “unreasonable restrictions.” Relations between the two companies grew strainedValassis suggests:

On Aug. 172006Eric Stovall of KPMG visited Advo’s corporate headquarters and was met by Mr. HutterHal ManoianAdvo’s director of accountingand Kirkpatrick & Lockhartcounsel for Advo. Mr. Stovall was told that the general ledger would be made available only on a read-only basis and that Advo would not answer questions unless the questions were put in writing. […] Because Mr. Stovall was not permitted to download the general ledgersuch that he could manipulate and/organize the ledger entriesit was impossible for him to analyze the data in any meaningful way.

In its letterAdvo disputed the notion that it has been putting up roadblocks. It said it has provided Valassis with “reasonable access” to its books in the past month — but perhaps not the “full and unfettered access” that Valassis had demanded.

 4449,  1993, a, If Thursday's concert by Nicolas CollinsJoel RyanRay Edgar and the Soldier String Quartet at the Kitchen had a collective messageit was similar to the one that music has been getting recently from the downtown school of electricity. The traditional artistic process is upended: no more the stepwise progression from materials to technique to beautiful object; now the art is in the materials themselves. How they are organized is anticlimax.

Midway through the eveningMr. Ryan unwound wire across the stageplugged it into a terminal and strolled back and forthmanipulating its length and rubbing it with a bow. Synthetically generated metaphors for human gesture and man-made sounds boomed and creaked from loudspeakers. The process was repeated a little later through the proximity of hand-held objects to various microphones.

This dialogue between man and machine had been introduced a few minutes before in Mr. Collins's "Broken Light," in which fragments of the Italian Baroque are electronically acceleratedspit out and responded to by the Soldier's four players. Whether by accident or on purposethere was more a sense of music here than in the two Collins items that came before. "Lightning Strikes Not Once but Twice" and "Sound for Picture," two vignettes on the blind and the deafseemed more interesting for their narratives than for the bland electronic sound behind them.

Mr. Edgar's "Flexsonica II" found the performerhands wired for soundbending and caressing a metal bar. Herean engineer of sorts happily shared empirical discoveries in sound. This Cybertronics series continues on April 16 and 17. Brush up on your applied science. This is a little like a visit to a new-inventions fair.
 5863,  1984, a, Every morningby the dawn's early lightthousands of starlings take off from their perches in the magnolia trees around the White House. They fly to Virginia and Maryland to spend the day on the jobwhich is mostly eating bugs and worms.

At the twilight's last gleaming these reverse commuters fly back home to the White House.

They are hardly welcome there because of the mess and noise they makeespecially around the patio of the South Porticofacing the Mall.

The birds have outlasted all attempts at evictionbut Irvin Williamsthe chief horticulturist of the White Housesays he has not given up. ''You can watch them any morning or night,'' said Mr. Williams. ''They fly over Tyson's Corner by the thousands on the way to and from feeding in the countryside.''

Mr. Williams said that about a year ago he heard that snakes would scare the birds away. He put two inflated toy snakes in the branches of two magnolia trees. ''It worked for about two weeks,'' he said. ''Then they realized the snakes weren't doing them any harmso they came back and just ignored the snakes.''
 3866,  1997, a, To the outside worldhoweverthe girl in the modest-maiden dresses and modified bowl hairdo had been transformed into a poised and elegant fashion plate whose every style change influenced the way women around the well-dressed world stepped out.

There were frequent reports and just as many denials from Buckingham Palace that the marriage was in trouble and that Charles and Diana were thinking of splitting up. Thenin December 1992Prime Minister John Major told a packed House of Commons that they had agreed to separate.

The monarchy was faced with its greatest crisis since the abdication in 1936 of Edward VIIIwho was forced to give up the crown because of his love for an American divorceeWallis Warfield Simpson.

In 1994Charles took part in a BBC documentary in which he admitted his adultery and dismissed suggestionsallegedly from Dianathat he was not fit to be King. She retaliated in 1995 with an equally bold television interview confessing her own extra-marital relationshipsher anger at the royal familyher feeling that she was resented by her husband for attracting more favorable attention than he and her conviction that Charles would not make a good King. There were widespread reports that she wanted to see the crown go directly to her son Williamfamiliarly known as Wills.

The British public has always been more smitten with Diana than with Charlesa figure perceived as remotecool and unpleasantly eccentric. Her television interview was seen as much more convincing than hisincreasing her popularity and putting the British more than ever off the man destined to become their monarch. Just this month a poll said that for the first timea majority of the public did not believe that Britain needed a monarchy anymorea feeling only intensified by Diana's estrangement from Buckingham Palace and her seemingly heart-broken televised lament that ''there were three of us in this marriageso it was a bit crowded.''

Diana gained public sympathy with her admission of ''a feeling of being no good at everything and useless and hopeless and failed in every direction'' and her suggestions that it was Prince Charles and his coterie of male friends who held her up to such ridicule. She unblushingly talked of her humiliating affair with Mr. Hewittsaying she ''adored'' him and was ''very let down'' by his ending the relationship.

With the divorceshe had to give up being addressed as Her Royal Highnessthe honorific that separates the royal family's inner circle from other nobles and aristocrats. But she was able to keep the title Princess of Walesand she obtained a lump sum payment of $22.5 million and $600,000 a year to maintain her offices. She also got to keep her five-bedroomfour-reception-room apartment at Kensington Palace. Maybe most importantshe gained equal access with Prince Charles to her two children.

 2160,  2006, a, There are just so many of themfrom Diesel to Dior. The window shoppers peeped at the ornate Victoria's Secretmore burlesque show than storeand fogged up the display cases at the 13,000-square-foot Tourneau Time Domethe largest watch store in the country. Collectors bought Las Vegas keepsakesranging from a $3.99 magnet depicting the "Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas" signfor sale at Magnets Maximusto a $320 pair of crystal dicesold only in the Las Vegas outlet of Baccaratthe French crystal company. And even I had specialty shops to get excited about - like Giuseppe Zanottithe Italian shoemakerand Scoop NYCthe chic sportswear boutique - neither of which has an outpost in Los Angeles.

Despite the thick mass of people meandering around the Forumthe higher-end shops were deserted. (No worry: One high roller a day will meet the store's quota.) In the mod and colorful Emilio Pucci storea salesperson pounced the moment I paused in front of a large$690 handbag - hopingno doubtthat I was today's big spender. "Fabulous. Bluebell print. You must have itno?"

I demurredand after a few more failed attemptshe found readier prey in a woman who asked to try on some down-filled moon boots for $250. Moments lateras the woman handed over her credit cardI asked her where she was from. "Western Florida," she said. Where it gets cold enough for moon boots? "It's a souvenir."

This was no ordinary shopping mall.

I could not say the same for the Fashion Show Mallthe other major shopping center on the Strip. It is huge: two million square feetto be exact. It has over 250 storesincluding Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstroman Apple storeand some smaller boutiques like Talulah Gwhich stocks the hard-to-find Chloe calfskin Paddington Bag for $1,200 and True Religion jeanswhich start at $182. But without significant shoppertainment - save its 80-foot rising runway that features flashy fashion shows three days a week - you could be anywhereto which I say: if you're going to be anywhereyou might as well get a discount. The Fashion Outlets of Las Vegasa 30-minute drive from the Stripin Primma town on the California borderoffer merchandise similar to that at the Fashion Show's Neiman MarcusBCBG and Cole Haan shopsfor discounts of 50 and 60 percent.

It was time to hit the Wynn. In 1998when Mr. Wynn opened the Via Bellagioit was the first to lure such luxury retailers as ChanelGiorgio ArmaniHermès and Prada to a Las Vegas resort. Since thennew high-end stores have appeared in lesser resortsthe Forum Shops have expanded (though the Gucci at the Bellagioplaced next to its Italian rivalsFendi and Pradaseems more alluring than its Forum counterpart) and Mr. Wynn has sold the Bellagio.

Anticipating Steve Wynn's personal one-upmanship was making me wildly curiousso I hopped a cab for the 1.4-mile ride up Las Vegas Boulevard to the Wynn Las Vegas. Eleven minutes laterI arrived at the entrancewhich I made the mistake of bypassing in order to visit the Penske-Wynn Ferrari-Maserati dealership at the other end of the grand circular drive. A warning: you can only access the showroom from inside the casinoand the line can be as long as the one for a Cirque du Soleil show. And if you're in the market for a new Ferrari (they start at around $200,000)you'll have to wait for thattoo; the dealership's allotment was sold out within two months of opening.

I'm not sure what I was expecting when I finally arrived at the Wynn Esplanade. A majestic choirperhaps? An astounding array of luxury boutiques I had always wanted to shop in? Or relief for my aching feet? There was no choirand although I spotted the first Las Vegas retail branches of Oscar de la RentaJean Paul Gaultier and Manolo Blahnik among the hallway of marquee-name shopsit was the comfort of the plushparasol-patterned carpet beneath my feet that truly impressed. There was also a calm about the placeas if it were miles away from the din of the casino.

Inside Cartierwhen I said I was "just looking," I was given a glass of champagne and shown a specialty dice charm for $3,150made exclusively for the Wynn. You don't even need money: in Chanela woman without a purse paid $1,795 for one just by showing her room key. I was studying a case of yellow diamonds at Graffthe London-based jewelerwhen a middle-aged man in shortssocks and sandals came in. "I was just hoping to take a picture of the marble floor," he said.

The salespeople smiled warmly. "No problem." You never know: anyone could be a jackpot winner.

I found real cash transactions going down at the Wynn Signature storewhere anything with the resort's logo - like a $28 baseball hat$6 shot glassor $2.50 tin of Wynn mints - was flying off the shelves.

Back in the designer store lineupI caught myself peering into the window of Louis Vuittonthe French store that is so ubiquitous that I had already passed two others earlier that dayat the Fashion Show Mall and the Caesars Forum Shops. But because of these serene surroundingsthe perfectly controlled mild temperatureand the relative comfort of the carpeted floorit was the siren song of the Wynn Esplanade's Louis Vuitton that made me an offer I apparently couldn't refuse.

Sowhile I may never have occasion to carry an indigo patent leather clutchI now own one for $580. We'll call it a souvenir.

 4242,  1995, a, CBS will announce a deal with Bill Cosby today for his first new situation comedy since his "Cosby Show" was television's biggest hit in the 1980's.

The dealwhich will reunite Mr. Cosby with the production team of Marcy Carsey and Tom Werneris one of the biggest financial commitments made by a network in recent yearssaid a senior executive at a rival network. The agreement guarantees the new show a two-year run on CBS.

Executives at the network declined yesterday to discuss the terms of the dealbut they confirmed several details published yesterday in The Hollywood Reporterthe entertainment trade publication.

Mr. Cosby's new comedywhich will go on the air next fallwill be based on a British sitcom called "One Foot in the Grave," which concerns a curmudgeonly man's struggles with the irritations of everyday life after ending a professional career. More details of the deal and the series are scheduled to be announced today at a news conference at CBS.
 2514,  2004, a, Tim Carlander of Vandeventer & Carlandera firm in Seattleoffered to help a friend design a cabin on Camano Island60 miles north of the citya few years after a 16-by-22-foot foundation had been poured. ''I asked iffor no feeshe'd let me start playing around'' with ideashe said. The narrow lot was high on a bluffwith views across Saratoga Passage and toward the Olympic Mountains.

Seen from the outsidethe resulting cabintop leftat just 352 square feetsuggests a friendly argument between a box and a half gable. A wood-frame living spacecomplete with a kitchenis topped by a sloping roof that contains a sleeping loft. On the side facing the water and a gardenthe box is clad in dark gray cement board and has 8-by-8-foot doorstop rightthat can be fully opened; on the other sidespanels of galvanized steel offer privacy. Those panels also form the L-shape wall enclosing a gardenabove left.

The client handled much of the interior finish workwhich helped keep costs to just $70,000not including the foundation. For Mr. Carlander (above rightwith Bill Vandeventer) the cabin is a gentle rebuke to the palatial weekend getaways (which he refers to as ''quaint 20,000-square-foot retreats'') typically built in this region by Microsoft millionaires. ''This cabin is basically a single-car garage with a slopey roof,'' he said. ''But it's so much more than that.'' The client seems to agree: she now lives there full-time. CHRISTOPHER HAWTHORNE

 5124,  1989, a, Mel Tormemaking his 13th appearance at what is currently known as the JVC Jazz Festival on Thursday evening at Carnegie Hallshowed why he is welcomed back so frequently.

Mr. Torme has never been one to rest on his laurels. Ever since he became well known as leader of the singing group the Mel-Tones through their recordings with Artie Shaw's orchestra 43 years agohe has been a diligent searcher for what he describes as ''credible'' songs. And in the past decadeat an age when most pop singers are simply trying to hold on to what voice they have lefthe has developed vocal range and control that are a far cry from the husky-toned singing of his early days when he was celebrated as ''the Velvet Fog.''

Nowat 65still looking like a worldly cherub but showing a slimmer profilehis vocal control and coloring are continuing to develop; he showed this in beautifully projected treatments of ''More Than You Know'' and ''Midnight Sun.'' His search for new songwriters and new songs is now focused on Donald Faganwhose song ''The Goodbye Look'' was built into a drivingdazzling blend of words and scat by Mr. Torme and his bassistJay Leonhart.

Mr. Torme contributed still more to the swinging energy of the concert whenas a finalehe sat down at the drums to join the clarinetist Buddy DeFranco and the vibraphonist Terry Gibbswho had opened the evening with a set that mixed Mr. DeFranco's willowy lines and Mr. Gibbs's enthusiastic momentum.

 6107,  1977, a, The campaign for Governor of New Jerseynow in its last five weeksfinally has produced some heatand in the process seems to have awakened the state's volatile electorate to the elements of high drama present in this contest:

Governor Byrnea 721,000‐vote winner four years ago who lost most of his luster early in his administrationhad to beat nine rivals to get the Democratic nomination last June. Now he is trying to overtake his Republican opponentState Senator Raymond H. Batemanwho has a 7‐point leadaccording to the polls.

There is a strong emotional issuethe state income taxchampioned by Mr. Byrne and denounced by Mr. Bateman.

Interest in the outcome extends to the White House since New Jersey and Virginia are the only states in the nation with governorship races this year and the results could be interpreted as the first referendum on the Carter Administration. President Carter recently campaigned in the state with Mr. Byrne and said he would be back before the election Nov. 8.

Not only the tempo but the nature of the campaign has changed. The Governorthe target for so long of harsh criticism over the income taxwent on the attack two weeks ago when Mr. Bateman offered a program that he says would enable him to run the state for the next four years without the tax. Mr. Byrne ridiculed the plan and its authorreminding audiences that Mr. Bateman had voted for an income tax in the pastand generally succeeded in putting his opponent on the defensive. Political observers could only wonderhoweverhow all this was affecting the state's inscrutableso‐far passive electorate.

 3320,  2000, a, In a culture of silencewords can be weapons. In perhaps no contemporary state has the written word proved more threatening than in Saudi Arabiawhere sinssources of shame and sometimes even accomplishments tend to be hidden away.

So it was with a determined lack of fanfare nearly a decade ago that Prince Khaled bin Sultanthe Saudi media baron and former co-commander of the military coalition against Iraq in the Persian Gulf waropened a front in the cultural war against silence in his countryeven as he prepared to lead the multinational forces into battle to free Kuwait.

In September 1990the prince quietly agreed to finance an ambitious project by a group of Saudi scholars to document the country's rich cultural heritage and traditions before they disappeared. Ten years and several million dollars laterthe Encyclopedia of Folklore of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabiaa 12-volumeArabic-language compendium of a vanishing way of lifehas just been printed in Belgium. Its authors say that the serieswhich includes 5,000 drawingsillustrations and graphsis the largest body of secular scholarship ever produced in Saudi Arabia. It includes separate volumes on topics like historical and archaeological sitestraditional medicinegeographyeven children's games. And there is an entire volume devoted to the camel.

While Prince Khaled said he had contemplated such a project for two years before the gulf warthe conflict was the project's main catalyst. ''The widespread ignorance of Saudi Arabia and its cultural heritagenot just among foreigners but among younger Saudis made me determined to try and document and preserve our traditions before it was too late,'' he said in a telephone interview.

An indictment handed up by a Federal grand jury in Newark accuses Mr. Lonergan49of BelmarN.J.of conspiring with a document broker -- someone who helps foreigners wend their way through the complex immigration process -- to make false statements on forms for allowing aliens living in the United States to re-enter the United States after traveling abroad. The documents were used by an unspecified number of aliensincluding two Iraqi citizens living in Jordanto gain entry to this country.

 1149,  2012, a, “I want to give credit to Tim Cook for this,” said Dara O’Rourkeassociate professor of environmental and labor policy at the University of CaliforniaBerkeley . “He’s admitting they’ve got problems.”

Apple’s supply chain is a subject much closer to Mr. Cook than it was to his predecessor. Not long after Mr. Jobs returned to lead Apple in 1997he hired Mr. Cook to clean up the manufacturing operationswhich were in disarraywith bloated inventory that hurt its profits. Over more than a decadeMr. Cook helped transform Apple’s operations into the envy of the electronics industrywith an array of partnersmostly in Asia able to efficiently pump out its latest products.

In contrast to Mr. CookMr. Jobs never visited the factories in China where Apple’s products were madeaccording to two people with knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified to avoid antagonizing Apple.

During the years when he was chief executiveMr. Jobs was never as directly engaged with Apple’s effort to audit its suppliers as Mr. Cook wasaccording to a former Apple executive who declined to be identified. Stillwhen Mr. Jobs learned of the more serious violations of its supplier code of conduct — instances where child labor was usedfor example — he was outragedthis person said.

Mr. Cook has spoken publicly of how his blue-collar roots growing up in Alabama gave him an early appreciation for factory work. “I spent a lot of time in factories personallyand not just as an executive,” Mr. Cook told investors at a conference in San Francisco in February. “I worked in a paper mill in Alabama and an aluminum plant in Virginia .”

Some labor rights advocatesthoughsaid they were not yet convinced that last week’s report about conditions in Foxconn factories would lead to meaningful improvements for workerssaying that earlier promises of progress by Apple and its partners had not been fulfilled.

“It looks like a pattern I’ve observed before,” said Jeff Ballingera global labor activist and researcher. “It’s a report to get you over and hopefully things will die down. It’s not very convincing.”

Since 2007Apple has published annual reports with the results of audits of factories where its products are produced. But in the last several months under Mr. Cook’s watchthe company has taken a bolder set of steps to prod its suppliers into making workplace improvements.

In Januarywhen Apple published its 2012 annual report on conditions within its suppliers’ factoriesthe company also released the names of 156 companies that supplied it with parts and other services involved in the manufacturing of Apple productssomething it had previously declined to do.

To help end excessive overtime workit began publishing monthly reports on compliance with Apple’s policy of a 60-hour workweek at its supplier factories. For the month of FebruaryApple said that compliance figure rose to 89 percent from 84 percent in January.

This yearApple also became the first technology company to join the Fair Labor Associationand it invited the nonprofit global monitoring group to conduct inspections of its suppliers’ factories in China and elsewhere.

Last weekthe group published the results of its first inspections of Apple’s supply chainciting numerous violations of Chinese labor laws and regulations at Foxconn factoriesincluding instances where workers exceeded the 60-hour workweek that is the association’s standard.

Foxconnwhich is based in Taiwan promised that by July 2013 its employees would no longer exceed the 49-hour workweek limit set by Chinese law. Workers will not see a pay decline because of corresponding wage increasesFoxconn pledged.

In a statementApple said“Our team has been working for years to educate workersimprove conditions and make Apple’s supply chain a model for the industrywhich is why we asked the F.L.A. to conduct these audits.”

Apple has said it had made many improvements to factory conditions over the years. In 2008for examplecompany inspectors discovered a situation in which a supplier had forced foreign workers to give up their passports to factory managerseffectively limiting their ability to leave their jobs. Apple demanded that the supplierunnamed in Apple’s annual report mentioning the incidentreturn the passports to the workers.

Other problems have been harder for Apple to eradicate. Even Mr. Cook conceded in his speech at the investor conference in February that Apple had consistently found that suppliers had violated the company’s overtime policies.

Daniel Diermeiera professor at Northwestern University who studies reputation managementsays he believes the more aggressive stance by Apple toward factory conditions is the result of greater scrutiny of the company by media and advocacy groupsat a time when there is also intense interest in Apple’s soaring share price and cash reserves. But he also believes Mr. Cook’s leadership has played a role in the changes.

“I think he probably has a deeper understandingand this is more personal for him than it might be for other executives,” Mr. Diermeier said.

Some worker advocates say they are hopeful the changes that have occurred under Mr. Cook will lead to lasting improvements in the manufacturing of electronics products.

“They have an opportunity to become the new face of sustainable production in the electronics sector,” said Meg Roggensacksenior adviserbusiness and human rights at Human Rights Firsta nongovernmental organization. “They’re smart enough. They’re well capitalized enough.”
 3596,  1998, a, To the Editor:

In his generous review of my book''Painting by Numbers: Komar and Melamid's Scientific Guide to Art'' (Jan. 4)Luc Sante suggests that the poll of American tastes in paintingwhich forms the basis of the whole project that the book engageswas a simple matter of artists' hiring telephone researchers to ring up some people with a few questions. This doesn't do justice to what was a formidable collaborative effort.

Chief among the collaborators was the Nation Institutea nonprofit organization that raised all of the money for the American poll and contracted an established Boston firmMarttila & Kileyto conduct it. The pollsters then drafted the questionnaire in concert with the artists and some of us from the Nation Institute/Nation magazine offices; tested it in focus groups at the Manhattan Opinion Center; and hired the trained professionals who finally telephoned a representative sample of American households. A similar approach was taken by other firms in countries subsequently surveyed.

In other wordsthis poll -- statistically accurate within a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentat a 95 percent confidence level -- was no different in execution from any of the polls regularly used to determine the names of laundry detergent orindeedthe direction of American foreign policy. As Alexander Melamid says in an interview in the book: ''We just were thinking about how this society worksand how the rulers in this society get in touch with the peoplewith real American people. How producers get in touch with consumers. In real life they take polls. . . . And this is a scientifically accurate pollso if this poll is wrongthen all polls are wrong.''

One other small correction: the discussion of the project in which Dore Ashton and others from the art world participatedand which Sante citestook place not at the Whitney Museum but at the School of Visual Arts.

 1908,  2008, a, Updated11 p.m. | It was the aviation equivalent of the arrival of the Queen Mary 2 in New York City. Todaythe double-decker superjumbo Airbus 380the largest plane ever manufacturedlanded at John F. Kennedy International Airportin its first commercial flight to the United States.

The A380an Emirates Air plane from Dubaiin the United Arab Emirateslanded around 4:30 p.m. A last-minute shift in wind caused the airport to change the landing path to a much shorter runway (which made the plane very low to the ground when it landedbarely clearing the trees).

The size and amenities of the A380 are jaw dropping. The first class section has luxury cruise ship features — showers and spas and private suitesfurnished with personal mini-barswardrobesand massage system. The plane can fly up to 7,456 miles on a full loadwhich carries 14 first class76 business and 399 economy seats.

The plane is so large that airports around the worldincluding Kennedyhad to spend an average of $100 million to upgrade the taxiways to accommodate its heft.

(An earlier version of this articleand the accompanying headlinedescribed the A380 as the world’s largest plane. Airbus calls it the world’s largest passenger airliner. But as several readers helpfully noted in their commentsthere are larger planethough they were not designed for commercial passenger service.)

By the time the A380 debuted commercially last yearit was already two years late and 50 percent over its initial $12 billion budget. To date there are 202 orders for the A380 from 17 customers. Emirates Air is the largest customerhaving ordered 58 planes.

Airbus said the updated design means the plane is getting 20 percent greater efficiency on a seat-mile basis than any other airplanewhich is more critical than ever as fuel prices have forced airlines to seek savings in the smallest ways. The Airbus A380 also became the first commercial aircraft to fly with a synthetic liquid fuel processed from gas in a three-hour flight between FiltonEnglandand ToulouseFrance.

Kennedy International Airporthoweveris no longer considered the top place to showcase a new plane. The A380 debuted commercially in October 2007 with a Singapore Airlines flight between Singapore and Sydney.

But 40 years agoJ.F.K. was chosen as the stage for the debut of the Boeing 747a plane which began the jumbo-jet age and held the record for passenger capacity for four decades until it was eclipsed by the Airbus A380.

For its maiden commercial voyagethe 747 hurtled down the runway at Kennedy Airport bound for London on Jan. 211970. It was a Pan American World Airways flightonce an icon of flying chic.

J.F.K.which was built originally on some 1,000 acres of marshy landlong reigned as one the world’s most celebrated airports. But that seems no longer the case. (We already know thatat least when it comes to long-haul flightsthe best airlines are not necessarily the American ones.)

Among the top 10 finishers of the World Airport Awards in 2008 were five airports in Asiafour in Europe and one in Africa (Cape TownSouth Africa). The highest-ranked American airport was San Francisco International Airportat No. 11.

The top 10 award winners this year were:

Hong Kong International Airport Singapore Changi International Airport Incheon International Airport in SeoulSouth Korea Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia Munich Airport in Germany Kansai International Airport in Osaka Bay Copenhagen Airport in Denmark Zurich Airport in Switzerland Helsinki Vantaa Airport in Finland Cape Town International Airport in South Africa

The top-ranked airports are thorough modernwith features like free Wi-Fi and high-speed train service to downtown.

Kennedy Airportonce the Jewel of the Jet Agehas become the bane of many world travelers. Despite the arrival of the AirTrainthere is still no efficient way to get directly from Lower or Midtown Manhattan to the airportin JamaicaQueens. And the airport has been hobbled by a layout in which each airline has its own terminal or ticketing area.

Over the past two decadesother cities like Atlanta and Denver have built airports that are considered more modern than J.F.K.which as early as 1990 was facing challenges. In recent yearsthe airport has undergone renovationsbut the construction has sometimes compounded the misery of travelwith disruptive barricadesrerouted traffic and makeshift quarters.

 141,  2019, a, SeinfeldChappelleHaddishWong : We have plenty of choices when it comes to stand-up comics in the United States. But sit-down comedyas in rakugoa centuries-old form of Japanese comic storytelling — not so much. Katsura Sunshinethe star and director of “ Katsura Sunshine’s Rakugo ,” at New World Stages brings the formwith buoyant humor and play fulnessOff Broadway.

The stage is adorned simplywith red and white lanterns overhead and a rectangular platform on which Mr. Sunshine kneels for the performancein the traditional style. A typical rakugo performance consists of stories delivered with three parts: an introductionthe story proper and the punch line. But when Mr. Sunshine steps onto the stagesomething about the sight doesn’t quite compute.

Starting with the Guy Fieri -style bottle-blond hair.

Mr. Sunshinedressed in a kimono and bearing the two traditional props of the form — a fan (sensu) and a hand towel (tenugui) — was born in Toronto and is of Slovenian descent. One may enter fearing the twin terrors of cultural insensitivity and appropriationjust to find them unfounded.

Because Mr. Sunshinewhose given name is Gregory Robic is no drive-by enthusiast.

 3179,  2001, a, Hours after Mike Richter made 26 saves in the Rangers' 3-0 victory over the Boston Bruins last night at Madison Square GardenDan Blackburnthe 18-year-old who could open the season as Richter's backupagreed to a three-year deal.

The contractwhich is likely to be worth the rookie salary cap of $3.525 millionensures that Blackburn will not have to be sent back to his junior teamthe Kootenay Ice of the Western Hockey League. Had Blackburn not come to terms before 3 p.m. todayhe would have been returned to Kootenay. He was the Rangers' first selection10th over allin this summer's entry draft.

''The Rangers told him he had a job here as long as he played well,'' said Mark HallBlackburn's agentwho reached agreement on the contract with Glen Satherthe Rangers' president and general manager.

If Blackburn appears in at least 10 N.H.L. games in which he plays 31 or more minutes this seasonhe will lose a year's exemption from the waiver draft. And if the Rangers send Blackburn back to Kootenaythey cannot recall him unless there is an emergency or until his junior season is over.

 3301,  2000, a, The apparent conflict over whether Syria does or does not back the Lebanese and Hezbollah position is more than a matter of semantics.

Leaders of Hezbollahthe main guerrilla movement in the southhave said they will not abandon their war until Israel gives up Shabaa Farmsa mountainous stretch of land at the base of Mount Hermon in the Golan Heightsand releases all Lebanese held in Israeli jails.

The Lebanese governmentwhich has permitted the Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim militia to operate freely in the south and has lauded it as a national liberation forcehas echoed the Hezbollah threats.

But at the same timethe government and Hezbollah are tightly tied to Syriawhich has some 30,000 soldiers and an undisclosed number of intelligence agents in Lebanon. So a Syrian decision to accept Israel's withdrawal as full compliance with Resolution 425 would obligate Lebanon and the militia to follow suit.

As far as the United Nations resolutions are concernedShabaa Farms is part of the land Israel seized from Syria along with the Golan Heights. Lebanese officials have said they want all their land restoredregardless of when it was occupied.

United Nations officialsincluding Mr. Roed-Larsenhave said recently that the ownership of Shabaa Farms is a matter to be decided between Syria and Lebanon. The two countries have never agreed on an international border between them.

Shabaa Farms is a rockymountainous tract along Lebanon's southeastern borderstrategic because it overlooks the Golan Heights and also southern Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa region along Lebanon's border with Syria. Seven small rivers that feed into the Jordan all converge in a depression of the Shabaa Farms land.

 2405,  2005, a, For several years nowThomas L. Friedman has balanced two major subjects: the Middle East and globalization. The Middle Eastwith the specter of civilizational clashes and apocalyptic terrorismhas been the bad news. Globalizationpromising international prosperity and harmonyhas been the good. Yet as Friedman shows in his new book"The World Is Flat," this good news may not be all that goodat least for those who keep an eye on America's place in the world. Friedman presents a passel of statistics showing that we are falling badly behind in the crucial areas of science and technology.

There is probably no one more aware of these trends than Fareed Zakariathe editor of Newsweek International and author of the best-selling book "The Future of Freedom." In his review of Friedman's book (Page 10)Zakaria cites a passage in which Friedman stands outside an outsourcing company in Bangalore and watches "wave after wave" of young Indian techies passing byall eagerall prepared to participate in the new global economy. Meanwhileas Friedman tells usAmerica ranked third in the world in the number of science degrees awarded to 18-to-24-year-olds three decades ago. Today it ranks 17th.

 6218,  1975, a, New Jersey's 70,000 daily rail commuters began paying more for their rides today as the State Supreme Court and State Legislature prepared to discuss the controversial fare schedules.

The Supreme Court will meet in Trenton to decide whether opponents of the new fares are entitled to a temporary injunction that had been granted Friday by Superior Court Judge Baruch Seidman and then lifted a few hours later by Supreme Court Justice Sidney M. Schreiber.

The Court will also be asked to conduct a scheduled Dec. 8 hearing on the fare increases.

The hearing was ordered for a three‐judge appellate court panel by Judge Seidman.

Harold Ruvoldt Jr.the Hudson County Counselis leading the court challenge. He said that the fare controversy was certain to reach the state's highest court eventually and that he would ask that it be taken up directly.

 3891,  1997, a, Aside from the obvious -- that ''E.R.'' and ''Seinfeld'' are unmatchable successes -- the first week of the new television season left most network executives groping for indications of what viewers really likeand what they reallyreally don't like.

Some early signs have already been smudged. After Week 1for exampleit looked as if NBC had severely dented CBS's four-comedy block on Monday with its ''League of Their Own'' lineup of female comedies. But the early news from Week 2 was that NBC's Monday comediesmost of which are despised by criticsfell backward in a big way.

That was the second bit of unhappy news for NBCwhich sailed through much of the first week looking as if it was heading for an ever more dominant season. NBC threw a monster Thursday NBC at its competitorswith live ''E.R'' and a new ''Seinfeld'' that actually set records for that now venerable show.

But Sunday night NBC's new comedies''Men Behaving Badly'' and ''Jenny,'' trailed all three other networkseven among the young viewers NBC has declared the Holy Grail of television. Stillit was far from the worst network news of the week.

 5090,  1989, a, In an effort to reduce a growing tide of plastic waste it must either burn or burythe Minneapolis City Council adopted an ordinance today to ban most throwaway plastic food packaging from grocery store shelves and fast-food outlets.

The legislationwhich does not take effect until July 1990would permit the use of items like plastic milk jugs and soft-drink bottles only if the city can work out an acceptable recycling program for plastics.

The Minneapolis ordinance and a nearly identical piece of legislation pending before the St. Paul City Council are the most far-reaching efforts yet by local governments to restrict the growing volume of plastic waste making its way into the nation's municipal landfills and incinerators.

In generalthe ordinance would prohibit any kind of packaging that is not environmentally acceptable; that ispackaging that is not naturally degradablelike paper; returnable for reuselike some glass containers; or acceptable for recyclinglike metal cans. Long Island Ordinance

 5658,  1986, a, To the Editor:

Last weekendmy family and I traveled to Washington to welcome and walk with the Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmamentseveral hundred braveconscious and caring peoplewho have walked from California to Washington since last March (Washington Talk pageNov. 15).

Their message has been one of peace. All have left their former lives to help spread word of the insanity of the arms race. There were doctorslawyersgrandmothers and grandchildrenstudentswhite-collar and blue-collar workers - just real people who have the same gut feeling. They love life and don't want it to end. We were 10,000 strong on Saturdayfirst at Meridian Parkthen at Lafayette Parkjust across from the White Houseand finallyat the Lincoln Memorial. We heard the scientist and scholar Carl Sagan address the insanity of ''Star Wars,'' describing a world without peace as a world in piecesand the Rev. Jesse Jacksonwho spoke of the marchers as ''morally right,'' trying to save the world from total destruction.

There were two other notable people not far off this weekendRonald Reagan and Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Standing just across the street from the White House brought visions of President Reagan congratulating baseball teams and football teams after great victorieswelcoming our astronauts and great artists and musicians as they stood outside on the White House lawn. I could hear his recent and repeated wishes for a world at peace and an end to nuclear weapons. YetRonald Reagan was not there to welcome the peace marchers.

My wife's 8-year-old boya marcher (he was with his father for six months of the march)could not understand why. There was not a word of recognitionand Mr. Reagan should feel ashamed for his silence. I wish he could understand that peace is patriotic. ROBERT CHRUST Key WestFla.Nov. 181986

There’s a stereotype of tennis — fair or not — that it is a gentlemen’s sport. The playerslike the game itselfare supposed to be polite and mild-mannered individuals with affluent backgrounds.

Alex Bogomolov is not like that. And he knows it.

“I grew up differently,” he said. “I’m not the uptight tennis player most people think of.”

Bogomolovwho lost in men’s doubles Thursdaywill take the court again Friday against Rogerio Dutra da Silva of Brazil in the second round of men’s singles. He defeated Steve Johnsonwith whom he has played doubles in the pastin the first round Wednesday.

“I didn’t do too many things well besides mentally give myself a chance to stay in the match,” Bogomolov said. “The good thing isI always fight through the adversity.”

That resiliency is rooted in his upbringing. Russian immigrantshis family did not live the lavish lifestyle his tennis peers enjoyed. Insteadhe had a passionate fatheralso named Alexwho was a prominent tennis player in the Soviet Union and went on to become a successful coach.

When he was 9the Bogomolovs moved to Mexicothen two years later to Miamiwhere Bogomolov Sr. ran a tennis academy.

Bogomolov Jr. and his sister also took to tennis and were coached by their fatherand his sister’s traveling schedule led Bogomolov Sr. to go on the road much of the year. To continue developing as a playeran 11-year-old Bogomolov was sent to Brooklyn to work with a friend of his father. Over the next decadeBogomolov spent half the year in Brooklyn and the other half in Miamihoning his game.

In New YorkBogomolov and his friends attended the Open each summer but never paid for a ticket; they would find a way to sneak in. The group would look for fightsand at 16Bogomolov landed in a holding cell after he was arrested for fighting at the Port Washington Tennis Academy. StillBogomolov takes pride in his upbringing.

“I feel like everybody wanted to prove to the others that we got each other’s backs,” Bogomolav said. “It was just the way it was.”

Bogomolov’s resiliency has been tested more than in just Wednesday’s match.

Firstthere was the pressure of not living up to the expectations as a top junior player.

Then there was a messy divorce from the tennis player Ashley Harkleroadwhom he married when he was 21 and divorced two years later.

“I was in debt for a long time because of it,” he said. “I would have a good resultpay off some of the debtthen not do so well. I never had any momentum.”

Another blow came in 2008. During an event in South KoreaBogomolov fell on his wristbut felt no pain and went on to win the match. He woke up the next day unable to move the wrist. A doctor’s visit revealed he had torn ligaments.

“It was like a knockout punch,” Bogomolov said.

Bogomolov was told he might never be able to use a two-handed backhand again. Then came a break that he said changed his life. A week after returning from Koreahe met Luana Goncalves at a car convention in Miami. The two remained in contact and in the week leading up to his surgery in January 2009 he stayed in New Jersey with Goncalveswho moved to the United States from Brazil as a child.

After surgeryBogomolov took a job as a consultant for a tennis academy in New York with hopes of getting back on the court. But rehabbing did not go as well as expectedand he could not hit a ball without pain.

Then he got some unexpected news.

“I came back from work one day and she told me she was pregnant,” Bogomolov said of Goncalves. “A week after thatI was hitting full-on backhands. It was a miracle because before that I couldn’t even hit a backhand.”

With another mouth to feedBogomolov knew he had to get back on the court to make some money.

“He realized that it was now or never,” Goncalves said.

Three months laterin June 2009he was back on tour. He lost in last year’s United States Open qualifying tournamentbut qualified for every Grand Slam event this yearadvancing to the third round of Wimbledon in June. At 28when most players are on the declineBogomolov is now ranked 44ththe highest in his career.

He credits his sonMaddoxnow 20 months oldand Goncalves for putting him in line.

“I don’t get out of hand like I used to,” he said. “After a lossI would get drunk and depressed. With her it was a big issue we had to change. Right away she changed that. She wouldn’t let me do that. I would pout and she would tell me to change my mentality.”

About June 15President Park called Mr. Min to the Blue Housethe Presidential mansionand talked with him for hours about how to prevent Mr. Kim from testifying. Mr. Kimwho came to America in 1973was perhaps the second most powerful man in Korea when he headed the K.C.I.A.

In the meetingPresident Park instructed Mr. Min to take to the United States a Korean delicacy he knew Mr. Kim liked.

Mr. Min telephoned Mr. Kim from New York on June 18requesting a meeting. Mr. Kim declined to see him.

The next dayhoweverMr. Minaccompanied by a former subordinate of Mr. Kim's at the K.C.I.A.. went to Mr. Kim's home and they talked for eight hours. Mr. Min also visited Mr. Kim's home the next dayJune 20for a long conversation.

In the 16 hours of discussionMr. Kim saidMr. Min offered him the following alternatives:

Mr. Kim was invited to return to Koreawhere he and his family would be guaranteed safety even though he had helped American investigators confidentially and had given an interview to The New York Times.

Mr. Kim and his family could leave the United States for a third countrywhere the Korean Government would pay a large sum for his living expenses.

?Mr. Kim was urged to delay his testimony for two weeks to allow time for discussions with Korean Government officials over what he would say.

Some movies he may just producewithout appearing in front of or behind the camerahe said.

''I wanted to do something that wasn't a vanity deal,'' said Mr. Spaceyreferring to the fact that many studios offer successful actors production arrangements that actually generate few if any movies. ''There's a real opportunity for my company to become a player.''

The company's deal with Fine Line Cinemaa unit of Time Warner's New Lineallows him to retain foreign distribution rights on some of his films and to create over time a library of movies in which he will own a substantial interest.

''I'm interested in walking down roads I haven't walked down before,'' Mr. Spacey said.

At this busy time in his career it is strikingthoughthat he is currently appearing in ''Hurlyburly,'' a movie that represents an unusually well-trodden road. As Mr. Spacey notedwhen he made the leap from regional theater to the New York stage some years agoit was by acting in ''Hurlyburly.''

In facthe saidhe played almost every part in the dark drama before the run was through and his career had begun. In the filmhe plays the smoothreptilian Mickey.

 326,  2017, a, It beganNovaya Gazeta reportedafter a Moscow-based gay rights groupGayRussia.ruapplied for permits to stage gay pride parades in four cities in Russia’s predominantly Muslim North Caucasus regionof which Chechnya is a part.

The group had not focused on the Muslim areas. It had been applying for permits for gay parades in provincial cities around Russiaand collecting the inevitable denialsin order to build a case about gay rights and freedom of assembly with the European Court of Human Rightsin StrasbourgFrance. It had applied to more than 90 municipal governments. Nikolai Alekseeva gay rights activist coordinating this efforttold Novaya Gazeta he had chosen this tactic rather than staging riskyunsanctioned gay parades.

The group had not applied for a permit in Chechnyabut in another Muslim region in southern RussiaKabardino-Balkaria. The mere application there — deniedas usual — had prompted an anti-gay counterdemonstration.

In the restive Muslim regionsMr. Putin has empowered local leaders to press agendas of traditional Muslim valuesto co-opt an Islamist underground. The gay pride parade applications became a galvanizing issue.

“In Chechnyathe command was given for a ‘prophylactic sweep’ and it went as far as real murders,” Novaya Gazeta reported.

According to the reportthe authorities set to finding and arresting closeted gay menpartly by posing as men looking for dates on social networking sites.

“Of coursenone of these people in any way demonstrated their sexual orientation publicly — in the Caucasusthis is equal to a death sentence,” the newspaper wrote of those detained in the sweep.

The immediate problemthey suggestwould be holding off the subsequent waves of attackers. The commanderswho spoke in separate interviews in mid- Septembersaid that if there should be a Soviet attack on Western Europethe second wave of attacking divisions would be supported by surface-to-surface missiles and would have ample air support from bases in East Germany and Poland.

New surveillance systemsthe officers saidwould enable the Western alliance's air forces to strike the missilesair bases and the second attacking wavereferred to as ''follow-on'' forces. The problemas it is seen by ground commandersis the availability of air resources.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's military priority in the event of aggression will be air superiority over the Soviet Air Force. Although the air forces work closely with ground unitscommanders said they would be insistent that before anything elsesuch as bombing enemy missile sitesthey must attain superiority in the air. Reinforcements Are Key Factor

The key factor is the arrival in time and in strength of reinforcing squadrons from the United States and their deployment on NATO airfields. Once therewith air superiority wonthey can start to deal with the follow-up forces and their missile and air support.

 1372,  2011, a, Brendan Hoffman/Bloomberg News

A senior lawyer for the Securities and Exchange Commission recently took center stage in a major case involving a controversial mortgage security sold by Goldman Sachs.

There was just one slight twist in the legal proceedings. The S.E.C. lawyer was not the prosecutor taking the deposition. He was the witness.

This summerAdam Glass — who joined the agency two years ago and is now co-chief counsel in charge of helping write the rules for the complex financial instruments known as derivatives — testified in a deposition about Goldman’s Abacusa mortgage investment that the government argues was designed to fail.

It turns out that Mr. Glass has a unique perspective on Wall Street exotica. Before working on the financial crisis cleanuphe helped create the opaque securities that contributed to the mess.

Jin Lee/Bloomberg News

For many yearsMr. Glass served as the outside counsel to Paulson & Companythe giant New York hedge fund firm run by John Paulsonwho made billions betting against the housing market. And yesMr. Glassin that rolesigned off on Abacuswhich was created specifically for the hedge fund to short subprime mortgages. Mr. Paulson handpicked some of the underlying investments in the derivative.

The governmentin its complaintclaimed that Goldman had “misstated and omitted key facts regarding” Abacusincluding disclosing Mr. Paulson’s role in its creation. The firm paid $550 million to settle the casewithout admitting or denying guilt. Mr. Paulson was never accused of any wrongdoing.

Mr. Glass’s recent deposition was for a separate S.E.C. case against Fabrice Tourrethe young Goldman trader who had developed and marketed Abacus to investors. Mr. Tourre31has denied the accusations.

The revelation of Mr. Glass’s involvement in the Abacus deal could undermine the S.E.C.’s case — or at least prove to be a distracting embarrassment.

Perhaps more importanthis role once again raises questions about the revolving door between Washington and Wall Street at a time when public distrust about the agency and its lack of enforcement action against the culprits of the crisis is running high.

“There are a lot of talented people out there you could hire who weren’t necessarily part of the problem,” said Mary Kreiner Ramireza professor at Washburn University School of Law. “If he was involved in Abacushow is he supposed to police it?”

Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press

It is a common question as the government increasingly looks to fill its ranks with regulatory officials proficient in the language of Wall Street. Robert S. Khuzamithe S.E.C.’s director of enforcementwas previously the general counsel of Deutsche Bank. The agency tapped Eileen Romingerthe former global chief investment officer at Goldman Sachs Asset Managementas its director of investment management.

“The revolving door is such a dominant fact about the S.E.C.’s culture,” said John C. Coffee Jr.a Columbia Law School professor. “You get people who go to Washington for one to three years and then go back to Wall Street.”

The pattern has been well documented. According to the Project on Government Oversight219 former S.E.C. staff members filed 789 “postemployment statements indicating their intent to represent an outside client before the commission” from 2006 to 2010. In other wordsthe one-time government officials are representing Wall Street clients with matters before the agency.

While clearly there are questions about whether the public wants someone in government who just came from industrythe opposite argument can be madetoo: It may be better to have the fox in the henhouse.

The New York Times

President Franklin D. Roosevelt “justified appointing Joe Kennedy as chairman of the S.E.C. with the line: ‘You need to set a thief to catch a thief,’ ” said Professor Coffee. “That is the case for bringing in an industry expert.”

After allthe best way for the government to stay ahead of financial innovations — or at least not fall too far behind — is to employ people who know them best.

After the government’s bailout of A.I.G.some said the insurer should keep paying bonuses to employeesas they were among the few who understood how to unwind some of the company’s complex trades.

Mr. Glasswho has long advocated more regulation of derivatives in certain instancescame to the S.E.C. with a strong finance pedigree. A graduate of Harvard and of Stanford Law SchoolMr. Glass was a partner at Linklaterswhere he founded the firm’s structured finance and derivatives practice.

In addition to Paulson & Companyhe counted Deutsche Bank and Lehman Brothers among his top clients. Mr. Glass was not involved in the controversial opinion that Linklaters issued to Lehman about a practice known as Repo 105 that has come under scrutiny. The tactic allowed Lehman to conceal billions of dollars on its balance sheet.

Mr. Glass took a big pay cut to become a civil servant. The average Linklaters partner made about $2.3 million in 2008the year before he leftaccording to Legal Weekan industry publication. The most Mr. Glass could make at the S.E.C. is $233,000.

When I asked Mr. Glass about his deposition in the Tourre case and his role as the lawyer for Mr. Paulson in the Abacus transactionhe said“Yesthat would be true.” He then directed me to the S.E.C.’s spokesmanwho quickly issued a “no comment.” Spokesmen for Mr. Tourre and Mr. Paulson also declined to comment.

Mr. Glass was involved in reviewing the Abacus deal. He reviewed and commented on an “engagement letter” between Goldman and ACAthe firm that insured the dealsaid three people with knowledge of his testimony and e-mails. He also received a draft copy of the “offering circular” and term sheet provided to outside investorsbut those documents did not include disclosures about how Mr. Paulson’s firm had selected certain mortgage-backed securities for the investment vehicle that he was betting against. The offering circular stated that ACA would select the initial portfolio.

The potential obfuscation of Mr. Paulson’s role is at the center of the case against Mr. Tourre. Mr. Glasswho testified that he did not recall seeing the offering documentdid not ask for additional disclosure about Mr. Paulson’s role or comment on the disclosure languagesaid the people briefed on his deposition. But Mr. Glass had no legal duty to Goldman’s clients.

Mr. Glass worked with Mr. Paulson’s firm to help structure similar mortgage dealsand in one instance he pushed for additional disclosures. On a Deutsche Bank derivatives dealMr. Glass suggested that the bank might want to include more explicit disclosure language for its clientsaccording to a person briefed on the deal. Deutsche Bank did not take Mr. Glass’s advice.

In the endMr. Glass is tangential to the S.E.C.’s case against Mr. Tourre. But he is a central example in the age-old debate about the benefits and costs of Washington’s revolving door.

“I don’t think Mr. Glass has done anything unethical in helping Mr.Paulson structure this product,” Professor Coffee said.

“But it is a case that will raise further questions about the S.E.C.”

 3406,  1999, a, ''America and Europe will continue to need each other into the 21st century,'' Mr. Schmidt said''but it remains to be seen whether the euro is good for the United States. Some governments will shift dollar-denominated assets into euro-denominated oneswhich means the U.S. Treasury might have to pay higher interest rates to attract investors.''

Mr. Giscard d'Estaingthoughwishes the euro were not quite so strong at the start. ''The dollar at the moment is a little too weak,'' he said. ''I have the feeling the American economy is slowing down a bitand that the American authorities accept that. There will be a dynamic between the euro's spontaneous tendency to strengthenand a monetary policy for the euro that will try to contain that tendency.''

The difference in views reflects longstanding divergence in German and French attitudes toward money. For Germanya strong mark was a symbol a defeated nation could take pride in after the wara fact Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said he had felt obliged to take into account when he and Mr. Schmidt devised their 1978 plan.

''For the Germansthe idea of abandoning the Deutsche marklosing itand entrusting it to a bank controlled by governments they did not feel as much confidence in as in their own independent central bankwas impossible,'' Mr. Giscard d'Estaing said. ''So independence for the European central bank was an essential core idea.

''The ease with which the Germans have accepted the end of the mark surprised meand I think it surprised themtoo. The strict criteriathe requirement to cut budget deficitsthe independence of the central bank in the planall had the merit of reassuring the Germans.''

The idea of a strong central bank found its way into the treaty that spelled out the final plan for the euro more than a decade laterthough not quite the way Sir Edward would have preferred. Britainalaswill not use the euroat least at the start.

''Under our original planthe City of London would have been the center of the whole deal,'' he said. Insteadhe added''it all went to Frankfurt,'' where the new European Central Bank is located.

 3666,  1998, a, To the Editor:

Re ''The More the Booksthe Fewer the Editors'' (Arts pagesJune 29):

Although your article on the decline of editing in book publishing touched almost all of the issues involved in the increasing prevalence of sloppiness in book editingyou do not mention the existence in every publishing house of a staff of production editors whose largely thankless job it is to hire freelance copy editorsproofreaders and indexersto review their work and to collate at each stage of the production process the author's corrections.

On paperat leastit reads like quality controland as recently as 10 years agothat is precisely what it was.

In today's bottom-linetime-constrained publishing climatehoweverthe job amounts to no more than damage control -- performing a kind of triage on an entirely ad hoc basisunder incredible pressureall the while chanting the mantra ''Not in my bookplease'' about the really horrifying mistakes we know are out there waiting to happen.

In this contextthe remarkable thing is not only that some of us still carebut that there aren't more mistakes.

''I don't think the technology is likely to develop fast enougheven if he decided to violate the treaty,'' Mr. Levin saidreferring to Mr. Bushin an interview. ''And I think our European allies have responded with caution and concern to such a degree that the president is going to have to look again at the complexities of the issue.''

In the interviewMr. Levin laid out his agenda -- and therefore that of the Senate's new leadership -- on military affairs. He emphasized that he would not occupy himself solely with the high-profile issues of strategic nuclear posture and billion-dollar weapons systemsbut would focus on improving payhealth care and housing for those in uniform. He also said he would try to modernize the Pentagon's purchasing practices and push for another round of base closings to save money.

PARIS — It may be as difficult to believe for fans as it is for the Formula One teams and the mediabut the 2012 season is reallyfinallyover.

It was the longest season everwith 20 races from March to the end of Novemberon every continent except Africa and Antarctica. I heard some fans say the season was too long. For many years the norm had been 16 raceswhich then crept up to 171819. . . until we hit 20 this year. PersonallyI don’t feel the season was too long. Nascar has twice as many races.

The difference is that Nascar’s Sprint Cup races all take place in the United Stateswhile the final third of the F1 season — from the Singapore Grand Prix in late September to the Brazilian Grand Prix last weekend — involved intensive travel from one time zone to anotherfrom one part of the world to anotherwith no respite.

The people who suffered the least through all that workplay and travel were the Formula One drivers. They are the first to admit that.

To close out the seasonthere were three groups of three races one week apartin different parts of the world — Japan and South Korea; India and Abu Dhabi; Texas and Brazil. Journalists and team members were counting the dead in the last few races — sorryI meanthe ill and the wounded.

At least one journalist was sent home after arriving in Texas and it was discovered that he had contracted malaria on the India trip. Two others were thought to have malaria and were sent to rest in the hospital or their hotels. They did not apparently have malaria or the more worrying dengue fever.

The word from teams and other support personnel was that the illness level was much higher this season than normal. I was told in Austin that the venerable Dr. Sid WatkinsFormula One’s great safety innovator who died in Septemberhad once said that for a complete physical recoverythe human body needs a week for each time zone it crossed.

Formula One personnel did not have that this year. My own travel schedule since early October: two weeks on the roadone week at home in Paristwo weeks on the roadone week at hometwo weeks on the road.

Am I complaining? No. But there were times when I knew my body was not finding the adequate time it needed to recover.

The people who suffered the least through all that workplay and travel were the Formula One drivers. They are the first to admit that. Everything is done to protect their healthto give them sleep and a break. Having said thatSebastian Vettelthe driver who won the titlespent a fortune to rent a private jet to take him to the final races in order to diminish the physical exhaustion and stress. Looks like it might have worked — his Abu Dhabi and Brazil races were brilliant.

Having said thaton Thursday around 2 a.m.I noticed a fellow journalist suggesting that the results of the season might change due to a suspicion that Vettel had made an illegal move in Brazil. At first I thought it was a jokethat the journalist was just having some fun now that the season was over and helike mewas getting back into the rhythm of daily life.

But I found that Ferrari had indeed sent a letter asking the International Automobile Federationthe series’ governing bodyto clarify why Vettel had not been penalized for a move that appeared to break the rules. Had Vettel been given the usual 20-second penaltyhe would have dropped to eighth positionand the Ferrari driverFernando Alonsowould have won the driver’s title.

After I read the F.I.A. explanation of what had happened on the trackit was clear that no rule had been broken. And when I saw that the F.I.A. had said all the teams and drivers had been educated in the correct way to deal with the electronic warning lightsit made me suddenly think that perhaps whoever asked for clarification at Ferrari was also just too exhausted from all that travel to have remembered the details.

In the endI learned that the only reason the whole issue came up was because fans had started showing videos on YouTube of the moment that Vettel had passed Jean-Eric Vergne. Ferrari had received thousands of queries from fans on why Vettel had not been penalized. So Ferrari sent an inquirythe F.I.A. quickly gave an explanationand Ferrari accepted it.

It was interesting to see how the fans and YouTube can affect the climate surrounding the series. It was a season without major controversy — except for the Bahrain race — and the biggest controversy had suddenly come three days after the season endedpumped up by media and fan sites.

Among my articles reviewing the seasonthe main feature is an overview of the season; my Q&A with Bobby Epsteinthe chairman of the Circuit of the Americaswhere the U.S. Grand Prix ran in Austin two weeks ago. And this yearI decided to put together a look at the two finalistsVettel and Fernando Alonsonot only because of their contrasting styles but also because they both deserved the title.

Constructor’s Notes

I’ve long been fascinated with self-referential stufffrom the mildly amusing (e.g.the Liar’s Paradox“This statement is false”)to the visually dazzling (Escher’s “Drawing Hands,” “Print Gallery.”)to the deeply troubling (Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem and its mathematical foundation-rattling)to the cosmically profound (Wheeler’s Participatory Anthropic Principle of the Universeand the like). While on the amusing sideI had stumbled upon self-referencing acronyms — so-called “apronyms.” It recently occurred to me“What great fodder for a crossword!” My first submission had five of themincluding a few that Will wasn’t that crazy about (e.g.ENERGETIC LITTLE FELLOW). But he and Joel were sufficiently intrigued that they offered to workshop the idea with me. I shared a bunch more of my favoritesculled over time from various sources and my own addled brain. With Will and Joel adding their deft touches to a couple (A TOME LOCATING A STREET became AID TO LOCATE A STREETfor example)we ultimately landed on the six you see. Squeezing in six of such length made it challenging to keep the fill livelyand meant having to lose payoff entries such as the four-theme-word-crossing SELF-REFERENTIAL (and thus settling for the more subtle reveal in 69- and 120-Across)but I was very pleased with the final result and hope you had fun with it. Once againit was a huge pleasure working with Will and Joel. I was happy to see so many of my clues survive their expert and uncompromising editor’s scalpel. It was also gratifying to sneak in a reference to our youngest grandnieceABIGAILwho I hope will appreciate the “tribute” when she learns to read. Over allI was sufficiently encouraged by the almost simultaneous acceptance of this and a not-yet-published weekday puzzle submissionafter a disappointingly steady run of (however gracious and constructive) rejections following my “beginner’s luck” first submission last yearthat I think I’ll stick with this newfound hobby/budding passion of mine for a while longer and see how it goes. BesidesBeebo (Abby) has quite a few siblings and cousins who may demand equal time.

 2733,  2003, a, Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.

Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lessonstudents consider why photographs in space might not show stars and research the importance of light in this phenomenon. They then research other scientific processes related to light or its absence and create “How It Works” posters about them. Finallystudents further examine the idea of light pollution and write persuasive paragraphs supporting their views.



Author(s):

Priscilla ChanThe New York Times Learning Network

Bridget AndersonThe Bank Street College of Education in New York City

Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will:

1. Generate reasons for why a photograph taken in space might not show stars.

2. Learn the scientific explanation for the missing stars in space photographs by reading and discussing “Seeing Stars.”

3. Research other light-dependent or light-independent processes; create and present “How It Works” posters about these processes.

4. Further explore the concept of light pollution; share their views in persuasive paragraphs.

Resources / Materials:

-photograph taken in space in which no stars are visible (optional)

-student journals

-pens/pencils

-paper

-classroom blackboard

-copies of the article “Seeing Stars” (one per student)

-resources about light-dependent and light-independent scientific processes (computers with Internet accesslibrary resourcesencyclopediasscience textbooksetc.)

-crayons/markers (enough for students to share)

-poster board (one piece per small group)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Prior to classif availablepost on the boardon a transparency or otherwise make visible to students a photograph taken in space in which no stars are visible. Upon entering classstudents respond to the following prompt in their journals (written on the board prior to class): “In some photographs taken by astronauts in spacestars are not visible. Some people believe that this is proof that these photographs have been faked. Howeverscientists believe there is an explanation for the missing stars. What do you believeand why?” After a few minutesallow students to share their responses. Then discuss the following as a class: Under what conditions are stars visible? Why is it more difficult to see stars in the city than in the countryside? How might this relate to the space photograph situation?

2. As a classread and discuss the article “Seeing Stars,” focusing on the following questions:

a. What explanation is given for why stars are often not seen in photographs taken by astronauts in space or when on airplanes flying at night?

b. How might you make stars visible during your next airplane night flight?

c. Why were the cameras used by the astronauts in 1969 unlikely to capture any stars?

3. Create two columns on the boardone titled “Light-Dependent” and the other titled “Light-Independent.” As a classbrainstorm in these columns a list of scientific processes that require light and another list of scientific processes that do not require light. Student responses may includebut are not limited tophotosynthesisvitamin Dtanningcolor visionand solar light (in the light-dependent column)and sonarradartroglobites (cave dwellers)x-raysand night-vision (in the light-independent column).

Divide students into small groups of two or three students eachand allow each group to choose a light-dependent or light-independent process listed on the board. Using all available resourceseach group should research their process and create a “How It Works” poster which adheres to the following guidelines (written on the board for easier student access):

–Include a picture of the process examined by your grouplabeled as necessary.

–Provide an explanation of why the process is light-dependent or light-independent.

–Identify the types of organisms or technologies that utilize the process.

–Describe consequences if more or less light is added to the process.

Students should complete their posters at home or in a future class. After each group is finishedstudents should present their posters with their classmates and post them in the classroom.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Students respond to the following assignmentwritten on the board for them to copy prior to leaving class: “Examine what is meant by the term ‘light pollution.’ Generate a list of benefits and drawbacks to electric lightsand interview at least three people about how important they think electric lights are and how important they feel it is to avoid light pollution. Thenwrite a persuasive paragraph summarizing your beliefs about light pollution.”

Further Questions for Discussion:

–What is a “conspiracy theorist”? Why might such a person want to consider the moon landing a hoax?

–What is a star?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on initial journal responsesthoughtful participation in class discussionscooperation in small groupsaccuracy in research about light-dependent and light-independent processesand thoughtful and thorough “how it works” posters on those processes.

Vocabulary:

faintcelestialinteriorlunarcitedconspiracytheoristspersistsroutinewavelengths

Extension Activities:

1. Create a “How It Works” poster about the human eyeexplaining how light and dark are regulated by rods and cones.

2. Imagine that you are a third party arbitrator who is trying to resolve a dispute between a power plant that requires 24-hour lighting and a local community that is fighting light pollution. Draw up a proposal for a compromise between the two parties. Consider some of the suggestions provided by a light pollution awareness group (//members.aol.com/ctstarwchr/) and a New Jersey advocacy program (//www.monmouth.com/~ksears/litepol1.htm).

3. View a picture taken by the Hubble Space Telescope of the farthest reaches of space (//hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/2003/01/text). Write a letter to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration stating your feelings about such powerful cameras. Do you value the images of other celestial bodies revealed through this amazing photographyor do you feel that investing in such powerful photography capabilities is an inefficient use of government funds?

4. In the foreseeable futurelight pollution may make it very difficult to see stars at any time. Create a “star capsule” that compiles images and descriptions of stars that will inform young children in the future about what they are missing.

5. Perform a light pollution experiment. Take a night walk to a very illuminated location and count the number of stars you can seeand then repeat your count at a very dark location nearby. Create a graph of your dataand write a conclusion about to what you think the term “light pollution” refers.

6. Explore the “Moon Hoax” controversy by researching different claims made to support or refute the belief that astronauts landed on the moon. Compare the scientific experimentation and explanations offered by Ian Goddard (//iangoddard.net/moon01.htm) with those offered by Kevin Overstreet (//batesmotel.8m.com/). Write a persuasive essay supporting or refuting the hoax theoryusing scientific explanations in your writing.

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Mathematics – Analyze a picture of visible light on Earth from space (//earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/BlueMarble/Images/land_ocean_ice_lights_2048.jpg). Estimate what percent of the landmasses are most inundated by light pollution. Explain your estimation technique in words. Thenplace a piece of graph paper over the picture and confirm your estimationusing a ratio of the number of boxes where light is visible over the total number of boxes covering the landmasses. Analyze the areas that show the highest concentration of light use. What do these patterns reveal about the world?

Global Studies – Locate a city on another landmass that has the opposite light situation as your own city. Write a letter to a young person in that city describing what your city’s sky looks like. Ask him or her to explain what the sky in his or her foreign city looks like.

Technology – Create an illustrated timeline that charts the technological advances in cameras. How do digital cameras of today compare with or differ from the self-standing vintage cameras of the late 1800’s?

 3875,  1997, a, The Yankees have dominated the number-retirement business over the years. They lead the major leagues in the categoryMattingly's number being the 14th they have taken out of service. No other team has retired more than eight numbers.

Perhaps the most curious part of this kind of day is the gifts the player receives. Despite the millions that players make these daysMattingly and his family received a cara pickup trucktwo golf cartsfive sets of golf clubsa computertwo airplane tickets to Europea 51-inch television setthree video cameras and rings or pendants for all.

The player and the commercial donors of the lavish gifts benefitbut wouldn't it be nicer if charities could be the recipients of such largesse?

A collection of former teammates and older Yankees were on hand to help Mattingly celebrate this once-in-a-lifetime day. Invited from a guest list designed by Mattingly himselfBill (Moose) Skowron and Hank Bauer were there because Mattingly ''fell in love with those guys'' at a fantasy camp he once worked; Willie RandolphRich (Goose) GossageJim (Catfish) Hunter and Graig Nettles because he ''learned how to play from them''; Dave Righetti because Mattingly had ''tremendous respect'' for him and because Righetti ''made me feel comfortable''; Mike Pagliarulo because he ''played so hard'' and ''I loved being across the infield from him,'' and Wayne Tolleson because he played with the same intensity as Pagliarulo.

One person Mattingly invited who was not there was Yogi Berrathe manager who made Mattingly an everyday first baseman. Berrathe guest of honor saidhad to be in Californiabut Mattingly knows that Berrawhose own number was retired in 1972has said he will boycott Yankee Stadium as long as George Steinbrenner lives there.

''I was trying to make it real easy for him to come back,'' Mattingly said. ''I didn't want to see him stay away from the Stadium. He deserves to be here.''

Mattinglyafter a two-year hiatusdisclosed that he will not remain apart from the Yankees much longer. He said he hopes to be an instructor in spring training next yearthen work out a way that will enable him to work with the system's young first basemen and hitters.
 4243,  1995, a, A two-year study of fast-food-restaurant employees in Harlem and OaklandCalif.has found that young people from the inner city benefit substantially from the workdespite the low wagesbut there usually is no "next tier" of employment to which they can climb by using the skills they have learned or honed in the restaurants.

This absence of employment at the next step upaccording to two professors of anthropology who conducted the studymakes it extremely difficult for the inner-city youngsterswho are not well educatedto work their way out of poverty.

The kids have mixed feelings," said Prof. Katherine Newman of Columbia Universitywho studied the Harlem workers. "They feel that if they work hard at this it will lead somewhere. But their experience is that it doesn't."

The point of the study was to look closely at the lives of the working poor at a time when much of the attention of government and the media is focused on poor people who are not working. Professor Newman and her colleagueProf. Carol Stack of the University of California at Berkeleywho did the Oakland studysaid the fast-food workers were representative of the majority of the urban poor -- men and women who are working at jobs that even on a full-time basis do not pay enough to adequately support a family.

 72,  2019, a, Update: June 12019

This article has been updated to reflect estimates of satellites potentially appearing in images taken by a telescope that were revised after it was published.

Last monthSpaceX successfully launched 60 500-pound satellites into space. Soon amateur skywatchers started sharing images of those satellites in night skiesigniting an uproar among astronomers who fear that the planned orbiting cluster will wreak havoc on scientific research and trash our view of the cosmos.

The main issue is that those 60 satellites are merely a drop in the bucket. SpaceX anticipates launching thousands of satellites — creating a mega-constellation of false stars collectively called Starlink that will connect the entire planet to the internetand introduce a new line of business for the private spaceflight company.

While astronomers agree that global internet service is a worthy goalthe satellites are bright — too bright.

“This has the potential to change what a natural sky looks like,” said Tyler Nordgrenan astronomer who is now working full-time to promote night skies.

''It was no longer a cellbut a free man's home,'' Mr. Carter explained.

In an interviewone of the Canadianswho asked that his name be withheldsaid he and his wife had become the guardians of a black teen-age boy from the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn in the late 1970's. He said the youthwhile living with them in Ontario and while researching the history of black Americansread Mr. Carter's autobiography''The 16th Round,'' published by Viking Press in 1974. The book gave an account of Mr. Carter's arrest and first conviction in 1967.

The Canadian couplethe youthand other Canadian friends became so intrigued by Mr. Carter's plight that they visited him frequently in Trenton State Prison and are helping him financially. A Ballad and Applause

''We were extremely moved and impressed that Rubin was able to maintain his dignitystrength and sensitivity,'' said the Canadianwho would identify himself only as a businessman.

Lawyers for Mr. Carter and Mr. Artis said the Canadians had obtained transcripts of the trial records and court documents and had provided valuable research help.

While in prisonMr. Carter spoke out often about his case. But he went into seclusion in November 1985 after a Federal District JudgeH. Lee Sarokinoverturned the second convictions of Mr. Carter and Mr. Artis and released Mr. Carter without bail. Mr. Artis had been released in 1981.

Judge Sarokin ruled that a 1976 jury verdict had been ''infected'' by racial bias and that the prosecution withheld evidence that could have aided the defense.
 5943,  1982, a, Will the real Democrat please stand up? That is the question dominating the Democratic primary in Florida's Fourth Congressional District. That contest will be decided in a runoff Tuesday by the voters of this seaside-and-citrus region in the northeastern corner of Florida.

The incumbent is Bill Chappell Jr.a seven-term member of the House who votes consistently with the Southern conservatives who have provided President Reagan with his margin of victory in a number of Congressional votes and are thus known as ''boll weevils.''

The challenger is Reid Hughesa wealthy businessman and environmentalist who criticizes the Reagan economic programcuts in social programs and rapid increases in military spending.

Test of Reagan Appeal

Mr. Chappell led by a narrow margin in the first primary last month but failed to win a majority and was forced into a runoff.

Yesterdaythe two nations seemed to be trying to smooth over their differences. The United States trade representativeClayton K. Yeuttersaid the stock market on Monday overreacted to a decision by the United States to proceed with tariffs on some Japanese electronics and computer products. Big Board Composite Up 1.33

Such talk helped alleviate some of Wall Street's concernssending the New York Stock Exchange composite index up 1.33 points yesterdayto 165.89and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up 2.50to 291.70.

The average share gained 34 cents on the Big Boardwhere advancing issues outnumbered losers by an impressive 993 to 591.

Volume slippedhoweverto 171.8 million shares yesterday from 208.4 million on Mondayan indicationmarket analysts saythat investors were not fully comfortable with getting back into the action.

That discomfortas it turned outmay have been fortunate. At the close of business yesterdayand right before the Citibank actionstock index options contracts were trading at lower than normal.

 2379,  2005, a, Some restaurants stand at unusual culinary crossroads. Metropol stands at an unusual cartographical one.

It faces the intersection of two numbered streets that sound to the uninitiated as if they should be parallel to each other and about a quarter mile apart. But West Fourth and West 10th do indeed meetan asterisklike exception to Manhattan's usually tidy gridan anomaly that happens to be Metropol's address.

The restaurant itself represents a more typical convergence.

It's part bistropart brasseriethose terms and genres being so thoroughly confused and conflated in New York these days. Globe-shaped lighting fixtures dangle from a pressed tin ceiling. A distressed mirror dominates one broad wall.

To those vintage flourishes Metropol weds the semiotics of a certain kind and era of downtown Manhattan cool. There are enormous black-and-white photographs of Edie SedgwickAndy WarholNico. There's a thick cover of darkness.

 1562,  2010, a, Richard S. Fuld Jr. told a federal commission that his firmLehman Brothersfailed only because the Federal Reserve refused to step in as it did with other firms.

Mr. Fuld said that if temporary financing had been available or if Lehman had been allowed to convert to a bank holding company among other stepsbankruptcy could have been averted.

In testimony before the Financial Crisis Inquiry CommissionMr. Fuld said:

Lehman was forced into bankruptcy not because it neglected to act responsibly or seek

solutions to the crisisbut because of a decisionbased on flawed informationnot

to provide Lehman with the support given to each of its competitors and other nonfinancial

firms in the ensuing days.

Mr. Fuld argued that “there was no capital hole” at Lehmansaying that it had $28.4 billion in equity capital as of Aug. 312008. He also contended that Lehman had adequate collateraland that all it needed was a liquidity bridge to get it through those dark days of September 2008. He told the panel:

Lehman had the capital. We needed the liquidity. We had — we went into that last week with over $40 billion of liquidity. We lost close to 30 of it in three days. It was a classic run on the bank. We needed the liquidity.

In his testimonyThomas C. Baxter Jr.the general counsel of the Federal Reserve of New Yorkdisagreed with Mr. Fuld’s premise:

The Federal Reserve did not “allow” Lehman Brothers to diebankruptcy being the equivalent of death to a financial company. Insteadthe Federal Reservethe United States Treasury Departmentthe Securities and Exchange Commission and others tried hard to save it — not for its own sakeof coursebut for the sake of all the families and businesses who would be harmed by the devastating effects of a Lehman bankruptcy. We did not succeedbut the effort made was serious and determined. We came very close.

It’s just a typical few days at Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festivalwhich welcomes dance from around the world to its idyllic campus in the woods. As the festival’s new directorPamela Tatgesaid in a recent curtain speechat a time when walls are going up between nations (or threatening to)the Pillow’s borders are wide open.

The Seoul-based Bereishit Dance Companywhich performed on Thursday in the Doris Duke Theater hereoffers its own study in border-crossing. The troupe’s name is a Hebrew wordthe first one in Genesis (“in the beginning”)though the company pronounces it BRESH-it (rather than the Hebrew ber-ay-SHEET).

And there appear to be some Israeli influences in the work of the directorSoon-ho Parkwho studied in Seoul and the Netherlandsamong other places.

The spotwhich uses the old adage about sleet and rainintercuts images of loyal postal workers battleing bad weather with pictures of the main Post Office branch in New York City.

 893,  2014, a, Republicans were growing increasingly confident on Saturday that they would win the Iowa Senate racepicking up a Democratic-held seat that could ensure that they gain the majority.

Democrats were less certain Iowa was slipping from their grasppointing to their success in persuading voters who do not typically cast ballots in midterm years to vote early.

In conversations Saturday with officials in both partiesthoughthe disagreement over the outlook in Iowa was the exceptionas consensus emerged about the rest of the Senate landscape.

Democratic-held seats in South DakotaMontana and West Virginia are now expected by strategists in both parties to go to the Republicans.

Each side also believes that Senator Jeanne Shaheena Democratwill hang on in New Hampshire. Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina has a slight edgebut the race has now become one of the closest in the country.

Republicans are most optimistic — and Democrats most concerned — about their chances in Colorado and Arkansaswhere Democrats Mark Udall and Mark Pryorrespectivelyare seeking re-election.

Both sides generally agreed that Senator Mark BegichDemocrat of Alaskais in some dangerbut polling is unpredictable enough in the sprawling state that neither party was supremely confident about the outcome.

Of the Republican-held seatsboth parties think the member in most danger is Senator Pat Roberts of Kansaswho is locked in a difficult race with Greg Ormanan Independent.

If that happensand Mr. Orman caucuses with Democratsit would mean that Republicans would need to pick up seven seats to win the 51 they would need to take control of the Senate. (If it is 50-50the Democrats would retain the edgethanks to the tiebreaking vote of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.)

The Kansas race could raises the stakes in the two Southern states that both require candidates to receive more than 50 percent of the vote to win outright on Election Day.

Both sides are preparing for runoffs in Georgia and Louisianawhich could turn on a variety of factors including whether the races are for control of the Senate.

Democrats worry about the prospect of a separate gubernatorial runoff in Georgia in Decembera month before the Senate runoffand the challenge of turning out voters three times in three months. That is why they poured so much money into the state in the last week: A win outright on Election Day by Michelle Nunnthe Democratic nomineecould represent their 50th vote.
 5483,  1987, a, The Postal Service finished the fiscal year 1987 with a loss of more than $200 millionemphasizing the need for the higher rates expected to take effect next springPostmaster General Preston R. Tisch said today.

While the final accounting has not been completedpreliminary results indicate that the Postal Service losses will range from $200 million to $225 millionMr. Tisch said at a National Press Club breakfast. The agency completed its fiscal year last Saturday.

The Postmaster General added thatwhile he would continue to urge postal managers to hold spending downhe expected the agency's losses to reach $400 million in the current fiscal year.

Anticipating those lossesthe Postal Service earlier this year filed for higher rateswhich would raise the cost of a first-class stamp from 22 cents to 25 cents. Increase Likely in April

 5664,  1985, a, Eastern Airlines chairmanFrank Bormantold employees today that he was extending the airline's yearlong wage giveback plan because Eastern could not afford the $22 million a month it would cost to reinstate salaries.

The plan was to expire at midnightbut Mr. Borman said in a company- wide letter that the 18 percent to 22 percent pay cuts negotiated with Eastern's 37,000 employees in December 1983 would be continued until a new agreement was reached.

Eastern made a profit in the third quarterbut lost $41 million in the first 11 months of 1984. It has not made an annual profit since 1979.

''Until the negotiation process is exhausted and a new wage and productivity plan is in placewages and salaries established for all employees will remain at the level set by the 1984 Wage Investment Program,'' Mr. Borman said.

 2807,  2003, a, The set presents the concertos chronologicallybeginning with No. 2 in B flat (composed first but published second). In the opening exposition Mr. Harnoncourt's penchant for breaking up phrases into clear segments is in full operation. After the orchestra plays the hardy opening statement of the themethere is an extra breath before the strings answer with the softlyrical second phrases. The problem is that that slight pause sounds calculatedas if making a point was as important as shaping the phrase.

Mr. Harnoncourt is not afraid to encourage a sense of rough and tumble in the playing when called for. At a turning point in the musicbefore the piano entersthe full orchestra emits three playfully grim fortissimo blasts of unison C naturalsfollowedafter a pauseby three echoes in the strings and flutes a half-step higher. But Mr. Harnoncourt overdoes the contrast. As playedthe passage reminded me of a point that Virgil Thomson once made in reviewing a hyped-up performance of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Whyhe wondereddo musicians assume contrast always involves conflict?

When the piano enters Mr. Aimard brings a similar quality of periodicity to his phrasingbut in a more natural way. You are swept along by the energy in his playingeven in soft momentsand by the punchy clarity in his passageworkqualities that surely stem from his long experience with modern music.

Stilldespite my misgivings about Mr. Harnoncourtwith each listening to these performances (and I've found it hard to stop listening) his conducting has seemed more satisfying. Maybe you just get used to his liberties. Eventually the quality of musical surprise he strives forthe sense that you don't know what will happen nextcomes through.

During the first movement of the B-flat concertowhen the music takes a curiously reflective turnMr. Aimard slows down radically while Mr. Harnoncourt holds the orchestra taut and quietly tense. Suddenly you glimpse in this work steeped in Viennese Classicism the mysticism to come in the Concerto No. 4 in Gwhich transcends any era.

The performance of the G major Concerto has a searching intensity. In the slow movement Mr. Harnoncourt treats the sternunison statements in the strings like grim pronouncement from a Baroque oratorioand Mr. Aimard plays the pleadinghushed chordal responses as if the piano were some wayward soul timorously asking''Will someone listen to me?'' The final movementperformed with wondrous rhythmic bite by Mr. Aimard and driving energy by allachieves a dynamic ambiguity: is the music jaunty or hellbent?
 5525,  1986, a, It's gotten so that Bill Wennington can't find a game anywhere. Wenningtonthe 7-foot center who helped take St. John's to the Final Four last seasonreturned to Alumni Hall the other day for his first visit since being drafted by the Dallas Mavericks last spring.

But if a good workout was in his plansit was not in Lou Carnesecca's.

''We had four days offso I decided to come back and visit my familysee some friends and work out,'' said Wenningtonwho also played high school ball in the areaat Long Island Lutheran. ''It's always been cozy here.''

Having put in very little playing time with DallasWennington hoped to get a good workout with his former teammates. But during his one game against Ron StewartBrian Mahoneythe Redmen's assistant coachshooed him to the other end of the court so that the St. John's players could begin their drills. Later he ran through some drills with the teamand even went head to head against Marco Baldi and Terry Bross. ''But every time I went to shoot or driveCoach would yell'Don't hurt himdon't hurt him,' '' Wennington said with a chuckle. When Carnesecca's fears of injury to his former center led him to keep Wennington out of the full-court scrimmageWennington ambled offcourtand one of the team managers called after him: ''Coming back tomorrow? We practice at 10.''

''So does Long Island Lutheran,'' Wennington answered. ''Why're you going out there?'' the manager asked.
 1548,  2010, a, Former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska could have chosen courageboldnessguts or even lion-heartedness as a yardstick to compare the immigration stances of President Obama and Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona. But the former vice presidential candidate instead went with a much more pointed term on Sunday.

“Jan Brewer has the cojones that our president does not have to look out for all Americansnot just Arizonansbut all Americans in this desire of ours to secure our borders and allow legal immigration to help build this country,” Ms. Palin said on Fox News Sunday.

Ms. Palin attributed Governor Brewer’s nerve to the popular backing she has received and her continued strong support of a controversial Arizona law that was challenged in a lawsuit brought by the Obama administration. The law would have given local police officers broader authority to question people they stop about their immigration statusbut that provision of it and others were derailed by a federal judge’s ruling the day before the law went into effect on July 29. Judge Susan R. Bolton of Federal District Court said a trial needed to be held on whether the provisions would interfere with federal authority on immigration and generate unwarranted scrutiny of legal residents.

The issue of immigration has emerged as increasingly important ahead of midterm elections in Novemberand Ms. Palina potential presidential contender in 2012is not shying from the issue.

“I want to make sure that we haveespecially in these historic mid-term electionswe have people elected — and I want to help them get there — to turn this country around and put it back on the right track,” she said.

Ms. Palin also took issue with President Obama’s proposal to end tax cuts for the wealthy that were enacted by President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003.

“His commitment to let previous tax cuts expire are going to lead to even fewer job opportunities for Americans because it’s the job creators who will be taxed,” she said. “The fewer dollars that they have to reinvest in their own businesses and hire more peoplethe worse it is for all Americans.”

But as vilified as she may be at timesMs. Pelosi is planning an aggressive itinerary to raise money for individual Democratic candidates and for her party as whole in the closing weeks of the campaign.

This weekendMs. Pelosi will speak at fundraisers for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in New York and Los Angelesaccording to her office. She will then attend committee fund-raising dinners with President Obama on Oct. 11 in Coral GablesFla.and on Oct. 23 in Minneapolisand another with the first ladyMichelle Obamain San Francisco on Oct. 25.

In additionshe will visit a local manufacturer in San Francisco on Wednesday to talk about the Democrats’ “Make it in America” agendaand she will address the United Steel Workers’ “Women of Steel” conference in Pittsburgh on Oct. 18. All in allthe news bulletin saidMs. Pelosi will visit eight states for 25 fund-raising events with 21 Democratic lawmakers between now and the Nov. 2 election.

Ms. Pelosi’s office said it was not releasing details about her other destinationsin keeping with longstanding security procedures and noting that other events could be added to her schedule. But given that five of the eight states are New YorkCaliforniaFloridaPennsylvania and Minnesotait seemed likely that Ms. Pelosi would be making repeat visits to Democratic strongholds and steer clear of regions where she could cause political problems for Democratic candidates.

 4855,  1991, a, Former Vice President Walter F. Mondalewho was the Democratic Presidential nominee in 1984said of his party's field for 1992: "Most of them will believe that running for President is simply an extension of running for Governor or Senator. Actuallyit's entirely different. It's the vastness of the countrythe differencesthe demands of people and the sheer exhaustion of it all." A Narrow World View?

Democrats are particularly sensitive to the dangers of insular campaigns after their experience in 1988: The campaign of Gov. Dukakis stayed Boston-and-Cambridge-bound until the endand its strategic decisionsin the view of many Democratsreflected its narrow world view. Some political professionals wonder if Mr. Cuomo carries the seeds of a similar clannishness.

"Around any candidatethe question is how does he arrive at his decisionswho helps make the decisionswhat's the team that decides," said Ann F. Lewisa longtime Democratic strategist. "The early impression of Mario Cuomo is this has been a very small team of people who have known him a long time.

"The experience of other Presidential campaigns suggests that kind of team can take you through a couple of early primariesbut you can't run a national campaign that way," Ms. Lewis added. "The question of field operatives will bedo they have the capacity to grow? Can you trustdelegateempower people to act on behalf of your campaign nationally?"

Jody Powellthe former press secretary to Jimmy Carterwho faced a similar task in melding outsiders into a home state campaignwas tactful. "If you're the Governor of Georgiayou're probably inclined to know that you don't know everything," said Mr. Powellnow a public relations executive in Washington. "I'm not saying this particularly about Mariobut being governor of a big state like New York or Californiamaybe you don't get quite enough of a sense that you need to learn some things about the rest of the country." StillMr. Powell noted that Mr. Cuomo had traveled the country over the years. 'Suspicious' New Yorkers

Another Democratic strategista veteran of Presidential politics who spoke on condition that he not be identifiedsaid"TraditionallyNew York State Democrats are provincial in their view of talent: They're the fast lanethey're the Big Apple. It's a very tough style and a very suspicious style and it assumes that everyone has some other agenda."

But John Marinothe New York Democratic chairman who is a Cuomo allyasserted that Mr. Cuomo has faced these kinds of charges beforeand had shown in his 1982 campaign for governor how he can expand his base. "The fact of the matter is people all across the state joined together to elect himand if this ever happened on a national levelwe'd get a lot of help from people in different places," Mr. Marino said. "And we'd want it and welcome it."

 4896,  1990, a, It has been a year of hurricanes and housing scandalsbut also of quieter tales of American people and places. Here are the lastor at least the latestchapters from the journals of 1989:

William Van Ordena sculptor in VeniceCalif.who is dying of cancerfinished yet another restoration of a statue of the actress Myrna Loy and has taken to his bed. An alarm system has been added to the metal cage that encloses the statueand for the moment it is holding off the vandals who have destroyed the statue each time Mr. Van Orden has restored it12 times in the last decade by his count. But completion of the statue does not seem to have cured his unrequited ''romance'' with Myrna Loyas he had hoped. ''I have still never heard from her,'' he said of the actresswho is now in her 80's and lives in New York City. ''That's a sad thing. It would have been nice to receive a little postcard or something.''

As if putting lights in Wrigley Field was not enough to disturb baseball traditionthe Chicago Cubs spent the regular season in first place. In the endhoweverChicago let another team win the National League pennanta courtesy the Cubs have extended every year since 1945.

“Seeit looks like the safest street in the citybut it’s actually the most dangerous if you happen to be smoking a joint.”

This is how Randy Credico sums up Gay Streeta quietone-block lane in Greenwich Village connecting Waverly Place and Christopher Street. People out for an evening in the Village often use the darkened block as a spot to surreptitiously smoke marijuanahe saysbut the illusion of privacy is shattered by sirens and the swooping down of police officers.

Mr. Credico53a stand-up comic and drug-law reform advocatesays he has been warning people constantlyand that the police in the area have in turn warned him that he is interfering in their arrests.

“The cops are always making arrests hereand so I tell people not to light upthat they’re going to get busted,” he said. “Since when is it a crime to tell people‘Listendon’t break the law.’”

On June 12Mr. Credico had his own run-in with law enforcementafter berating police officers making a pot arrest on Gay Street. According to the policeMr. Credico used obscenities and yelled that that they should be “solving murders,” not making marijuana arrests. He was handcuffed and charged with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct and spent a night in the Manhattan Detention Complexknown as the Tombs. Mr. Credico called the arrest retaliation for his practice of warning pot smokers. (The arrest was widely reportedonline and in New York newspapers.)

Paul J. Brownethe New York Police Department’s deputy commissioner for public informationsaid in an e-mail message that Mr. Credico is “free to lobby for the legalization if he’s so inclinedbut he may not interfere with police.”

At any ratethe arrest seems like the perfect culmination of Mr. Credico’s long crusade against Rockefeller drug laws in New York Statewhich are among the harshest in the nationand he has been a longtime advocate for inmates serving sentences under them. He lives at 13 Gay Streetwhich was once the home of the late radical lawyer William Kunstler and is now the headquarters for the William Moses Kunstler Fund for Racial Justicea legal aid service which Mr. Credico helps runalong with Mr. Kunstler’s widowMargaret.

Mr. Credico said he generally supports the policebut he sees arrests for small amounts of marijuana as a waste of their resources. He said he has begun documenting what he sees as a misguided policy of drug enforcementby taking photographs of plainclothes detectives arresting people for smoking or possessing marijuana. And he lurks outside city courthouses at lunchtime to try to take pictures of judgesprosecutors and detectives bringing in marijuana arrests. He plans to use the pictures to illustrate a comprehensive study to be posted online to prove his claim that the justice system is unfairespecially to people of color.

Much of Mr. Credico’s stand-up routine consists of his drug-law gripes. He says Mr. Kunstler taught him that publicity is perhaps his strongest weapon. Mr. Credico made headlines in October when he offered $25,000 of his own money to bail out Shawn Kovellwho was arrested on cocaine charges along with her boyfriendRobert Chambers“the preppy killer” who pleaded guilty to strangling Jennifer Levin during rough sex in Central Park two decades ago.

On MondayMr. Credico stood outside the courthouse at 100 Centre Streetdressed in jeans and a blazer and tiehe smoked a cigar and wielded a point-and-shoot camera. He paced in front of the courthousescouring the people walking out. The judges he could recognize from sitting in their courtrooms while they heard caseshe said. The prosecutors he could recognize because of their suits (and other attributes which he considers less unflattering). He also looked for detectives walking in people in handcuffs.

“Pretty easy to spot,” he said. “The cops are usually white and the perps are almost always people of color. They get them on measlyharmless marijuana arrestswhich is the fuel they use to keep this factory of a criminal justice system going.”

He had an acquaintance nearby with a video camera to document things in case he got arrested againhe said.

Mr. Credico’s father served time in jail for safe-cracking and later owned nightclubs in Californiawhere Mr. Credico grew up and began doing comedy and cocaine in back rooms with other entertainers. His played the circuit in Las Vegas and performed on “The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson” at age 27. He was the subject of a documentary called “60 Spins Around the Sun,” financed by Jack Blackand was featured alongside Russell Simmons in “LockdownUSA,” a documentary about the Rockefeller drug laws. He is the house comedian on the Albany radio show of Fred Dickera veteran New York Post reporter.

He jokes onstage that “Bloomberg” is Yiddish for “Giuliani,” and that narcotics agents in the city are truly undercover because “they leave their white sheets and hoods back on Long Island.”

Mr. Credico said his viewpoints were fostered by being around Mr. Kunstlerwho remains his hero and is memorialized inside 13 Gay Street by photographs on the wallalong with images of other counterculture icons like Che Guevara and Fidel Castro.

Mr. Credico met Mr. Kunstlerwhen an old sweetheartthe entertainer Joey Heathertonfaced criminal charges and needed a lawyer. Mr. Credico looked up Mr. Kunstlerwho took the case pro bono and took on Mr. Credico as a friend.

As Mr. Credico sat in the Kunstler house explaining all this last Mondaythe phone rang. He answered. It was an inmate with a drug case.

“Kunstler Fund.”

“Waitwhere are you? Rikers?”

“Soit wasn’t yours? Why did you plead out? Ohso you took the rap for your father then – I see. YeahI agree: A year and a half seems like a long sentence for a dime bag.”

“Listenwrite your whole story up for me in a letter and send it to meand I’ll see what I can do.”

Mr. Credico said that while spending his night in jail recentlymost of the other detainees he spoke to said they had been arrested on marijuana charges. He said he turned down a settlement offer in his case — one day of community service — because he wants to bring the case to trial for the publicity – representing himselfof course.

In the meantimehe saidhe would continue to take pictures of undercover police arresting pot smokersand warning people about smoking pot on Gay Street.

“ListenI don’t want people committing crimes on my street and I tell them not to,” Mr. Credico explained.

 5752,  1985, a, Dr. Cary Goodman was not satisfied with the kind of entertainment that children were getting. So three months agohe and some other grown-ups took crayons to paper and drew a picture of what a world's fair for youngsters would look like.

Their ideas came to life Saturday when a parade of children marched through the gates of the Asphalt Green in colorfulshimmering costumes to begin New York's first annual Children's Worlds Fair.

Performers came from as near as the city's own neighborhoods and as far as Crete. The Greek island sent a dance troupeand they joined other musicians and artists in the eight-hour festival.

Around the Asphalt Greenat 555 East 90th Streetexotic dances and songs were performed on stages representing five continents. Cardboard versions of an Egyptian pyramid and the Great Wall of China were displayed. So was a European castlethis one made of sand.
 3095,  2001, a, More than 150 community leaders and residents of Manhattan's East Sidesome pounding pots and pans and wearing gas masksprotested outside Consolidated Edison's power plant on East 14th Street yesterday and demanded that the utility make the plant environmentally safer before expanding it.

At the same timein a related matterMayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said in a news conference that unless electricity companies increase the amount of power they generateNew York could face an energy crisis like the one in California. ''We're about 350 to 400 megawatts short of where we should be for this summer,'' he said.

Con Edison plans to install new turbines at the East River plant on East 14th Street between Avenues C and D after the utility closes its Waterside steam plant on First Avenue between East 38th and East 40th Streets in Midtown. Last Novemberthe company agreed to sell the land on which the Waterside plant sits to a developer for $680 million. The process could take several years.

Led by the East River Environmental Coalitionresidents asked yesterday that Con Edison eliminate the use of diesel fuel at the East River plant and increase the size of its smoke stacks so that pollution from the plant could pass over the neighborhoodwhich some call Asthma Alley.

 1166,  2012, a, Slide 1 of 12,

Mets Manager Terry Collins checked on Johan Santana in the eighthwhen it seemed the entire infield was ready to argue against any move to remove him.
 3346,  2000, a, Mr. Fischlat any rateis a star. He hit it in the early 80's with his figurative paintingsmany of which involved disturbing sexual and social images in the supposedly safe setting of the suburbs. Mr. Fischl knew the suburbshaving been a Port Washington kid. One of his most talked about early works was ''Bad Boy,'' in which a woman lies naked on her bed while a young man reaches surreptitiously into her purse. This year a painting''Noonwatch,'' sold for $1 million. Mr. Fischl and his wifeApril Gornicka highly regarded landscape artisthave a home in Sag Harbor and a duplex in the Village.

This is all very impressive for someonewhoas Mr. Fischl says''wasn't a good kid.''

Mr. Fischl's father was a salesman. His mother? A brief pausethen an equally brief description. ''Housewife.'' Mr. Fischl speaks of flunking out of his first college; of living as a hippie in San Francisco; of his parents moving to the Southwest. But what he seems to enjoy discussing most is his work. He speaks wryly of trends in the art worlddryly funny in the style of Steve Martin and Mike Nicholswho are collectors and friends. When Mr. Fischl talks artit is often Art Forum sort of stuff:

''I was of a mind that you could paint from experience towards experience.'' Something feels as if it's missing. Could he give us a better sense of his parents?

The answer comes back so bluntly and directly it is like a shot.

''My mother was a ferocious alcoholic who ultimately killed herself,'' Mr. Fischl says. ''My father was trying to hold the whole thing together as best he could. And they just had this incredibly intensereally horrible relationship. She died in a car accident -- went out extremely drunkto run herself off the road. I was 22. She did not want to live. That's what I think.''

WHY was Mr. Fischl's mother so unhappy?

''Ahathe mystery of mysteries,'' Mr. Fischl says with a bitter and slightly unpleasant edge. ''I always thought she just lacked discipline. She was very creative and her fantasy of herself was as an artistand she always approached everything as if it had to be a masterpiece or it wasn't worth doing. She tried everything: paintingsculpturecraftswritingbut every time she put something out it was never good enoughit humiliated her.''

The painting ''Bad Boy'' shows a boy seemingly taking money from a purse. Was that boy ever Mr. Fischl?

 2293,  2006, a, Less than two minutes beforethe Texas A&M kicker Layne Neumann connected on a go-ahead 32-yard field goal.

Texas Tech (4-1) has now won five of its last six games against Texas A&M (4-1).

"The character that it takes to engineer a comeback like this is big," Texas Tech Coach Mike Leach said. "It's very gratifying."

Harrell completed 32 of 45 passes for 392 yards and 4 touchdownsthree of which were to Johnson. During the game-winning drivehe was 5 of 7 for 75 yards and Texas Tech had a fourth-down conversion inside its 40-yard line.

On his last touchdownHarrell said he recognized the blitz and called an audible for Johnson to run a streak pattern instead of a slant.

"Graham was calm out there the whole time," Johnson said. "He reminds me of Tom Brady."

The Aggies' last-minute meltdown Saturday is likely to turn up the heat on Franchionewho is paid an annual salary of $2 million. He is a woeful 1-3 versus the Red Raidersan unacceptable mark for a football-rich school that considers Texas its biggest rival and that expects to be a national power.

"This game is not the end to all wherewithal whether we had won the game or lost the game," Franchione said. "There's more critical important games to play."

On a sun-baked day in which temperatures hovered near 90 degreesthe Aggie defense reverted back to old habits Saturday under first-year defensive coordinator Gary Darnell.

Ranked 107th in total defense last yearTexas A&M was inept defensively in the early going. The Red Raiders feastedrolling up 297 of their 433 offensive yards in the first half for a 24-14 halftime lead.

Yet until Saturday's last-minute collapsethe Aggies played better defensively in the second halfallowing them to rally behind a ground attack that compiled 250 yards.

Of thatsophomore Jorvorskie Lane pounded out 77 yards and a touchdown on 12 carries.

Texas A&M tied the game at 24-24 on a 4-yard run by the junior fullback Chris Alexander with 8:44 left. The Aggies then grabbed the lead on Neumann's second field goalbut then came Texas Tech's late heroics.

"We had a maximum blitz and someone failed to make it maximum," said Darnell of the game-winning play.

The epitome of college football's hot coach when he arrived at Texas A&M in December 2002Franchione has thus far been unable to replicate his makeover magic in previous stops at AlabamaTexas Christian and New Mexico.

The Aggies are 20-20 during his four-year tenure and have advanced to the postseason only once. R.C. Slocumwhom Franchione replacedwas 21-15 in his last three years and led Texas A&M to bowl appearances in each of those seasons.

Although Texas A&M entered Saturday undefeatedits record was somewhat misleading.

Its four victories have come against teams that entering Saturday were a combined 6-11 this season. One of those wins included stopping Army just short of the end zone on the game's final play to escape with a 28-24 win.

Nearly an hour after Saturday's gamethe final score remained on some of Kyle Field's scoreboards as jubilant Texas Tech fans congregated near the Red Raider locker room.

The Aggies must still play OklahomaNebraska and at Texas.

Although Franchione wouldn't admit itSaturday's loss was clearly a setback for him and A&M.

"It's tough," he said.

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Rules are made to be broken. If this puzzle by Barry C. Silk had a themethat’s pretty much what it would be.

Broadly speakingit’s considered poor form to repeat a wordor come close to repeating a wordin the construction of a crossword puzzlebut in this case it’s a credit to both Mr. Silk and Will Shortz that they throw both GOOGLEPLEX and GOOGOLPLEX into a grid in a devil-may-care way and say“Look! We’re bending the rules and seeing where it takes us.” Both entries are crunchythey are spelled differentlythey each mean totally different thingsand personallyI think it makes the grid more interesting this way. In other wordsit’s meant to be a design featurenot a flaw. I’m not sure I would want a large dose of this sort of thing in my puzzlesbut once in a while there is nothing wrong with it. And it certainly makes the solving experience memorable. Six months from nowyou might not remember a Saturday with all different entriesbut I am willing to bet that you might say“Heyremember that time Barry Silk said GOOGLEPLEX twice?”

What is even more interesting to me is that Mr. Silk was able to fill his grid around this feature fairly well. There is some less-than-desirable stufflike SDS and some of the abbreviations buton balancethis worked for me. My gimmes were ORANGEMEN (Syracuse University is my alma mater)ROY ORBISONANDIE and GOOGLEPLEXwhich gave me a tremendous toehold in the puzzleespecially when you consider that the clues were fairly difficult.

And when I say difficultwhat I really mean is beautifully misdirected. I loved “Acronym associated with retirement?” for REM“Blade handle?” for the otherwise boring entry ATRA“Series of unknown challenges?” for algebra examand even “Place for a decorative clip,” sitting there so quietlywaiting for us to try to cram in BROOCH instead of EAR.

So when you see what looks like a duplicate entry in your puzzledon’t run for the NEAREST EXIT. Stop and consider whether it’s one of those puzzles that encourages us all to stretch our boundariesand whether you had fun doing it.

Let’s check in with Mr. Silk:

Constructor’s Notes:

GOOGOLPLEX and GOOGLEPLEX were the seeds for this puzzle. My first attempt at pairing these seeds symmetrically in a puzzle used a different grid pattern with the seeds at 1-Across and the last Across. That puzzle’s submission resulted in a rejection from Will Shortzbut with feedback saying he liked the the pairing of these seeds. SoI decided to try again using a different grid patternwhich was subsequently accepted. I constructed this particular puzzle in December 2013 andat that timeneither seed had appeared in a New York Times puzzle. This puzzle was accepted in April 2014.

In John Hughes’s 1986 movie“Pretty in Pink,” Molly Ringwald portrayed the heroine ANDIEbut it was Jon Cryer’s performance as the lovelorn Duckie that stood out — particularly in this scene — and made him a star:

 6427,  1970, a, YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARKCalif. — The crowds of vacationers are pouring into Yosemite again this summerbut here and elsewhere across the country there is a discernible difference from previous years: The visitors are spending less.

Some of the change traces to economic uncertainties and some to new tastes that have been created by new types of camping equipment.

Where once they happily rented tentsor cabins without plumbingnow they drive campers or pull trailers. As alternativesthey want the best accommodationsbut they may delay making reservations while they watch the stock market sag.

If there is a shortage of facilitiesit is at the top and bottom of the scale—shortages of luxury hotel roomsor of grassy plots where a bed roll can be flopped out.

This former actor - he is the owner of Sapore di Marewhich opened in Wainscott last Mayand the creator of the acclaimed Cantinori in Manhattan - has just written ''A Tuscan in the Kitchen'' (Clarkson N. Potter Inc.$24.95) to prove his point.

''The inspiration for a good Tuscan restaurant is home cooking,'' Mr. Luongo says in the introduction to his book. The foods that he knew from childhood in Florence are the ones detailed in this handsome work; they also represent many of the dishes served in his restaurants.

 2125,  2007, a, Antibacteria mania and germ-phobia — twin phenomena in a society increasingly obsessed by cleanliness — have been in full view amid all the public hoopla over MRSAthe drug-resistant staph infection that has caused a public health scare lately.

To prevent the spread of MRSApublic health authorities are urging people to wash their hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer; to cover all wounds with clean bandages; and to avoid sharing towels and razors. Those who share sporting equipment should clean it first with antiseptic solution.

But a state assemblyman from Brooklyn would like to take things a step further. The assemblymanDov Hikindannounced today that a hand-sanitizer manufacturer would distribute 10,000 hand-sanitizing “pens” for use by city schoolchildren.



“These GelRite pens are self-contained dispensers with alcohol-based hand sanitizer,” said Mr. Hikinda Democrat. “They’re compact and easy to use and will encourage students to clean their hands frequently. A few ounces of pen prevention are worth pounds of cure.”

The pens were made by DermaRitebased in PatersonN.J. The GelRite pens contain an antimicrobial waterless sanitizing gel that leaves “no sticky or tacky residue,” the company states on its Web site.

Hand sanitizers like Purell have become increasingly popularespecially among people with extensive contact with the public — like politicians.

The movement to create superhygienic environments has its skeptics. As Jane E. Brody has written in The Times“People frightened by a microbial world that harbors superbugs they believe are out to get them may be adopting an approach that actually fosters rather than suppresses serious infections.” Too much antimicrobial activity may be leading to the proliferation of antibiotic-resistant germs and weaker immune systems in children.

Mr. Hikind said he did not want to alarm parents. Since the authorities announced that a 12-year-old boy at a Brooklyn middle school who died this month was infected with MRSAthe authorities have been trying to reassure parents. Mr. Hikind says it is fine to be reassuredbut even better to be prepared.

“We don’t want to scare parentsbut we have to make parents and students aware: This bacteria is opportunistic — an open cut or sore and it can enter the bloodstream,” he said. “Tell your children again and again: WashCleanseCover. We can try to control the spread of MRSAbut it’s going to take a new way of thinking and a new way of behavingand carrying a hand sanitizer pen with you is a great step forward.”
 4393,  1994, a, To the Editor:

I spent America's Election Day in Chiapasthe southernmost Mexican stateas part of a delegation sent by Global Exchangea San Francisco-based human rights organization. While California's voters and Gov. Pete Wilson have spent a great deal of time considering the audacity of those who cross our borders illegallyI wonder how much they've pondered what makes these people leave everyone and everything behind?

That became clear to me on Nov. 13the day I encountered the peasants who had lived on an ejidoa communal farmcalled Patricio. Two days earlierthey saidthey were violently dislodged from their homes by armed gunmen hired by the wealthier local landowners. These people told of being terrorized for three days by the gunmen until they finally agreed to abandon their farmif only they would first be allowed to gather their few belongings -- few because their life is one of subsistence farmingwhere they live in homes with dirt floorsusually without running water or electricity.

They collected their possessions and thenthey saidwere forced to watch as the landowners' thugs burned themincluding the four vehicles they had for 350 people. A child lying inside one of these vehicles was incinerated. Five were shot and wounded. More than 20 menI was toldwere "disappeared" after their heads were shaved and they'd felt the searing pain of a rifle butt in the groin. (One of these men was eventually found dead on another ejido.)

As the rest of the peasants were loaded into buses to be taken awaythey saidthe gunmen threw gasoline on the vehicles and tried to set them alight. Fortunatelythey were unsuccessfuland the screaming occupants escaped with the clothes on their backs.
 208,  2018, a, When Amazon announced last week that it was buying the online pharmacy PillPackit sent stocks of drugstore companies like Walgreens and Rite Aid tumblingas investors worried that the retail behemoth would soon upend the pharmacy market.

But even though Amazon has transformed the way Americans buy products as different as books and diapersit may not have such an easy time with prescription drugs. That’s because to succeedit will have to do business with powerful entrenched companies who are not necessarily wishing Amazon well.

As a relatively small pharmacy with about $100 million in annual revenuesPillPack most likely didn’t attract much attention from the pharmacy industry’s giantssaid Eric Percheran equity research analyst at Nephron Research.

“I think they have absolutely been able to fly under the radar,” he said. But now that a household name like Amazon is buying the company“the entities that have enabled PillPack’s success — whether they knew it or not — have a decision to make,” he said.

 540,  2016, a, “Making connections with other Christiansas well as Muslim and Jewish womenhas probably been the most exciting benefit of blogging,” says Liz Roya Christian who runs the personal style blog Downtown Demure. “We all have different standards for modestybut we share this common goalwhich can be a bit contradictory to secular standards.”

These connections have the potential to yield more than just warmfuzzy feelingsaccording to the Jewish Orthodox sisters Simi and Chaya Gestetner of the modest indie label the Frock. While they enjoy the personal connections they build with customers of any faith (including their Orthodox neighbors in Brooklyn and their Mormon fans in Salt Lake City)they also see the mobilization of the modest-fashion community as a real boon for business.

The sisters report seeing a significant increase in sales every time the Jewish Orthodox street style star Adi Heyman posts Instagram images of herself wearing their piecesoften mixed with separates from brands like Gucci or Chanel. Since Ms. Heyman’s blogFabologieflows from her desire to find more modest options in mainstream fashionthe continued success of brands like the Frock is something she is deeply invested in.

And while linking commerce and religion may seem distasteful to somemodest-fashion entrepreneurs like Melanie Elturk see it as a natural way to live out their faith and serve their communities. Ms. Elturka former lawyer who founded the online retailer Haute Hijab in 2010uses her online following to offer style inspiration and practical resources to young Muslim women who are seeking to honor the tradition of wearing hijabs in the face of cultural pushback.

“I have a whole network of psychiatriststherapistssocial workers and community leaders who I put in touch with girls who are struggling so they can hash out any issues,” said Ms. Elturkwhose responsive social media presence engages many younger followers. “I want to see a thriving community of girls who are proud to wear hijab.”

 5202,  1988, a, For decadeslawyers have been talking about the desirability of a national bar examinationbut progress in that direction has been painfully slow.

''The practice of law in America is interstate these daysbut the bar exam is a hanging-on from days gone byan old states' rights issue,'' said Norman Krivoshaformer Chief Justice of the Nebraska Supreme Courtwho has long argued for a national bar exam.

This yearfor the first timethe mechanism for such an examination will be in place.

In most statesthe bar examination is administered over two dayswith multiple-choice questions asked on one day and essays written on the other. Since 1972 each state has had the option of replacing its multiple-choice test with 200 computer-graded questions. All butLouisianaWashingtonIndiana and Iowa are using the questions in the multistate test. Essay Questions Prepared

Now the National Conference of Bar Examiners is preparing a set of essay questions the states can use. Six states have already agreed to use those questionsand others are expected to follow suit.

 2694,  2003, a, So what does Tyco International look like without the accounting gimmickry? Tyco's chief executiveEdward D. Breenacknowledged yesterday that it is not the fast-growthhigh-margin collection of assets that L. Dennis Kozlowskithe former chief executiveloved to compare to General Electric.

StillMr. Breen proudly proclaimed in a conference call with investors that ''we're going to grow this business back for the future,'' now that Tyco has completed its internal investigationwhich uncovered a pattern of aggressive accounting and prompted a $382 million restatement in earnings.

But the company will never be the Tyco that Mr. Kozlowski dreamed of.

The new Tycothough still viableis what skeptics always thought it was: a hodgepodge of consistently profitable but unconnectedslow-growth businesses that produced things as diverse as surgical gear and home-security systems. Mr. Breen's reiterated earnings forecast for 2003 of $1.50 to $1.75 a share acknowledged as much.

Without a steady stream of acquisitions -- and the artificially inflated earnings boost that Tyco engineered for the first couple of quarters after each deal was completed -- the consistent growth that made Tyco a highflying stock in the last couple of years is over. And there is going to be a bumpy road ahead.

 2832,  2003, a, Cellphones are a boon to stagecraft. With only a small clutch of electronics pressed to the headcharacters can now convincingly perform monologues anywhere: in carson the beachin the tub. ''Karen Sisco,'' which has its premiere tonightexploits this devicespinning drama chiefly from close-ups on the radiantly made-up face of Carla Guginothe show's staras she bathespaces and drives in Miami. Andall the whiletalks into her flip-top mobile.

Sisco begins the pilot with a bad hangover. She is an alcoholic United States marshal who can't remember a recent shootout that knocked her out and garishly wounded her chest. As she tries to rememberthe show joins its amnesia plot with a sleeping-with-the-enemy plot in a two-for-one evening of favorite action formulas.

''Karen Sisco'' is driven by a soundtrack of cool jazz -- easy listening that may remind viewers of being on hold. But on hold for what? The show seems to promise disclosures and entanglementsbut by the end of the first episode nothing seems to have happened. An intricate romance simply evaporatesand Sisco gives no clue about why it even got started.

Stillyour call is important to ABCand it's worth standing by for the second episode of ''Karen Sisco,'' which will be shown next Wednesday. A prisoner sees an unexpected chance to escape his handlerand he flees. Siscowho could have apprehended himalso accidentally lets him go. This time she is not morally remote or immune to change. Rathershe seems to have lost her virtuosity as a marshal even before the show can establish it.

d. What can archeologists learn from preserving these petroglyphs?

3. Display representative works of art from a variety of periods and places and showing a variety of styles. Use these to elicit students’ views and ideas about the value of artthe role it plays in reflecting the period and place in which it was createdand particular artistic styles and media. Get the discussion going with these questions:

a. Do you think it’s important to preserve the petroglyphs described in the article? Why or why not?

b. Why are the petroglyphs important to Native Americans today? Are they important to other Americans? What about people from other countries? Explain your ideas.

Students may make their choices based on historical events or periods (e.g.the Colonial period in the U.S.) or personal interest. Once they have chosen the period and the placestudents conduct research to learn about the art of that time and place and relate it to culture and history. Ask students to prepare presentations (multimedia if possible) in which they address these questions:

a. Is there a particular artistic style that is identified with this period and place?

b. Who were the most prominent artists of this period and place?

c. What are the key features of this period and place in relation to culturesocietypoliticseconomicsscienceand technology?

d. What literary works are associated with this time and place?

Set aside class time for students to make presentations of their work to the class..

Further Questions for Discussion:

–If you were an artisthow would you ensure that your work was accessible to people living 100 years from now and beyond?

–In what other ways is technology being used to preserve artinformationand other “products” of today for the future? Give several examples.

–If you were going to paint a picture that told an important story or conveyed an important idea about the world in which you livewhat would be in that painting?

 5064,  1989, a, As for Ms. Rolleher matriarch is made up largely of posings and sermonizings. ''You were supposed to be my beginning again,'' she rebukes her son. ''You were supposed to be my harvest.'' Who wouldn't go out for a drink?

More human are Lena's son35-year-old Walter Lee (Danny Glover) and his hard-working wifeRuth (Starletta DuPois). Walter Leethe household's solitary manis at the center of the plot. Frustrated by his feelings of powerlessnessfed up with his job as a chauffeurdesperate to prove himselfhe invests most of his father's insurance money with a neighborhood hustler. When Rutha part-time domestic workerwho wants mainly her husband's lovelearns that she is pregnant (the audience learns it when she faints at the end of a scenesure evidence of pregnancy in the theater)she is driven to consider an abortion.

Ms. DuPois doesn't have much to do except show distress at distressing eventsbut she manages to seem solid and believable. Mr. Glover does enough emoting for both of them. He carries conviction in his quieter momentsbut much of the time he is contorting his big frame and throwing himself around the furniture and on the floor; he rants incessantly and perspires prodigiously. When he hears that his mother is planning to use the insurance payment to buy a house instead of entrusting the money to himhe crunches a glass in his handsure evidence of agitation in the theater.

Egged on by the emotion-wringing direction of Bill Dukeall the characters keep yelling at one another or weeping with one another about moneyindependencefamily pride and so forth. They seem not to trust the audience to detect a feeling unless it is shouted or bawled. The cameraoften stopping the action to hold a reaction and lingering over limp jokesaccentuates the play's weaknesses and strains the patience of even a sympathetic viewer.

Mr. Duke sensibly does not try to open things up by taking the characters out of their apartmentbut he has been unable to resist shooting periodically through a kitchen window so that Lena's favorite plantsitting symbolically on the sill in a bit of suncan occupy the foreground.

 3575,  1998, a, At the Folksbiene Yiddish Theaterthe vehicle creaksbut the ride packs enjoyment.

The company that bills itself as the nation's oldest Yiddish-speaking theater is off and running in its 82d year of continuous performances with ''The Blacksmith's Folly,'' a musical drama based on one of David Pinski's Yiddish classics''Yankl der Schmid'' (''Yankl the Smith'').

Playing until Jan. 18 and accompanied by simultaneous English and Russian translations through earphonesthis is a work that poses a question -- can the leopard change his spots? -- and then proceeds to take its sweet time delivering a predictable answer.

But there is plenty of fun and pleasure along the way: neatly acted characters who radiate soula journey into both old-time theater and Ukraine of 1906warm humorconcern for decencysprightly and sentimental music and lyrics and the singing of a baritone named Alexander Gunko.

Mr. Gunkoa graduate of the State Conservatory of Music in Odessa in Ukrainepossesses a beautiful voice and the ability to imbue a song with depths of feeling; although he plays a subsidiary rolea character called The Strangerthis production wisely uses him as much as possible.

 4083,  1996, a, In a November 1995 ruling that upheld the zoning ordinance limiting the height of the landfill to 90 feetSuperior Court Judge Charles D. Gill noted that Waste Management had made approximately $50 million in gross revenue during the two preceding years in which the validity of the ordinance was being appealed.

The appeal now pending in the State State Supreme Court is the second time the case has been before the state's highest court. In July 1995the court ruled 5-0 in favor of the town's position. That decision reversed two lower court rulings that had gone in favor of Waste Management in 1993. And those proceedings had been in the legal pipeline going back to 1990. But as early as 1985Waste Management had apparently caught town officials off guard when it petitioned the state for permission to expand the dump to 190 feet from 90 feet.

While Waste Management published a notice of its application for a modified permit in local newspapers''no comments were received from New Milford town officials,'' the Supreme Court ruling noted. After the State Department of Environmental Protection granted the permit in February 1987''no appeal was taken'' by the townthe court said.

Liba Furhmanthe New Milford Mayor from 1991 until last yearsaid that zoning officials never received notice of the permit application; her predecessorsince deceaseddenied any knowledge of the applicationwhich would have gone to his office first. And the newspaper notice was publishedshe saidon New Year's Evedrewing no notice in the town.

Mrs. Furhmana Democratalso noted that the town was handicapped in its dispute with Waste Management because of its lateness in adopting zoning regulations. New Milford wasshe saidone of the last municipalities in the state to adopt relevant zoning regulations.

In 1971 the town adopted zoning statutes that prohibited a landfill in an industrial zone. But the landfill on Route 7 existed prior to the regulations and it thus became a ''permitted nonconforming use,'' the court decisions have noted. The prior owner of the dump had received a permit from the state to operate the landfill to a maximum height of 90 feetafter which the subsequent ownerWaste Managementsought and received permission to increase the height to 190 feet leading to the legal confrontation.

''It is a period in my life that I'd like to forget,'' Mrs. Furhman said of the town's fight with Waste Management.

 4960,  1990, a, Q. Is it hard on a dog or cat to be left alone all day?

A. It's hard on dogsbecause they're social animals. Their ancestors and relatives live in packs. So having more than one dog would be bestbecause they love the companionship. Howeverif you can't do thatyou can put the dog in a crate when you're not thereand they'll feel more secure. Take wolves or coyotesfor instance. When the parents are out huntingthey leave the pups in a small enclosed area of the den that's very confined. But when dogs are in an open space all alone and unprotectedthen they're going to feel unsure and insecure.

Catsbeing lonersdon't want other cats around. In factthey are the only domestic animal that are loners. A lot of people think that since they're off working during the day that they should get a companion for their cat so it won't be lonely. But a cat sees another cat as someone invading his territory.

Sometimes two cats will get along fineespecially if they are from the same litter and have grown up together. But sometimeswhen you have two cats togetheryou might find that even though they are getting alongone of them may be urinating around the house to show that he or she is dominant. If someone really wants a companion for a catthoughyou can avoid all those problems by getting the cat a dog.

The cat can ignore a dog; cats can ignore anything but another cat. The dog loves itbecause it's another living thing there. It's not alone. The thing that comes to mind is Garfield. He would be very happy if Odiethe dogwalked off the end of the earth. Whereas Odie absolutely adores Garfieldhe follows him everywhere. But you never see Garfield following Odie. Now there's a cartoonist who knows his pets.

Q. What's the best way to housebreak a dog?

A. Usually by putting the dog in a crate or a very confined space when you're not aroundbecause puppies are not going to soil their own nest. Usually a kitchen is going to be on the large side. You can put them in the bathroom or some place that is very small. At the same timeyou have to encourage them to do it outside. When you let them out in the morningfor instancetake them right outsidethen praise them. Then wait until they goand praise them again. It will take several weeksbut the dog will eventually begin to show you when he wants to go out.

Q. How common is feline leukemia?

A. It's not all that easy to pick upbecause most animals have the ability to fight off diseases. In one study on feline leukemiathey found that 40 percent of cats have a natural immunity to the disease. Another study involving stray cats that have been exposed to the virus found that two-thirds of those cats have been able to throw off the virus.

Q. What are the symptoms of Lyme disease in animals?

A. What you usually see is some kind of lethargy and joint problems. There's a noticeable change in behavior. If it is not treatedit can go on to affect the kidneys and other organs. They have not yet developed a vaccine for the disease.

 2731,  2003, a, It has been more than two years since a federal appeals court ruled that Wilbert Rideau had to be set free or retried for shooting three people during a 1961 robbery and then cutting the throat of a woman as she tried to crawl away.

In that timethe district attorney here has engineered the selection of a white judge to retry the casewon the disqualification of the black judge who replaced himand fought to keep the case before a third judge who had worked in the district attorney's office for 11 years. Mr. Rideau is black and his victims were white.

Forty-two years after the crimethe district attorneyRick Bryantis determined to convict Mr. Rideau for a fourth time and ensure that the key to his freedom is thrown away for good. Todaythe third judge was disqualified for conflict of interestand Mr. Bryant immediately moved to appeal.

The defense is equally hard-nosed in arguing that Mr. Rideau has paid his debt to society fullyif not fourfoldconsidering that until the 1970's people sentenced to life in Louisiana were often paroled after 10 or 15 years. Mr. Rideau -- who is technically in pretrial detention and was even eligible to vote in last fall's elections -- has still not tasted a day of liberty.

 331,  2017, a, It has become one of the knottier puzzles on Wall Street.

As political risks have increased at home and abroadcomplacency among investors has rarely been so widespread.

This trendwhich began soon after President Trump’s victory in Novemberculminated on Mondaywhen the VIX indexknown widely as Wall Street’s fear gaugedipped briefly below 10 — the first time it had done so in more than 10 yearsin the months before the financial crisis.

The VIX measures investor expectations that stock markets will move sharply up or down.

On Tuesdaythe VIX turned upto close at about 10.6 — but still sharply lower than its historical average of roughly 20. At current levelsthe VIX reflects a striking sense among investors that the persistent rise in stocks would continueregardless of election fears in Europe and concerns here that Mr. Trump might not deliver on his ambitious economic agenda.

“The pricing of risk is at near historic lowsand the pricing of the stock market is at near historic highs,” said Julian Emanuela stock and derivatives specialist at the investment bank UBS. “And all of this at a time when political risk is very elevated — at home and abroad.”

 2814,  2003, a, The majority of the 51 seats of the New York City Council were filled with fresh faces two years agothanks to a new term-limits law. This November the usual four-year term is shortened by half to allow for a post-census redistricting and all the seats are up for grabs again. But even abbreviated incumbency has its benefits. Only a few members of the Democrat-dominated Council face serious challenges in the Sept. 9 primary. These are The Times's endorsements for some of the most heavily contested races in Manhattan:

Eighth District (East Harlemthe Mott Haven section of the Bronx and part of the Upper West Side): The incumbentPhilip Reedis facing a vigorous challenge from Melissa Mark-Viveritoa member of Community Board 11 in Spanish Harlem and an activist who understands issues most important to its residents. She is Puerto Rican bornan advantage in a district with a majority-Latino population.

Mr. Reed is African-Americanbut his Latino constituents have been among those benefiting from his Council tenure since 1998. While his most-noticed action this term was fathering the ban on cellphone use in theatersMr. Reed has a much fuller résumé. On workers' rightswomen's rightstenant protections and services for the elderlyhis record is exemplary. In Spanish Harlem the epidemic of asthma among children is being addressed -- and is in decline -- due in part to the attention Mr. Reed won for the problem. While his Spanish admittedly is in a learning stageMr. Reed is fluent in the language of an effective councilman. We endorse Mr. Reed for another term on the City Council.

10th District (Washington HeightsInwood): Miguel Martinezthe first-term incumbentis a likablelow-key politician. But a district with desperate problems like a lack of affordable housing and severely overcrowded classrooms would benefit from an infusion of independent ideas and energy. Ydanis Rodrigueza teacher and grass-roots organizer who has worked with immigrant children and created a local college preparatory programhas demonstrated a special kind of vitality in pressing for better services for the community. Recentlywhen the subway stop at 191st Street was closed for repairs through the end of the yearMr. Rodriguez led a successful effort to get shuttle service for residents. We endorse Ydanis Rodriguez.

 6050,  1977, a, Governor Carey said yesterday that rents in rent‐controlled or stabilized apartments should be related to the tenants' ability to pay “so that those who need rent control will have itand those who don't need it and can afford higher rents will pay them.”

The proposal could mean higher costs for thousands of tenants in New York City and other parts of the state.

He announced that he was forming a “task force” to develop a “needs‐based. rent‐control system” as part of efforts to change the present rent laws. Any such system would have to be approved by the Legislature before it could be adopted.

The Governor's statementsmade during and after a meeting of corporate executives and members of the Regional Plan Associationimmediately drew fire from a major tenants' groupbut were applauded in varying degrees by real‐estate spokesmen.

 4768,  1991, a, Mr. Brown said in a recent interview that he had been eager to have the Annenberg show appear in Washingtonalthough by 1989 he was fairly sure the bequest would go to the Met. He had made his pitch for the bequest in January 1988 when he wrote to Mr. Annenberg sketching out some ideas about how his collection might be presented in the National Gallery.

He emphasized the advantages of his museum as part of a complex of national museums with an encylopedic rangefor having a large attendance and for the patriotic appeal of its being in the national capital.

Mr. Annenberg wrote back immediately saying it was "proper to advise" Mr. Brown that a delegation from the Met Museum would be visiting him in a few weeks. Since Mr. Brown heard no more on the subject he assumed that his rivals at the Met had sewed up the deal.

That was not quite the case. The director and trustees of the Met had been pointedly mentioning to Mr. Annenberg what their museum could do for his collectionand vice versafor more than a decade. "There is a time to praise and a time to ask," said Philippe de Montebellodirector of the Metsaid recently of these early conversations. 'What's Going On Here?'

The time to ask was hastened by news of the traveling show.

"We knew about the show being in Philadelphia," William H. Luerspresident of the Metropolitan said the other day"but when we learned it was going to Los Angeles and Washington toowe said'What's going on here?' We knew we had to put together a plan."

Relations between Mr. Annenberg and the Met had reached a low point in 1977 when he withdrew an offer of $40 million to create a fine arts "communication center" at the museum after the proposal was criticized on both philosophical and practical grounds.
 4373,  1994, a, To the Editor:

Jesse Zel Lurie (letterSept. 23)contends that Israel should surrender the strategic Golan Heights to Syria because "it's either peace now or war later."

Israel's top military experts seem to disagree. The Israeli Army chief of staffGen. Ehud Barakremarked in Washington recently that "from a professional military standpointas long as there is no peace we need every meter of the Golan Heightsand also at a time of peace we had better stay on the Golan Heights."

Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechaihead of Israel's northern commandcalled the Golan "a quiet volcano" because Syria has "the power to change the situation from one of peace and quiet in a fairly short time . . . In such circumstancesthe Golan is an important strategic asset and security region for the country's north."

 4319,  1994, a, "I bought it in a large amount initially expecting it to sell because the Elton John single is already out," said Lal Sarjuthe store's soundtrack buyerreferring to "Can You Feel the Love Tonight." "But when the movie comes outI expect to sell a couple hundred pieces a week."

Buyers at record and toy stores agree sales of the soundtrack will probably be sluggish until the movie opensbut they're hoping airplay and the pre-release hype will help. "There's already been a lot of anticipation," Lew Garrettthe vice president of purchasing for the 430-store chain Camelot Musicsaid. "I think it has the potential to be one of the biggest hits of the summer. We certainly bought it that way." Beastie Boys With Monks

The Beastie Boys were the last band anyone expected to get political. The hip-hop trio's first full-length album"Licensed to Ill" in 1986was a boy's night outcrammed with tales of drinking and partying. Their most recent album"Ill Communication" (Grand Royal/Capitol)released yesterdaysounds more like the morning after. It's sleepy and sprawlingheavy and reflective. "The earth needs to be respected," Adam Yauch (a k a MCA) raps on "The Update." "It's been far too long that she's been neglected."

On Friday night at the Academythe Beastie Boys -- Michael Diamond (Mike D)Adam Horovitz (King Adrock) and Mr. Yauch -- put their money where their mouths are. The surprise performanceannounced the day of the showwas a benefit for Artists for Tibeta national campaign to preserve Tibetan culture. Also on the bill were Luscious Jacksona female punkfunk and hip-hop quartet that includes the former Beastie Boys drummerKate Schellenbachand the Tibetan Ganden Jangtse Monks.

"I don't think most of our audience has ever seen something like the monks," Mr. Yauch29said from his parents' home in Brooklyn hours before the show"and I definitely don't think the monks have ever seen the kind of insanity that goes on at our concerts before. Hopefully it will run smoothly. The main thing we're hoping to do with the concert is bring about some more awareness about what's happening in Tibetespecially among younger people."
 194,  2018, a, Mayor Bill de Blasio is championing a plan that would make New York City a pioneer in creating supervised injection sites for illegal drug userspart of a novel but contentious strategy to combat the epidemic of fatal overdoses caused by the use of heroin and other opioids.

Safe injection sites have been considered successful in cities in Canada and Europebut do not yet exist in the United States. Leaders in San FranciscoPhiladelphia and Seattle have declared their intention to create supervised sitesalthough none have yet done so because of daunting obstacles. Among them: The sites would seem to violate federal law.

The endorsement of the strategy by New Yorkthe largest city in the countrywhich last year saw 1,441 overdose deathsmay give the movement behind it impetus.

For the sites to openNew York City must still clear some significant hurdles. At minimumthe plan calls for the support of several district attorneysandmore criticallythe State Department of Healthwhich answers to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. The city sent a letter on Thursday to the stateasserting its intention to open four injection centers.

 4426,  1993, a, The Talking Band has a long history of treating topical subjects in imaginatively oblique ways. And "The Blue Sky Is a Curse," a trilogy of surreal music-theater pieces whose title was inspired by a Magritte paintingis typical of the whimsical approach taken by the venerable experimental ensemble.

Its three related vignettesall set in Los Angeles during the 1992 riotsevoke personal alienation against a canvas of violent social upheaval. In Paul Zimet's three-character play "Baron Bones," an agoraphobic poet (Tom Nelis) and his Eastern European girlfriend (Terry McCarthy) exchange opposite views of Los Angeles. When she leaveshe is visited by a potion-peddling black shaman (William Badgett)who takes him on a mental journey into the heart of the riots.

"Brown Dog Is Dead," which was written and composed by Ellen Maddowportrays elderly immigrantsNino and Pearl (Mr. Zimet and Tina Shepard) who bickerreminisceand fret about what to do because a Social Security computer has registered Pearl as deceased. As Nino drifts into surrealistic reveries and mysterious leaks appear in the housethe play produces a dizzying sense of a tiny world crumbling to bits inside of a larger one that is going up in flames.

The two vignettes are linked by the musicalized sounds of the plumbers working in the building where the characters live. And the final pieceMs. Maddow's one-act opera"The Plumber's Helper," focuses on the plumbers (Mr. BadgettMs. MaddowMs. McCarthy) who bemoan their frustrating love lives. Their confessions suggest a modern-day variation on Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night," in the language of contemporary sexual politics.

Stress fractures are one of the more pernicious injuries in sportsafflicting the experienced and the aspiringwith no regard for competitive timing. Last yearTiger Woods managed to win the U.S. Open despite suffering from stress fractures in his left leg (as well as other leg and knee injuries)while the great British marathoner Paula Radcliffe struggled through the Beijing Olympics Marathon on a leg barely recovered from a stress fractureone of several she’s suffered. The International Association of Athletics Federationsthe world governing body for track and fieldrecently described stress fractureswith a kind of grim resignationas “the curse of athletes.”

But studies published in this month’s issue of the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise offer hope thatat least for runnerssimple alterations in their stride or in the strength of their legs might reduce their risk for the most common type of stress fracture.

In one of the studiesundertaken at the University of Minnesotaresearchers recruited 39 competitive women runnersages 18 to 35and started measuring them. In particularthe scientists wanted to examine the size and shape of their shinbonesor tibias. About half of all stress fractures occur in the tibiastudies show. When you run or jumpthat bone is pulled and bent. Sometimesmicroscopic fissures form. In most casesthese tiny cracks heal quickly. Butsometimescontinued activity overwhelms the bone’s capacity to recover. The cracks grow and combine into a fracture.

The Minnesota researchers wanted to see whether the shinbones of the runners with a history of stress fractures were weaker than those without. Earlier studies suggested that this would be the case. But few studies have examined the size of the runners’ calf muscles. Bones tend to adapt to the muscles around them; puny muscles can mean puny bones. The Minnesota scientistsusing a new machine that examines bone in three dimensions and measuring the runners’ leg musclesfound thatsurprisinglythe injured runners’ bones were as strongin relation to their muscle size as the bones in the uninjured runners. But the injured runners had significantly smaller calf muscles and therefore also slighter bones. The primary differencethe researchers concludedbetween the women who suffered stress fractures and those who hadn’t was the size (and presumably strength) of their calf muscles.

This finding should be encouraging to anyone who has had a tibial stress fracture or would prefer not to. “It does seem as if strengthening the calf muscles may be a very easy way” to reduce fracture risksays Moira Petitan associate professor of kinesiology at the University of Minnesota and an author of the study. In additionshe said“our data suggest that you don’t have to strengthen the muscle by much.” A small increase of bulkachievable byfor instancerising up on to your toes and sinking back to the floor 10 or 12 times every daymight be enough. Adding even a small amount of calf muscle “serves two purposes,” Ms. Petit says. First“the strength of the bone will usually increase” in response to the added muscle. Andas a bonusthe new muscle “can absorb more” of the forces generated when you run. So even as the tibia strengthens in response to the new muscleit also is subjected to less shock. “Reallythere’s no downside to this,” Ms. Petit says.

Her resultsthoughmay apply primarily to women; she’s studying male runnersbut so farshe saysisn’t seeing the same relationship between their calf-muscle size and bone strength. The other study in the current Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercisehoweverdid focus on men and their stress fracturesalthoughin this casethe lead researcher suggests that the findings would be true in women as well. In the workfrom Iowa State University in Amescomputer modeling was used to predict what would happen to stress fracture risk if runners changed their strides. The researchers attached reflective markers to the bodies of 10 former or current collegiate-level cross-country runners and had them run repeatedly down a runway nearly 30 meters longmaking sure to step onto a force plate that measured how hard they were striking the ground. During successive runsthe men were asked to shorten their natural strideswhile maintaining their pace. The scientists entered the data into computer programs that calculated just how much force was being applied to the shinbone under different striding conditions. The researchers determined that reducing stride length by about 10 percent seemed to reduce the stress on the tibia enough to lower the risk of a stress fracture.

Whythoughshould shortening your stride affect your tibia at all? “Think of it this way,” says Brent Edwardslead author of the study and now a post-doctoral research fellow in the Department of Kinesiology and Nutrition at the University of Illinoisin Chicago. “If you spend less time in the flight phase of running” — meaning in the air — “you’ll hit the ground with less force.” On the other handyou’ll hit the ground more often. But in Mr. Edwards’s modelsthe reduction in pounding from an abbreviated stride outweighed the shock from a few additional strides per mile.

Even for those of us without a biomechanical expert in the housegauging a 10 percent reduction in stride is not difficultMr. Edwards says. “Ten percent is about as much as you can shorten your stride without it beginning to feel quite uncomfortable,” he says. And absolute precision isn’t necessary. “Seven or eight or nine percent is fine,” he says.

Neither Ms. Petit nor Mr. Edwards suggestsof coursethat anysingle prevention approach will end all tibial stress fractures. “There are so many elements involved,” Ms. Petit says. Traininghormonesgeneticsdiet and shoe choice probably all play a role. “But if there’s something easy and benign that you can do to lessen the risk,” she asks“why not?”

Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lessonstudents rate a variety of kid-friendly museum Web sites for both their educational and entertainment value. They then reflect in writing about the overall success of each site to pique their interest in artsciencehistory or culture.



Author(s):

Clayton DeKorneThe New York Times Learning Network

Yasmin Chin EisenhauerThe Bank Street College of Education in New York City

Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour

Objectives:

Students will: 1. Reflect on how they use the Internet outside of school and factors that make an entertainment Web site educational.

2. Learn about how museums are reaching out to younger audiences by reading and discussing the article “Surprise! Educational Sites Are Cool.”

3. In groupsevaluate the contentstructure and navigationvisual designfunctionalityinteractivity and overall experience of various museum Web sites.

4. Individuallyreflect in writing about the overall success of the Web site they reviewed.

Resources / Materials:

–student journals

–pens/pencils

–paper

–classroom blackboard

–copies of “Surprise! Educational Sites Are Cool” (one per student)

–computers with Internet access (one per group)

Activities / Procedures:

1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Students respond to the following prompt (written on the board prior to class): “How do you use the Internet outside of school (and not related to homework)? Do you ever go to the Web to learn about favorite sportshobbieseventsor topics of particular interest to you? Explain. Would you consider any of this non-school-related Web activity educational? Why or why not?” After a few minutesallow students to share their responses. Then as a class discuss the following question: What would a make an educational Web site fun?

2. As a classread and discuss the article “Surprise! Educational Sites Are Cool,” focusing on the following questions:

a. What painting was George Tamburino investigating online?

b. How old is George?

c. On what trend with museums does this article focus?

d. What age groups has the Museum of Modern Art targeted online?

e. According to the articlewhat do museums hope to gain by developing Web sites for young people?

f. In what other ways have museums made use of the Internetaccording to the article?

g. According to Jennifer Trantwhy are education sites doing well?

h. Are the museum sites achieving their goalsaccording to the sources cited in the article? 3. Divide the class into six groupsand assign each group one of the following Web sites:

–Smithsonian Education (//smithsonianeducation.org/students/index.html)

–MOMA RedStudio (//redstudio.moma.org/)

–Exploratorium Science of Music (//www.exploratorium.edu/music/index.html)

–Learning @ Whitney (//whitney.org/learning/)

–AMNH Ology (//www.ology.amnh.org/)

–NGA Kids (//www.nga.gov/kids/)

Explain to students that each group will act as a team of curatorial advisors to evaluate a museum Web site targeted at kids. Each group will be evaluating the sites and offering their recommendations for changes and improvements to enhance the site’s educational and entertainment value. Each group should divide themselves into five subgroupsaccording to the following categories (copied in a handout or on an overhead for easier student access):

–How appropriate is the technology used on this site for the type of content being delivered to target users?

–How efficiently do pages load? Would this site work on a dial-up connection or does a user need a high-speed connection?

–Do all the links work?

–Weighing all the above factorsassign a value to this site’s functionality on a scale of 1 (poor) to 6 (excellent).

INTERACTIVITY

–Who is the target audience for this site?

–In what ways (searcheschat rooms or messaginggamesfeedbackparticipation in activitiesetc.) does this site encourage users to interact with the content? List all that apply.

–How does this interactivity enhance a user’s understanding of the content?

–Weighing all the above factorsassign a value to this site’s interactivity on a scale of 1 (poor) to 6 (excellent).

[Note: These categories are adapted from the Webby Awards judging criteria (//www.webbyawards.com/main/webby_awards/criteria.html). Students should be encouraged to read the category criteria on this page before assigning a rating.]

After 10 to 15 minutesallow each group to come together to discuss the Overall Experience of their site. Students should add up their category rating pointsand assign a rating value to the site as a whole on a scale of 1 to 30. Depending on the group’s consensusthey may wish to alter the rating up or down if they feel one category has a particularly strong influence on a user’s overall experience. In additionstudents in each group should discuss whether the rating applies more to the site’s educational or entertainment valueor bothand be prepared to defend their judgments.

4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: In a future classallow groups to present an evaluation of each Web siteand allow students to ask questions about each category. As homeworkeach student should also respond to the following prompt: “Think about the Web site you explored in class. Thenbased your memory of the siteanswer the following questions: What did you like the best about the site? What did you like the least? Do you think the site was an effective place for learning about artsciencehistory or culture? Explain. Would you be inclined to visit this site again outside the classroom? Why or why not?”

Further Questions for Discussion:

–What museums have you visited? Which ones stood out as providing an especially positive or negative experience? Explain why.

–Do you feel that information found on the Internet is equallymoreor less reliable than information from other sources? Why or why not?

–What do you think makes a work of art “good” or “bad”?

–Do you think art should be included in a school’s core curriculum along with subjects like mathematicsscience and language arts? Why or why not?

Evaluation / Assessment:

Students will be evaluated based on initial journal writingthoughtful participation in class discussionsthorough evaluation of a museum Web siteand thoughtful reflection on the Web site’s overall success.

Extension Activities:

1. Explore e-Arcades.com (//www.e-arcades.com/))a site inspired by the late critic of artculture and historyWalter Benjamin. His Arcades Project attempted to capture an “associative” view of history using a montage of quotations. Why are Web links an appropriate tool for honoring Benjamin’s ideas? How does the site use quotes and links to suggest layers of meaning about technology? Investigate Walter Benjamin’s life and workand write a review of e-Arcades that explores the success of the Web site; submit your review to the site’s developer. In additionyou may wish to suggest a quote that you think would be appropriate to add to the site.

2. Visit a cultural institution (museumlibrary or historic site) in your area and develop a Web site to introduce kids to this institution. Diagram the site’s structure and navigationand propose a design for the site’s homepage. Present it to the institution for consideration.

3. Visit the Digital Gallery of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles (//www.moca.org/museum/digital_gallery.php). Chose one of the Internet-based works of art on display and write a review. In your viewis the Internet the best medium for this work of art? Why or why not?

Interdisciplinary Connections:

Economics- How do museums support themselves? What income do they bring in that allows them to collectpreserveand present works to the public? What fundraising ventures are available to them and what financial constraints are placed upon them? Interview a representative from a museum to learn about its financial health. Based on what you have learnedare you more likely to become a member or encourage others to join? Why or why not?

Journalism- Poll members of your community about their usage of the Internet. Then write an article about the most (and least) popular uses of the Internet. Submit this article to your local paper.

Media Studies- Watch a movie about a “misunderstood” artistsuch as “Basquiat” (1996)“Pollack” (2000)or “Frida” (2002). Then write a review of the movie. How was this artist viewed in his or her time? Does the movie help you understand this artist’s work better? Why or why not? What risks did these artists take in their lives? Do you feel the insights and observations of these artists provided a valuable commentary about art and societyor were his or her ideas and behaviors frivolous and irresponsible? Explain why.

 586,  2015, a, Las mujeres somos volubles. Debido a nuestro diseño evolutivoestamos hechas para ser sensibles a nuestro entornotener empatía con las necesidades de nuestros hijos e intuir las intenciones de nuestras parejas. Esto es esencial para nuestra supervivencia y la de nuestros descendientes. Algunas investigaciones sugieren que las mujeres tienen mayor capacidad para articular sentimientos que los hombres porque a medida que el cerebro femenino se desarrollase reserva más capacidad para el lenguajela memoriala audición y la observación de emociones de los demás.

Estas observaciones se basan en la biologíay no intentan aludir a ningún tipo de ideología pro- o antifeministapero sí tienen consecuencias sociales. La emotividad de las mujeres es un signo de saludno de enfermedad; es una fuente de poder. Estamos sometidas a una presión constante por contener nuestras vidas emocionales; nos han enseñado a disculparnos por nuestras lágrimasa suprimir nuestro enojo y a temer que nos llamen histéricas.

La industria farmacéutica usa ese miedo y se dirige a las mujeres mediante un torrente de publicidad en los programas de entrevistas matutinos y en las revistas. El número de estadounidenses que toma medicamentos nunca había sido tan alto y en mi experiencia los siguen tomando por mucho más tiempo del requerido. La venta de antidepresivos y ansiolíticos se ha disparado durante las últimas dos décadas y en épocas recientes han sido superadas por un antipsicóticoAbilifyque ocupa el primer lugar de ventas de entre todos los medicamentos que se comercializan en Estados Unidosno sólo los psiquiátricos.

Como psiquiatra con veinte años de experienciadebo decir que esto es una locura.

Al menos una de cada cuatro mujeres en Estados Unidos toma un medicamento psiquiátrico hoy en díaen comparación con uno de cada siete hombres; y las mujeres son dos veces más proclives a que se les diagnostique depresión o trastorno de ansiedad que los hombres. Estos medicamentos han mejorado considerablemente la vida de muchas mujerespero hay otras que no los necesitan. La mayor prescripción de medicamentos psiquiátricosque a menudo recetan médicos de otras especialidadesestá creando una nueva normaque alienta a más mujeres a recurrir al uso de químicos. La decisión de si una mujer necesita tomar estos medicamentos debería ser médicano una respuesta a la presión de grupo o al consumismo.

La nueva norma de prescripción médica contradice la biología dinámica de las mujerescuya química cerebral y corporal está hecha para cambiar constantemente. Para explicarlo de manera simplepensemos en la serotonina como el químico cerebral que nos dice que “todo está bien”; si hay demasiada serotoninanada nos importapero si los niveles de serotonina son muy bajos todo se vuelve un problema que es necesario resolver.

En los días previos a la menstruacióncuando incrementa la sensibilidad emocionallas mujeres pueden sentirse más expuestasirritables o insatisfechas. Yo les digo a mis pacientes que los pensamientos y sentimientos que perciben durante esta fase son genuinos y que tal vez es mejor reevaluar aquello con lo que tienen que lidiar en el resto del mescuando es más probable que sus niveles hormonales y de neurotransmisores estén programados para motivarlas a que se adapten a las demandas y necesidades de los demás.

Los antidepresivos más comunesque también se usan como ansiolíticosson los inhibidores selectivos de la recaptación de serotonina (I.S.R.S.)que mejoran la transmisión de serotonina. Estos inhibidores hacen que las cosas “estén bien”pero no está bien ver todo bien. Un mayor nivel de serotonina puede hacer que una sea más tolerante y aquiete sus miedospero también ayuda a que se vuelva insensiblefísica y emocionalmente. Estos medicamentos a menudo hacen que las mujeres estén menos interesadas en el sexo. Los I.S.R.S. tienden más a suprimir los pensamientos negativos que a alentar los positivos. Si una está tomando un inhibidor selectivo de la recaptación de serotoninatal vez no ande por ahí brincando de alegríapero sí sentirá que es más racional y menos emocional. Algunas personas que utilizan estos medicamentos han dicho percibir menos otros rasgos humanos como la empatíala molestiala tristezalos sueños eróticosla creatividadel enojola capacidad de expresar los sentimientosel duelo y la preocupación.

Por supuesto que hay situaciones en las que es necesario el uso de medicamentos psiquiátricos. El problema es quemientras que hay demasiadas personas realmente enfermas que no están en tratamiento principalmente debido a factores socioeconómicoslas personas que no necesitan estos medicamentos están tratando de suprimir una reacción normal a un conjunto de factores estresantes que no es natural: vidas sin suficientes horas de descansosolnutrientesmovimiento y contacto visualque son elementales para los primates sociales como nosotros.

Si los niveles de serotonina de las mujeres se incrementan continuamente de manera artificialéstas corren el riesgo de perder sensibilidad emocional con sus fluctuaciones naturalesal adoptar un equilibrio hormonal más masculino y estático. Esta insensibilización emocional alienta a las mujeres a asumir comportamientos que los hombres comúnmente aprueban: una apariencia invulnerablepor ejemploes una actitud que podría ayudar a las mujeres a escalar en negocios dominados por los hombres. Los estudios en primates muestran que los I.S.R.S. pueden aumentar comportamientos de dominio social y elevar el nivel de jerarquía de un animal.

¿Pero a qué costo? Tuve una paciente que me llamó desde su oficina llorando para decirme que necesitaba aumentar su dosis de antidepresivos porque no podía permitir que la vieran llorando en el trabajo. Al descubrir el motivo de su molestia – su jefe la había humillado frente a sus subalternos – decidimos que lo que necesitaba era enfrentar a su jefe en una discusión calmadaen lugar de más medicamentos.

Una revisión de los historiales médicos muestrade manera constanteque los doctores tienden a recetar medicamentos psiquiátricos a las mujeres más que a los hombresen especial a las mujeres de 35 a 64 años. Para algunas mujeres de esas edadeslos síntomas de la perimenopausia pueden ser muy parecidos a la depresión y es común sentir ganas de llorar. No sólo se llora de tristeza. Cuando estamos asustados o nos sentimos frustrados al presenciar una injusticiacuando nos conmueve profundamente la aflicción humanalloramos. Y algunas mujeres lloran más fácilmente que otrasaunque eso no quiere decir que seamos débiles o que estemos fuera de control. Cuando se consumen dosis elevadas de I.S.R.S. se dificulta llorar; este medicamento incluso puede aumentar la apatía y la indiferencia. El cambio surge del descontento y la apreciación de que algo está mal; sabemos que algo está bien únicamente porque lo sentimos. Por lo tantosi estar medicado significa ser complacienteno sirve.

Cuando una persona está consumiendo una mayor dosis de la necesariasus emociones se vuelven sintéticas. Si lo que buscamos es crecimiento personalun matrimonio más satisfactorio y un mundo mucho más pacíficolo que necesitamos es más empatíacompasiónreceptividademotividad y vulnerabilidadno menos.

Necesitamos dejar de etiquetar nuestra tristeza y ansiedad como síntomas incómodos y valorarlos como una parte saludable y flexible de nuestra biología.

 2380,  2005, a, The photographer Lane Stewart needed someone to pose for all the pictures: Sidd talking with the Mets' pitching coachMel Stottlemyre; Sidd pitching (as always) in one work boot and one bare foot; Sidd carrying his ever-present French horn. Stewart immediately cast his pal Bertonwho when not teaching art at a suburban Chicago middle school occasionally assisted him on local shootsand who bore an eerie resemblance to Plimpton's imagined Finch: tallshyly awkwardwith feet and ears a few sizes too big.

Stewart recalled the conversation with Berton:

"Joethe Mets have this pitcher down in Florida I have to go shoot," Stewart said. "He plays the French hornhis only possessions are a rug and food bowland he pitches in one work boot. And he's got this 168-mile-an-hour fastball. Can you come with me?"

"Great!" Berton said.

"There's only one catch -- you're going to be him."

"Huh?"

Selected Mets officials were among the few people (including Sports Illustrated editors) even slightly aware of what the magazine was up to. They issued Berton a uniform and allowed him full access to their spring training complexeven letting him sit in the bullpen during exhibition games as Stewart clicked away. Fans would ask the weird-looking guy in the No. 21 jersey if he was trying out for the cluband he would reply: "Yeah. You'll hear about it later."

Did they ever. When Sports Illustrated hit the newsstands several days before the April 1 cover date"The Curious Case of Sidd Finch" staggered baseball and beyond. Two major league general managers called the new commissionerPeter Ueberrothto ask how Finch's opponents could even stand at the plate safely against a fastball like that. The sports editor of one New York newspaper berated the Mets' public relations manJay Horwitzfor giving Sports Illustrated the scoop. The St. Petersburg Times sent a reporter to find Finchand a radio talk-show host proclaimed he had actually spotted the phenom -- whotruth be toldwas back in Oak Park teaching art at Hawthorne Junior High.

Alasthe enchanting details of Plimpton's story were also its downfall. Harvard and Tibet and the French horn and the 168-m.p.h. heater -- people were gradually brought back to earth by more skeptical acquaintances. (For his partPlimpton always loved how the seventh definition of "finch" in his Oxford English Dictionary was "small lie.") As word spread over several days that the first letters of the article's secondary headline read"Happy April Fools'," the jig was up.

Berton became a star. Television crews from across the nation went to his home and school to interview himto have him wear the boot and throw. He became Sidd Finch to thousands of fans and was recognized wherever he went. Even in England a few months latera man almost spilled his drink at the sight of him in an Oxford pub.

"You're Sidd Finch!" he said. "You're in Oxford!"

Soon after the hoax was revealedthe Mets decided to stage Sidd Finch Retirement Day. Berton told an oddly dejected crowd"The perfect pitchonce a thing of harmonyis now an instrument of chaos and cruelty." He received a standing ovation as he walked down the foul line for the last time.

 5160,  1989, a, Come down the hillgo north from Winchcombe for a couple of milesand you jump over 3,000 years in time. Hailes Abbey was a Cistercian foundationone of Henry VIII's victims during the dissolution of the monasteries. Today it is an elegant ruinits golden cloisters glowing against a dark backdrop of trees. It has the melancholy and perfection of many ruinsmaking you feel that it can never have been other than it is nowwith a few visitors wandering around the archways trying to puzzle out the arrangement of the abbey churchthe refectory and wood pigeons moaning in the chestnuts. It is only when you go into the little museum that you begin to glimpse the realities of that vanished monastic empire - in which a great monastery presided over an areaextracting wealth from far and wideits flocks of sheep munching the grasslandsthe monks acting both as employers and exploiters. Andof coursethe monastery was the center of culture; in the museumfragments of medieval tilesornate and delicateand the great sculptural bosses from the roof of the abbey give a potent taste of the splendors of the place at the height of its prosperity.

Just across the road is the little parish churchwith some of the most evocative medieval wall paintings I knoweven in an area rich with these reminders that once all churches were blazoned with pattern and story. At Hailes there are two sto-ries - on one wall is St. Christopherpatron saint of (Continued on Page 94) travelershere a shadowy figure with a staff making his way across a river; opposite is a rare secular painting of a hare crouching under a treeears laid back in fearfacing two panting greyhounds. Elsewhere are patchy fragments of fleurs-de-lis and in one corner is a grotesque owl creature straight out of Hieronymus Bosch.

I can rememberas a schoolgirltrailing around in the wake of my grandmother and my auntknowledgeable church buffswhile they reveled in clerestories and misericords. All I wanted to do was get home for tea. I can't remember now when I saw the light and learned to savor the pleasures of church-crawling for myself - but there is no better place in which to do it than this hinge of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire. Arm yourself with the appropriate volume of Nikolaus Pevsner's ''Buildings of England,'' or one of the several competent guides to parish churchesand you will soon become immersed in distinguishing Perpendicular from Decoratedsearching for medieval brasses and arrestingly phrased wall memorialswandering through cow parsley and meadowsweet in the churchyard to read the gravestones. An afternoon of this is infinitely more satisfying than the routine visit to some scheduled place of interest - you feel a proper sense of discoverya pride of possession.

That being saidthere are a couple of well-visited places that should not be missed. Sudeley Castlejust outside Winchcombeis a Tudor pile once fallen into ruin and replenished in the 19th century by an indomitable wealthy collector called Mrs. Enna Dentwho pieced the place together again and furnished it with an eclectic lot of stuffmuch of which is there nowincluding some fine paintings - a Turner and a Constablea Van Dyck and a Jan Steen. Outsidethere are yowling peacockshedges of yew and box clipped to within an inch of their lives and manicured gravel paths. All a bit too neat and tidyto my eyebut the arthritic old oaks in the parkland are a compensation. IndeedSudeley is perhaps a good example of what goes right and wrong with the professional stately home trying to keep its end up in the marketplace of tourism today. Display and information are well donebut the spit and polish is carried too far and somehow drains the place of much feeling of reality. Andof coursethere is the ubiquitous shop. Plus a craft center - another essential ingredient these daysit seems - in which decently crafted goods are distressingly mixed up with some dreadful kitsch. S NOWS HILL MANORA few miles away in the village of Snowshillis more to my taste. The house itself is a traditional Cots-wold manor house - sprawlingarchitecturally incoherentstiff with beams and mullioned windows and paneling and unexpected little rooms and staircases. The gardens are a delight - sunny walled terraces leading one from anothersweeps of lawn and great brooding trees. But the function of the place today is as a shrine to British eccentricity. We are rather good at eccentricsand Charles Wadewho owned Snowshill from 1919 till his death in 1956was a champion among them. He was a collector. Not one of your deliberateorganizedfastidious collectorsbut a wonderful crazy jackdaw collector - accumulating everything and anything from lace bobbin winders and Bath chairs to suits of Japanese samurai armor.

There it all isthis glorious jumble of acquisitioncrammed into the many rooms of the manorwithout much attempt at rhyme or reason; andindeedyou would be hard put to impose order on an accumulation that has little or no binding theme other than a vague predilection for the Oriental.

Charles Wade's taste in furniture was simple: if it is veneeredgilt-encrustedhas drawersminiature porticoespillars with ornate capitalsinlay of any kind - buy it. Furniture as architecture - ''Chinese cabinet of black and gold lacquer in the form of a Buddhist shrine; large cabinet with brass inlay and semiprecious stones; Spanish Vargueno cabinet . . . ,'' the guidebook gives up in despair. And there are the 15 spinning wheels and the 28 leather fire buckets and the dozens of enormous keys displayed in a glass case and the Admiral Room with its ships and globes and instruments of navigation. There is also a room with nothing but old musical instrumentsfrom hurdy-gurdies to an 18th-century cello and an ophicleide and three citterns.

From time to time Charles Wade seems to have run amok completely - 11 German Black Forest clocksfor heaven's sakeand what must be the prototype of a baby bouncer (heavily worn) and the most ancient baby strollers I've ever seen. Up in the attic is a cavalcade of antique bicycleswith a hefty penny-farthing triumphantly presiding. There are models of haywagonsa couple of feet long with shaftand each of them differentcrafted replicas of the various kinds used in English counties -WiltshireHampshireOxfordshireSussex . . .
 4039,  1996, a, A dozen Yankees surrounded a small television in a corner of the visitor's clubhouse at Anaheim Stadium this afternoonwatching the Baltimore Orioles play the Seattle Mariners. They shouted encouragement like typical fanscriticized players and plays like typical fans andunlike typical Yankees fansactually seemed relaxed.

Five hours later the Yankees were even more relaxedbecause Jimmy Key rebounded from being smashed in the left elbow with a line drive five days ago to twirl eight tidy inningsCharlie Hayes made a smashing season debut with two hits and three runs batted in and every starter rapped at least one hit as New York coasted to a 14-3 victory over the California Angels.

Will the real Yankees please stand up?

For the first time on this West Coast road tripthe Yankees looked intimidating. They did it by scoring seven runs in the third inning off Jason Dicksona 23-year-old rookie who beat them on Aug. 20and never stopping. The struggling Cecil Fielder rested and New York did not hit a homerbut baseballs soared into orbit all night anyway: The Yankees roped eight singlesseven doubles and a triple.

Key (10-10)who won for the first time in five startspermitted only home runs by George Arias and Chili Davis to sail into orbit as he also looked intimidating in his artistic way. The Yankees were worried when Seattle's Alex Rodriguez drilled a liner off Key's elbow last Monday and he was forced to leave that game in the firstbut he eased those concerns in limiting California to five hits. Key was not fazed by the liner as he speared six grounders tonight. Dale Polley loaded the bases in the ninthbut got Orlando Palmeiro to pop up to close out the victory.

''I have very special access,'' she said. Nearly every day at 6 A.M.the Mayor picks her up for a 40-minute workout on a treadmills in a downtown gym. He dines at her apartment almost weekly. She is an unsalaried member of mayoral commissions on the Status of Women and on the Year 2000. She is a sounding board and a source whose complaint about pickpocketing led to creation of a special police squad that arrested more than two dozen suspects on the Madison Avenue bus. Her tip about tony stores that help customers avoid sales taxesa scam confided to her by a friendhas already raised more than $12 million in penalties and back taxes for the city.

''I'm a concerned citizen,'' she said''andboydo I get action.''

The Mayor is her mentor. He is also her brother.

Donald Trumpto borrow his own wordis unbelievable.

At around 2:30 on Monday afternoonat a rally in Cedar RapidsIowaDonald Trump was loudlyconfidently and repeatedly proclaiming his impending victory in Iowa. Just before 10 p.m.he was acting like he had never expected to winand like coming in second was a YUGE accomplishment.

“I absolutely love the people of Iowa,” Mr. Trump said at his campaign headquarters. “Unbelievable.”

Mr. Trump said that when he declared his candidacy in June“I was told by everybodydo not go to Iowayou could never finish even in the top 10.”

“I said I have to do it,” he said. “And we finished second and I want to tell you somethingI’m just honored.”

Mr. Trump congratulated the victorTed Cruzfor winning and Mike Huckabee for quitting and never mentioned Marco Rubiowho was coming in a very close third on Monday night and should be a focus of Mr. Trump’s attention.

It’s impossible to know whether Mr. Trump understands that his slack campaign organization in Iowa may have cost him dearly here. Kenneth P. Vogel of Politico said Mr. Trump spent almost as much on hats as he did on payroll.

Ever optimisticMr. Trump said he was on to New Hampshirewhere he — of course — promised a big victory.

The womenwho were convicted of “sexual relations between women,” were each struck six times with a rattan cane in front of witnesses in the Shariah High Court in the state of Terengganuofficials said.

The sentencedelivered four months after an election that saw Malaysia’s governing party ousted for the first time since the country was founded in 1957reflects the country’s deeply conservative culture despite a liberalization in its politics.

Rights groups assailed the new government for discrimination against gay men and lesbians and for continuing to allow a form of corporal punishment outlawed in most of the world.

An Appraisal: A Character Actor of Intensified Normalness
 4347,  1994, a, Aaron Glenn makes sure the ball is hidden from the veterans.

Even Saturdayan off day at the Jets' summer campGlenn told his fellow rookie Ryan Yarborough to hide it.

"It's in his car," disclosed Glenn. "In a safe place."

The ball is symbolictrue. But it is also very important to Coach Pete Carrollwho has entrusted Glennhis top draft pickwith watching over it.

Carroll is the rookie head coachand he has adopted this philosophy as he oversees offensedefense and special teams: the ball.

"We want to control it," he said. "We want to keep it on offenseand turn it over on defense."

His role as head coachfor nowis to be around the ball on the practice field. He is not coaching players on where they stand or how they move. But every player understands what Carroll is doing.

 2058,  2007, a, Two columns in the June 30 issue of Wine Spectator provide a fascinating counterpoint in one of the most important aesthetic arguments in wine today. The firstby James Laubeone of the Spectator’s senior editorstakes a swipe at those who complain about the high alcohol content in many of today’s wines. “If you taste a wine and it seems to be balanced,’’ Laube writes“the alcohol content shouldn’t matter.’’

That’s the standard retort from the high-alcohol apologistsand it’s not really what makes the column interestingthough it lets you know where Laube stands. Nowhat makes the column worth reading is his point that high alcohol levels are a necessary tradeoff for “plush wines with loads of flavorbodytexture and depth.’’

“For many of us more alcohol is an acceptable price for richflavorfulfront-loaded wines that are engagingly complex and ready to drink the day you buy them,’’ he writes. He does allow that he would prefer wines in the 13.5 percent rangeas in Bordeauxrather than at the 15 to 17 percent level that many California wines are currently hitting. “Howeverin many other parts of the worldincluding Californiamany wines made at more moderate alcohol levels don’t have much flavorand reds are often too tannic,’’ he says.

NowI have to take issue with that last statement. My problem with many of the higher-alcohol winesparticularly those from Californiais that they are overbearing. Too much flavor. Too jammy. Too sweet-tasting. Too powerful. Too plush. They taste the same and they don’t go with food. If you are used to eating steaks slathered with ketchupmayonnaise and all manner of secret saucean unadorned steak may seem devoid of flavor – until you get used to eating that way again and your taste buds recover their appreciation for subtlety and nuance. To put it another waya marching band will always outblast a piano trioand if you are accustomed only to marching bandsyou may not appreciate the trio.

Let’s be clear: Few people find high alcohol desirable in a wine. Some people find it a serious flaw. Otherslike James Laubetolerate it because they enjoy the bigrich style of these wines. But to suggest that it’s necessary in California rather than a stylistic decision on the part of the winemaker is plain wrong. Laube as much as says so himself. “We’re living through a phaseone of those periods where it’s fashionable to make the most expressive wine possibleand that will change,’’ he writes“expressive’’ being a euphemism for big.

On that last pointI happen to agree with him. In the last five years or sothe pendulum has swung for California chardonnays. Of coursethe tropical fruitoak and buttered popcorn wines that were the defining style of the 1990’s are still widely availablebut many winemakers have come back to leanerless extravagantmore Chablis-like chardonnays. They have backed away from power and toward finesse. I think 10 years from now we’ll see the same thing happening with red wines.

By the waywhile I don’t care for many high-alcohol winesI don’t reject all of them. Many Châteauneuf-du-Papes exceed 15 percentand some of them are great. I’ve enjoyed some big California pinot noirs and zinfandels. And last year I wrote about Diatoma chardonnay from the Santa Rita Hills that was captivating despite its 16.2 percent alcohol. But on the whole I think balanced high-alcohol wines are fairly rare.

A colleague of James Laube’sMatt Kramerhas certainly spoken up for finesse in the pastand in his column in this edition of the Spectatorhe asks the rhetorical question“Has pinot noir become boring?’’

Kramerwho is always one of the most thought-provoking wine writersexamines the uniformity of many New World pinot noirsand points at the narrow selections of clones planted in many new pinot noir vineyards. NowI know discussion of clonal selections is a guaranteed turnoff for many wine loversbut I’ll ask your forbearance because I think Kramer’s point is important. The various versions of the popular Dijon clones all emphasize certain red and black fruit flavorswhich produce a powerful sameness rather than the complexity that might result from mixing together other clones of pinot noir.

I’ve had the opportunity to taste wines made of different clones of pinot noirgrown in the same vineyardand the differences can be astonishing. I remember one tasting session at the Hirsch Vineyards on the Sonoma Coast. David Hirsch poured wine made from a Pommard clonewhich had great acidity and vibrant fruit as well as a slight herbaceousness and an elegance. Then a wine from the Mount Eden clonewhich had a distinct raspberry flavorand a different Mount Eden clonewhich had a brightbrilliant cherry flavor. Then a Swan selectionwhich was drystructured and powerful with complex fruit and herbal flavors. Dijon clones seemed powerfultoobut with less dimension. The best wine of all was made from the various clones blended together.

Kramer also addresses the important question of ripenesswhich he calls “the single most important aesthetic decision today.’’

“Just when a grape is deemed ‘ripe’ has changed dramatically in the past decade,’’ he writes. “This has resulted not only in more alcoholically powerful wines but in more uniform-tasting onestoo. When a grape gets overripe it loses its more subtle flavor shadings.’’

Exactly what I’ve been sayingthank you. What’s especially disturbing is that pinot noir excels at making thrillingly subtle wines of great nuance. Insteadwe’re getting what Laube approvingly describes as “darkopulent New World cabernet or pinot noir brimming with broadrich flavors and smooth fleshy tannins.’’

Jeezdo we really want to lump cabernet and pinot noir together like that? My guess is Kramer would say absolutely not.

I have to compliment the Spectator for publishing Laube and Kramer practically on adjoining pages in the magazine. Both men are far too gentlemanly to take a swipe at one another but if you close your eyes you can almost feel them throwing elbows back and forth.
 1530,  2010, a, The former head of the American International Group unit that nearly crippled the insurer said the 2008 taxpayer bailout of up to $182 billion was too generous to customers like Goldman SachsReuters reports.

Goldman Sachsin turninsisted it simply followed its agreement with A.I.G. and underlying accounting rules in demanding collateral under the credit default insurance products it bought from A.I.G.

“I think I would have negotiated a much better deal for the taxpayer than what the taxpayer got,” a defiant yet calm Joseph Cassano told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission on Wednesday.

Mr. Cassanothe ex-chief of A.I.G.’s Financial Products Division who was edged out roughly seven months before the September 2008 bailoutsays he could have saved taxpayers money if he had been allowed to negotiate claims with firms like Goldman.

Insteadflush with cash after the bailoutA.I.G. moved to settle claims at full value.

Goldman’s presidentGary Cohnoffered no apology for the collateral calls and said considerable shareholder money was spent ahead of the bailout to insure against the risk that A.I.G. would never pay.

“If you look at our trading agreement with A.I.G.it very clearly states our marks were to be determined at fair (market) value,” Mr. Cohn said.

The commission is holding two days of hearings into the role of derivatives in the financial crisis. Thursday’s session will include further A.I.G. and Goldman witnesses along with current and former regulators.

Wednesday’s hearing provided Mr. Cassanoagainst whom federal inquiries were recently droppedwith an opportunity to defend himself publicly. It also allowed Goldman a forum to again reject criticism that it bet against clients and received a backdoor bailout as part of the government’s rescue of A.I.G.

The 10-member commissionheaded by the former California state treasurerPhil Angelidesis scheduled to issue a report by Dec. 15 detailing the causes of financial crisis.

“I’m not looking for a whodunnitbut who built this bomb?” Mr. Angelides asked during Wednesday’s hearing.

 4774,  1991, a, Merchandise creditors of Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores reacted with general approval yesterday to the companies' reorganization plan because they would get the biggest share -- about $513 million -- of the $850 million in cash to be offered.

But they said that many problems in the planwhich was filed on Mondaymust be resolved before they could give formal consent. A Federal judge cannot allow Federated and Allied to emerge from voluntary bankruptcy until at least 50 percent of each class of creditorrepresenting at least two-thirds of the class's debthas approved the plan.

Federated and Allied filed for bankruptcy in January 1990. The Campeau Corporation acquired Federated in 1988 and Allied in 1986. The debt taken on in connection with the two acquisitions forced Federated and Allied into bankruptcy. The Remaining $337 Million

The remaining $337 million in cash would be distributed to other unsecured creditorsas well as to secured creditorsincluding banks and some premerger bondholdersalong with notes and stock. Other bondholdershoweverwould be offered only stock in a new companyFederated Department Storeswhich would emerge early next year as a combination of Federated and Allied's 244 department stores.
 2256,  2006, a, Hopes at NASA for good weather were high throughout the morningwhich dawned bright and relatively clear. Dozens of government officialsincluding Vice President Dick Cheneycame to the space center for the launching.

All morningthe issue causing more concern than the weather was a heater for one of the shuttle's six small thrusters that was not operating properly. But mission officials decided to work around that problem and launch anywaysince shuttle pilots are trained to work without all six thrusters.

Storms are another matterhoweverand NASA does not launch when anvil-shaped clouds are near because of the potential for lightning.

A single anvil cloud began to dissipate before 3 p.m.but others began massing behind it. At 3:15half an hour before the scheduled liftoff at 3:49Bruce Buckinghama NASA spokesmanannounced"We are still no go for weather."

The clouds near the launching site began to dissipatebut clouds massed over the landing strip — another condition that prohibits liftoff because good visibility there is needed in case the flight is aborted soon after liftoff and the shuttle has to be brought back to the Kennedy landing site. Two minutes before the countdown was to resumeMichael Leinbachthe launching directordecided to delay resuming it to see if the weather would clear before the day's window closed. Though the seven astronauts had been strapped into their seats in the shuttlewith the hatch shut at 2 p.m.the mission managers gave the order to cancel liftoff at 3:42.

Mr. Leinbach apologized to the commanderCol. Steven W. Lindsey of the Air Force. "Sorry to break your string," he said"but we're not going to launch today." Mr. Leinbach added"We're going to try again tomorrow."

Colonel Lindsey agreed. "We'll launch when we're ready," he said. "Hopefullytomorrow will look better."

In a brief interview on NASA televisionMr. Leinbach said"We played it till the end," but ran out of time.

"We can't control the weatherand we have very strict rules," he said. "It was very disappointing for the entire launch team."

But he added"We're not going to launch the vehicle unless it's safe."

NormallyNASA waits a day after two unsuccessful launching attempts to give the astronautsground crew and mission controllers the rest that allows them to remain sharp; two more consecutive days of launch attempts would follow. If the shuttle cannot be launched before July 19the next window opens in August.

Mr. Cheneywho was at Cape Canaveral with his wife and three granddaughterssaid he was disappointedaccording to Reuters.

"I was really looking forward to todayespecially looking forward to having my grandkids here," he said. "But it was not to be today. Maybe it will work tomorrow."

 2404,  2005, a, IT'S not surprising that "Riding the Bus With My Sister," the 2003 autobiographical book by Rachel Simon that inspired tonight's Hallmark Hall of Fame presentationis set in a city that is never named. If word got out about the town's terrific bus driversthe regulars would be standing in the aisles. And Ms. Simon's sisterBeththe most fanatic of regularswould be among them. In her bookMs. Simon describes Beth (near rightwith Ms. Simon) as "a person with mental retardation." She now prefers "with a developmental or cognitive disability," she saidalthough Beth likes "a person with special needs" -- one of them being the freedom to bus-hop around her city for most of the day. Like the bookthe filmshown at 9 on CBSis about the year Ms. Simon decided to enter her sister's world on wheelsbut includes flashbacks to their childhood. During her time en routeMs. Simon discovered the kindness of strangers (there are 12 bus drivers in her bookreduced to two composites in the movie)as well as the special abilities of the sister she had worried too much about for 38 years. "I've inadvertently become a national speaker for both the disability community and the public transit industryand I meet bus drivers all around the country," she said. "They're a type of person that is well represented by the people in the movie -- very giving peoplesensitive peoplepeople people." It was at the house of one of Beth's bus-driving buddies that Ms. Simon and her sister first watched the filmwhich stars Andie MacDowell as a dewy-eyed Rachel and Rosie O'Donnell as a bouncybeat-you-to-the-bus-door Beth. "What Rosie got," Ms. Simon said"was exactly what she wanted to get: a character who is being portrayed not as a stereotype but as a full person -- someone who isn't going to be pushed around." Not even to the film's Los Angeles premiere. "Ohyeahshe knows what she wants," Ms. Simon said of the real Beth. "She doesn't want to be on an airplane. And what's the fun of sitting in a movie theater with movie stars if you can sit on a bus with your favorite driver?" JODY ALESANDRO

Age 59

Occupation Founder and creative consultantJ. Lindeberg; photographer

Location WilliamsburgBrooklyn

Favorite Room The living room of his rental housewhich has green-gray walls and a Vladimir Kagan sofa where the Swedish-born clothing designerwho recently returned to his namesake brandJ. Lindebergdoes his best work. “I don’t like to sit behind a desk — it blocks my mind and my creativity,” Mr. Lindeberg said. “For mea sofa is the center point.”

This roomwith its dark walls and collection of skull masksfeels very masculine. Do you live alone? I think it feels French chic. But I separated from my partner a year and a half ago. I’d been living in SoHo for many years. I was kind of tired of traffic and people. I changed my environmentmoved to Williamsburg. It’s a very calm street. I always like dark walls. It makes it somehow tighter and homier.

You’re known as a partygoer and a night owl. How much time do you actually spend at home? I actually changed in the last year. I used to be out a lot in New York. Since I moved here after a separationI decided to spend a lot of time at home and think and ground myself and find inspiration on a new level. So the house has been very important to me the last year and a half.
 4143,  1995, a, In an interviewMr. Chafeewho helped expand Medicaid to reach millions of children and women in the 1980'ssaid: "I don't want to get into a situation where we're reducing the number of people covered. That could happen if Medicaid is no longer an entitlement."

Medicaid pays for one out of every three births in the United Statesfinances care for more than a fourth of the country's children and pays for 2 out of every 3 people in nursing homes on any given day. It is much more complex than the main cash assistance programAid to Families With Dependent Childrenand costs about six times as much.

In the last 10 yearsFederal spending on Medicaid quadrupledto $82 billion in 1994and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost will rise an average of more than 10 percent a year in the next five yearsreaching $148 billion in 2000. Medicaid has become a huge financial burden for the stateswhich must put up their own money to get Federal Medicaid money. On averagethe states contribute 75 cents for each Federal dollarbut those with high per-capita incomeslike New YorkNew Jersey and Connecticutmust match the Federal contribution dollar for dollar.

Representative John R. Kasichthe Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committeeand Senator Domenici said they had told the governors that they intended to cut Medicaid's current growth rate by half. If the Federal Government held the growth to 5 percent in each of the next five yearsit would spend $97 billion less than it expects to spend under current law.

How could such savings be achieved? Governors and Congressional leaders say more Medicaid recipients must be enrolled in health maintenance organizations and other forms of managed care. They assume that the Federal Government will reduce or eliminate special payments to hospitals serving disproportionate numbers of indigent patients. But ultimatelythey saystates may have to impose new restrictions on eligibility or cut coverage of some services.

James D. Bentleysenior vice president of the American Hospital Associationsaid he feared that in negotiating with Congress on block grantseach state would "pursue its narrow self-interestsaying 'me first' " as it tried to maximize its share of Federal Medicaid money.

Seven states have received permission from the Federal Government for statewide experiments to control Medicaid costs or expand eligibilityand 10 other statesincluding New Yorkhave applied for such waivers. But the state experiments are modest by comparison with the block grants being devised in Congress. None of the state programs eliminate the individual entitlement to Medicaidthe bedrock upon which the program has been built for 30 years.

 2916,  2002, a, WHEN Stephen Sondheim extolled the virtues of ''the little things you do together'' in the musical ''Company,'' eating candy was nowhere on the list. Now Marsthe confectionery giant that makes Milky Wayis revamping the brand's advertising in most markets around the world to promote the candy bar as one of life's small delights.

In a campaign that begins today in the United States and in May in Britain and Europeoffices of Grey Worldwidethe brand's new agencyare asserting that it provides ''Pleasure you can't measure.''

The American part of the campaign features television commercials comparing Milky Way to momentary thrills that deliver frissons of good feelings. Among them: reaching that itchy spot with a back scratcherbreaking the bubbles in shrink wrap with a satisfying popping soundmaking a friend's hair stand on end with a balloon and watching a car odometer turn over from 99,999 miles.

Those pleasures are perhaps minuscule to the point of invisibility. But when consumers have long since learned to ignore or even mock the hyperbole of advertisingoffering a scaled-downeasily delivered benefit may be no small feat. That is particularly true when seeking to stimulate sales for venerable brands like Milky Waybecause breathlessly Bunyanesque claims are less likely to be believable with familiar products.

 4579,  1992, a, He began taking money from the campaign in Augustafter Suzanne DuBosethe executive director who co-signed all checks for more than $2,000resignedcampaign aides say. Her replacementRobin Belldid not want responsibility for writing checks. Harold Ickescounsel to the campaign committeeexplained that Mr. Biegen was "the logical choice" to take on that task.

Even though Mr. Biegen was not supervisedthere was little chance such money transfers could go undiscovered for long -- campaign contributions and expenditures had to be disclosed to the Campaign Finance Board by Jan. 15.

"Obviouslyit was an act of desperation," said Basil A. Patersona labor lawyer and former deputy mayor under Edward I. Koch. Mr. Paterson is an adviser to Mr. Dinkins and a longtime friend of Mr. Biegen's. "It made me think of the Maxwell deal," he saidreferring to the financial shell games of the British publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell. "Anyone looking at the books would see money had been transferred right away." Fast Friends

Mr. Paterson described Mr. Biegen as "very warmvery engagingnot somebody you only do business with -- you quickly get friendly." After Mr. Biegen became chairman of Mr. Dinkins's 1985 campaign for Manhattan borough presidentthe two men became fast friends -- spending weekends together in Mr. Biegen's five-bedroom summer house in East HamptonL.I.and playing tennis. Mr. Dinkins attended the wedding of Mr. Biegen's eldest son in 1990.

Mr. Dinkins said yesterday that he could not recall exactly how he met Mr. Biegenbut he thought it was between 1983 and 1985. Mr. Dinkinswho asked Mr. Biegen to replace his campaign chairmanHoward Samuelsafter Mr. Samuels died in 1984explained that "Mr. Biegen had a good reputationand assisted Mario Cuomo in raising funds."

Governor Cuomo did not return phone calls yesterday. His son Andrew Cuomo and Lucille Falconea longtime friend and fund-raiserdid not return repeated phone calls. But other friends of the Governor said that Mr. Biegen met Mr. Cuomo in the mid-70'swhen the Governor was still a private citizen. In 1977when Mr. Cuomo ran for Mayor of New York CityMr. Biegen was a member of his finance committee. William J. Sterna former fund-raiser for Mr. Cuomosaid of Mr. Biegen: "He was a loyal guy -- he did his job. He wasn't a starbut he wasn't a cluckeither." Prestigious Positions

Mr. Biegen did not appear to lavish his own money on his influential friends. When he and his wife had dinner at Nanni Al Valletto in Manhattan with Mr. Cuomo in 1981 during his campaign for Governorit was the candidate who paid the $200 check. In his diaryMr. Cuomo complained that the evening was "funbut outrageously expensive."

Mr. Biegen lives in an apartment in largebrick building in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. His friends describe him as warmengaging and honest. Some people close to the Mayor paint a less flattering portraitbut only on condition that they not be identified. Several aides complained that Mr. Biegen did not contribute much money of his own or raise impressive sums from his friends. Campaign finance records show that in 1989he made no personal cash contributions to the Mayor.

Like the cafeteriaHebrew University itself is one of the few places where Israel's Jews and its Arabswho make up 20 percent of the country's population of six millionmix and freely debate their differences -- far more collegially than they dofor examplein Israel's fractious Parliament.

As the 2102 Olympics draw nearthe coverage of the Games seems to become more intense and interesting by the day. The 2012 London Olympics blog will regularly showcase notable articles on the Webfrom British newspapers to sport- and team-specific sites:

Brian Cazeneuve at Sports Illustrated focuses on nine storylines to keep up with before and during the Gamesincluding the question of how fast Usain Bolt will run in London.

The Guardian’s Olympics blog is a collection of engaging news and notesincluding its report that Nur Suryani Mohamed Taibi of Malaysia will compete in the air rifle — and will be eight months pregnant at the time (also noted: no British beer will be sold at the Games).

The Daily Mail catches up with the seven athletes it selected seven years ago to follow as they prepared for the London Games.

At USA VolleyballSinjin Smith looks at beach volleyball in London and beyond.

And the latest on what’s going on with the summer’s U.S. Olympic and Paralympic archery teams.

 3638,  1998, a, New York State's highest court today upheld an investigative panel's findings that Elizabeth Holtzmanthe former New York City Comptrollerhad violated the city's conflict-of-interest laws when she took a campaign loan from a bank trying to obtain city business.

In a unanimous decisionthe Court of Appeals also said that Ms. Holtzman not only used her office for personal gain but also thwarted the bank's efforts to obtain repayment of the $450,000 loan at a time when the bank was seeking a lucrative contract from the city.

The decision marked the final chapter in a case that had sullied the name of Ms. Holtzmanonce one of the city's most prominent political figureswho lost her race for the United States Senate in 1992 and lost the Comptroller's race a year later.

Hours after the decision was announcedMs. Holtzmanwho now practices law privatelyassembled a news conference in Manhattanwhere she apologized for her behavior and expressed regret for the incident. Thenas reporters looked onshe held up a copy of the loan documentgrabbed a cigarette lighter and set the document on fire before dropping it in a wastebasket.

 2485,  2005, a, Little more than an armaturereallyfor Max's stream of consciousness musingsthe plot of "The Sea" is deliberately slight. After his wife's deathMax returns to the seaside town where he spent his boyhood summers and reminisces about a family he came to know there in his 11th year. He remembers how he developed a fixation on the voluptuous Mrs. Graceand how he eventually transferred those emotions to her daughterChloe. His long-ago memories of the Graces are intercut with more recent memories of his wifeAnnaand her painful death from cancer.

Maxa would-be art historian who has lived off Anna's inherited fortuneseems to have spent his copious amounts of free time gazing at his own navel and thinking very big thoughts about very little. He makes remarks like"A thing that always struck me was the contrast between nest and eggI mean the contingency of the formerno matter how well or even beautifully it was fashionedand the latter's completednessits pristine fullness." He describes a thunderstorm as a "spectacular display of Valhallan petulance" and a youthful crush as a "storm of passion" that left "the frail wings" of his emotions "burned and blasted by love's relentless flame." When he asks his daughter about her teddy bearshe refers to them as "your lares familiars."

In factMax talks like someone with a thesaurus permanently implanted in his brain: his monologue is studded with words like "leporine," "strangury," "perpetuance," "finical," "flocculent," "anthropic," "Avrilaceous," "anaglypta" and "assegais." Perhaps Max's grandiose language is meant to signify some sort of psychic defense mechanism on his partbut it's uncannily similar to the language employed by characters in Mr. Banville's earlier books. And together with his almost comical self-absorptionit makes Max sound like an annoying Peter Handke character on a bad day.

Equally irritating is Max's penchant for describing and redescribing everyone in his life and everything he sees in minute physical detail that radiates a prissy disgust for the human body. He describes his daughter's "upper gumsglistening and whitely pink." He describes Mrs. Grace's "haunches quivering under the light stuff of her summer dresses." And he describes Chloe's teeth as possessing a "delicate damp grey-green" tinge "like the damp light under trees after rain." Of his own appearancehe observes: "This morning it was the state of my eyes that struck me most forciblythe whites all craquelured over with those tiny bright-red veins and the moist lower lids inflamed and hanging a little way loose of the eyeballs."

No doubt this obsessive focus on the physical is intended to suggest Max's difficulty in making emotional sense of his lifebut combined with his windyself-indulgent abstractionsit only serves to alienate the reader from his story. Though "The Sea" may deal with some of the gravest issues of life -- deathlossregret -- it remainsin the enda chillydessicated and pompously written book that stands in sharp contrast to the vibrancy of many of this year's other Booker nominees.

 5279,  1988, a, Mr. Kornegay and Mr. Middleton were also convicted of second-degree felony murder and second-degree burglary; Mr. King was acquitted of those charges.

About two hours earlierthe jurors told Justice John J. Leahy that they had reached a verdict on two of the defendants but could not reach a decision on the thirdbelieved to be Mr. King. A key prosecution witness had testified that Mr. King attended a planning session in a crack house in which he suggested one of two plans for murdering Mrs. Greene. But Justice Leahy directed the jury to continue to deliberate.

The two murder charges each carry a minimum sentence of 15 years to life and a maximum sentence of 25 years to life. The burglary charge is punishable by a sentence of 5 to 15 years. By lawthe sentences will run concurrently because they arise from the same crime. As the defendants rose separately to face the jurorswho stood with an American flag hanging on the wood-paneled wall behind themthe sounds of evening traffic drifted in through the open windows.

After the verdicts were readMr. Middletonwho faces a robbery charge in another incidentslumped into his seat and bent his head forward onto the back of his lawyer's chair. Mr. Kornegaywho is already serving 25 years to life on a previous murder convictionsat down and rested his face on his hands. And Mr. Kinga senior at a Manhattan trade school at the time of his arreststood with his head drooping at one point. Before his arrest in this casehe had no criminal record.

Key evidence in the case was a videotaped confession by Mr. Middleton that he fired a 9-millimeter pistol at Mrs. Greene's head as she lay on the floor of the car service office after she was shot with a sawed-off shotgun by Mr. Waddel Winston27. Mr. Winston is to be tried in the murder later.

 3970,  1996, a, Dancers often use deliberately distorted or exaggerated movements to make their works emotionally and thematically expressive. Yet "Three," which three choreographers presented on Thursday night at Performance Space 122remained surprisingly uncommunicativealthough it was filled with distortion.

Claude Wampler's "Geisha SecretiaPanda's Glands: A Pheromonol Pursuit" was the piece that came closest to being theatrically vivid. Unfortunatelyit was also long-winded. As she kept putting on elaborate costumesmany of which made her resemble a geishaMs. Wampler seemed to be trying to act like a femme fatale. Her wiles were often amusingand there was a charming scene in which she dressed a dog as a geisha. Neverthelessthe solo was lackadaisical in its pacing.

In "I Hear Crows Crying," Yasuko Yokoshi demonstrated that she knows how to create the illusion that she is responding to invisibleyet very realpresences around her. This soloin which dancing was combined with a filmalso by the choreographersought to evoke family memories. Yet watching it was like paging through a stranger's family album.

Although strong in stage presenceLi Chiao-Ping was dramatically amorphous in two solos"Chi" and "Fin de Siecle," and in "Lattice Cuts," a duet created in collaboration with Sally Silvers. The duet got off to a compelling start when Ms. Silvers laboriously enteredclinging to the back wall as if for dear life. Nothing that followed equaled the power of that moment. JACK ANDERSON
 3565,  1999, a, The search is one of the largest joint law-enforcement operations undertaken by the two countries. Its intensity and scope suggested that officials believe that they have firm leads to help them begin to resolve the mystery surrounding the scores of people who have disappeared in the last several years.

But so farauthorities saidthey have not found a body.

The joint operation was confirmed today by the Mexican attorney generalJorge Madrazo Cuellarand the F.B.I. directorLouis J. Freeh.

Jose Larrieta Carrascodirector of Mexico's organized crime unitsaid at a news conference in El Paso that some remains had been found that may be human. They are being analyzedhe saidand he expressed confidence that the search could bear results.

''We have very concrete information as to these sites,'' he added.

David Albathe special agent in charge of the F.B.I.'s office in El Pasowho appeared with Mr. Larrietasaid 65 agents were taking part in the search at the four sites. The bureau has set up a command post in El Paso where it will bring any remains for analysis.

Mexican officials have developed extensive files on at least 100 people who have disappeared in and around Juarez. The Association of Relatives and Friends of Disappeared Personsbased in El Pasohas compiled a list of 196 people who have disappearedmost from Juarezand the Juarez newspaper Norte has a list of 120. The missing include 22 Americansofficials from both nations said.
 4510,  1993, a, Dr. Susan G. Nayfieldprogram director for the Division of Cancer Prevention at the National Cancer Institute in BethesdaMd.said"In women who take tamoxifen following surgery for breast cancerwe have observed a drop in low-density lipoprotein cholesterolor bad cholesterolthat begins within about two weeks of initiating the drug."

"What this study does," she said"is tell us that in women taking tamoxifenthere are fewer hospitalizations due to heart diseasewhich essentially means less suffering from heart disease. And it makes us confident that the cardiovascular benefits are more than just a laboratory findingthat they translate into real experiences of real women."

Women in the study group were followed for up to 13 yearswith a median follow-up period of six years. Those who received tamoxifen for two years had almost one-third fewer hospital admissions for heart disease than those in a comparison group. Those who took the drug for five years had almost two-thirds fewer admissions than those who took tamoxifen for only two years.

More than one million women worldwide are believed to be taking tamoxifen to reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrenceand some women have taken the drug for more than 10 years. Neverthelessresearchers want to determine the long-term effects of tamoxifen use. Several previous studies have hinted at increased risk of uterineliver and other cancers.

Dr. Bernard Fisherchairman of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project and a professor at the University of Pittsburghhas begun recruiting women for the national Breast Cancer Prevention Trial. The five-year study will examine the preventive benefits of tamoxifen in 16,000 women over the age of 35 who are considered at high risk of developing breast cancer. So far 9,000 women have been recruited.

 1615,  2010, a, Fisk University in Nashvillewhich wants to sell a $30 million ownership stake in its Stieglitz art collection to raise moneyplans to appeal a court decision that set limits on the salethe university announced on Wednesday.

The ownership stake is going to the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in BentonvilleArk.but the sale has raised concerns among those who question the university’s need to sell items given to it as a public trust by the artist Georgia O’Keeffewho married the photographer Alfred Stieglitz.

The university filed a notice with the Davidson County Chancery Court in Nashville that it would appeal the Nov. 3 ruling that Fisk could spend only $10 million of the $30 million at its discretion. The remainder would be placed in an independent endowment fund and Fisk would be allowed to use only about $1 million of income from the endowment to support the collectionwhich was donated to the university about 50 years ago.

“This restriction effectively confiscates proceeds from the approved sharing agreement and places Fisk in a more risky position than before,” said Hazel R. O’LearyFisk’s presidentin a statement.

Fisk’s chairmanRobert W. Nortonadded“The order will result in an excessive endowment for the art collection while ignoring the need to endow Fisk’s outstanding academic programs for which it has received national recognition.”

 5137,  1989, a, Congressional investigators issued a legal opinion today saying that Oliver L. North's conviction for destroying Government documents in the Iran-contra affair casts ''serious doubt'' on whether he is entitled to his military pension.

The opinionwhich came after the Navy had already suspended Mr. North's $23,000-a-year pensionsaid the former Marine Corps lieutenant colonel could sue the Government to win the pension back. A telephone call to Mr. North's lawyers today was not returned.

Lawyers for the Navy said earlier that they wanted to restore Mr. North's pensionbut the opinion by the General Accounting Officea Congressional investigative bodyappeared to eliminate the prospect that the Government would voluntarily reinstate the pension. The Navy asked for the opinion; the G.A.O. is authorized to advise Federal agencies on expendituresincluding pay.

The opinion was addressed to Lawrence L. LamadeGeneral Counsel of the Department of the Navy. A Navy spokesman said the service would abide by the opinionbut added that Mr. North would still be eligible for other benefits provided to retired officersincluding free medical care and commissary privileges at military bases.

 2900,  2002, a, Brendan Behanthe loquacious Irish novelist and playwright who died in 1964 of diabetes complicated by alcoholism (he was only 41)once jokingly described himself as ''a drinker with a writing problem.'' Peter Sheridan's gentlemisty-eyed screen adaptation of Behan's coming-of-age novel''Borstal Boy,'' barely hints at the marathon toper to come in a scene in which the teenage Brendan gets pleasantly tipsy on cider.

The filmset in the early 1940'sis a likable rites-of-passage memory piece doused in period nostalgiaincluding the prominent use of vintage Movietone newsreels to mark the events of World War II. While incarcerated in a Borstal (a British reform school)the teenage Brendan discovered the theater by reading Oscar Wildestood up to the institution's resident bullytried and failed to escapeand formed two romantic relationships. By the end of the filmhe has blossomed from an introverted rebel into an endearingself-assured future Great Writer.

Most of the movie is set in the reform school in East Anglia where Brendan was incarcerated after being caught taking explosives into Liverpool. A fervent Irish republicanhe was legally too young at 16 to be sent to a regular prison. As depicted in the moviethe institution lacks the ominous aura of a modern reform school and looks less like a penal institution than a Spartan summer camp. Although violence erupts thereit isn't endemic to the schoolwhose stern but kindly wardenJoyce (Michael York)genuinely cares about the young men under his charge.

As played by the American actor Shawn HatosyBrendan comes across as a wholesomesensitive idealist with a streak of sexual ambiguity. The movie puts a glowing romantic spin on Brendan's attraction to his best friendCharlie Millwall (Danny Dyer)a sailor whoalthough openly gayis not seriously harassed. When the two exchange a kissit is a liberating moment unencumbered by guilt or shame. Nor does that kiss have any effect on Brendan's deepening passion for Joyce's daughterLiz (Eva Birthistle)who returns his affection. (Behan eventually married another woman in 1955.)

Avenue was virtually deserted yesterday afternoon. But for last- minute Champagne buyersit was a frenzied moment.

At Sherry-Lehmannthe Madison Avenue wine merchanta battered number machinejust like a deli'sstood at the entrance to the crowded store.

''I'm a regular Champagne drinkerbut I do take the bottle out of the mouth,'' said Richard D. De Veauxa teacher from the Wharton School of Business Administration in Philadelphia. He bought three different bottlesone of pink Champagne. ''I'm testing them out tonight for my wedding next summer,'' he explained.

 4073,  1996, a, Just as there is a thread that joins the new school designers in Parisso there has blossomed a common spirit among the younger generation of designers in New Yorkwhich sets them apart from America's old guard.

Even if one did not know Cynthia RowleySusan LazarJill Stuart or Donna Haagone could likely correctly guess their age group: in their 30's. There is a giddy informality in their design that one would not expect to find in the work ofsaya Bill BlassDonna Karan or Ralph Lauren who have come to stand for soberimmortal clothes.

For many younger designers nowclothes seem alive for the momentvibrating with disposable chic. It is an air that both Ms. Lazar and Ms. Stuart expressed well for spring. Ms. Rowleywhile inhabiting the same universewas not as successful.

Her design locomotive was out of control with no clearly discernible direction evident amid her wide-legged trouser suitslong awning-stripe dressesruffled asymmetrical dresses and coat jackets over slim pants.
