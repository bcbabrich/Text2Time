358	 2017	a	Each week, the Open Thread newsletter will offer a look from across The New York Times at the forces that shape the dress codes we share, with Vanessa Friedman as your personal shopper. The latest newsletter appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here.Good afternoon! We are on the verge of a weekend of nail-biting anticipation, at least among a certain crowd. This coming Monday evening is the Council of Fashion Designers of America’s annual awards, a.k.a. the Oscars of the U.S. fashion industry. Did you even know it was happening? Get ready: It may have more of an impact on you than you might think.Over the last few years, the CFDA has been gradually upping the celeb-and-promotional factor of the awards, which (let’s be honest) have in the past had a tendency to feel a bit like a high school prom, only with better clothes. The same designers tend to get nominated for the same awards: For example, this year, four of the five names on the list for homecoming king — sorry, women’s wear designer of the year — have already won, sometimes more than once, and the fifth won the international designer of the year award when he was at another house. Every year I can’t help but think: Get a little imagination, people.Well, be careful what you wish for. While the same fashion names may be on the roster next week, they are dressed up (pardon the pun) with a lot of big-tent, boldface-name glam, picked to appeal to a pretty broad demographic, including those who may not think that much about designers, but know a lot about movies, politics and late-night TV. Which might possibly include you.

5069	 1989	a	For the most part those babies were either abandoned in hospitals at birth, born with drugs in their systems or brought to the hospitals suffering from neglect or abuse.The study found 58 of the children, about 60 percent, were still in foster care in 1988, many because the paper work had not been done on time. Both the city and the private agencies who place children under contract were found to be at fault. 'Results Are Shocking'The 73-page report said that in 46 percent of the cases, the agencies had failed to file a petition to end parental rights on time. In another 46 percent, the city failed to respond on time to requests to put children up for adoption or to place them elsewhere.''The results are shocking,'' Mr. Goldin said. ''These children have been shuffled from one temporary home to another. Morever, indifference has been compounded by bad judgment.''For example, the report said, the city waited seven months to respond to an adoption request, then denied the request because it was more than six months old. The child in that case, who came into foster care after being neglected, remains with foster parents who have said they will not adopt him.By law the city must respond to adoption requests within 30 days.The report said the city also failed to abide by the 30-day limit in a case involving a child who had not seen her mother in 22 months and who was listed as expected to ''return to parent.'' Although a request to put the child up for adoption was made in August 1987, the city had not responded after nine months. Deprived of AdoptionIn another case, a child who was never visited by either parent was still not freed for adoption after almost three years, the report said. Had proper procedure been followed, the child could have been adopted shortly after his first birthday. Instead, the report said, ''adoption is still in the remote future.'' The 30-Day Limit

2096	 2007	a	On paper, Hyung-Taik Lee was an unimposing roadblock for Andy Murray. Lee, a relatively stocky 31-year-old from South Korea, barely plays .500 ball. His career main-tour record coming into his match with Murray, the 19th-seeded British No. 1, was 141-141; Murray’s was 81-44.But matches aren’t played on paper. Their match this evening was being played on a hard court, and Lee had reason to think he could win. When they met in San Jose earlier this year on a hard court, the match went the distance, with Murray winning in a third-set tiebreaker.This time, on the bigger stage, Lee prevailed, winning 6-3, 6-3, 2-6, 7-5.Lee started his third-round match tonight by going up two sets to love, his brand of unspectacular but steady tennis forcing Murray to come up with something special to win points. More often than not, an agitated Murray ended points with unforced errors (Once, Murray kicked a trash can after winning a point).But he turned things around in the third set. Murray found the range on his first serve (he finished with 15 aces) while more errors started to creep into Lee’s game.Lee, however, found his game again in the fourth set. Although he twice requested treatment from a tour trainer for his back, he was able to take a 5-2 lead. Murray answered by fighting off match points and rallying to 5-all. He got a little help from Lee who clearly got tight.Lee held to 6-5. Murray, needing to hold serve again, picked the worst possible time to play a bad game. Lee took advantage, breaking Murray again to close out the match.The near loss to Murray in San Jose wasn’t the only reason Lee, a baseliner, had a real shot at upending Murray. Lee was in fine form, having beaten Guillermo Canas in the second round — and all Canas has done this year is beat Roger Federer twice on hard courts. Also potentially working in Lee’s favor was the fact that Murray is returning from a wrist injury.Lee’s workmanlike game — built more on steadiness than booming serves and rocket winners — was at its best against his opponent, a 20-year-old baseliner known to mix power with a feathery touch.Now Lee goes to the fourth round, matching his best United States Open result.Murray, with his coach Brad Gilbert, can go regroup.

2574	 2004	a	Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, the centerpiece of Donald J. Trump's struggling casino empire, reported a quarterly loss of nearly $49 million yesterday, further undermining the company's tenuous financial position and complicating its ability to meet hefty debt payments due at the end of this month and in the fall.Trump Hotels has about $1.8 billion in debt that has drained the company of the cash it needs to maintain its properties and compete effectively in the Atlantic City gambling market. Over the last few months, the company and its bondholders have been considering options to deal with the debt burden, including a prepackaged bankruptcy or a recapitalization that would cede control of the company to a major investment bank.Either option would result in a sharply decreased role at Trump Hotels for Mr. Trump, the chief executive, who has been accused by analysts and bondholders of ineffective management and slipshod financial practices.Trump Hotels said it lost $48.8 million, or $1.63 a share, in the quarter, compared with a loss of $24 million, or $1.09 a share, in the period a year earlier. Trump Hotels has never been profitable since it became a public company in 1995. The company said yesterday's losses included a provision of $19.1 million related to the payment of state taxes in Indiana. The company's quarterly revenue was $276.2 million, down from $278.8 million.

6033	 1978	a	BALDNESS undoubtedly contributed to the success of actors Yul Brynner and Telly Savalas and the high fashion model Pat Evans. But somehow the glamour of their gleaming pates never caught on with the average man or woman. While many are content merely to lament the gradual loss of their straight or curly locks, others squander millions of hard‐earned dollars in a frantic and fruitless search for ways to halt the inexorable passing of hair follicles.Short of castration, there is currently no safe and effective way to prevent or cure the most common kind of baldness that afflicts mankind. It is programmed by the genes and triggered by hormones that few would part with. No lotion or drug, no amount of massaging, oiling, brushing or washing, vitamins or minerals or protein supplements can halt or reverse the loss of hair as we get older.But there are various ways now to camouflage hereditary baldness as well as to prevent or correct other causes of hair loss. You, can avoid unnecessary damage to your hair, and you should avoid unscrupulous “hair specialists” (trichologists) who may promise you a Sampson mane but only succeed in emptying your pocket. The facts'that follow were derived mainly from two no-nonsense books about hair and its care.'One, “The AMA Book of Skin and Hair Care,” (Lippincott, 1976, $9.95), was edited by Linda Allen Schoen in Consultation with the American Medical Association's Committee on Cutaneous Health and Cosmetics. The second, “All About Hair,” (Wallingford Press, 1978, $10), was written by Dr. Herbert S. Feinberg, a New Jersey dermatologist who specializes in hair transplantation.First, it helps to know some basic facts about hair and how it grows. Normal hair growth depends on certain vitamins and minerals and aeequate protein in the diet. But this does not mean that extra amounts of these substances can halt or reverse hair Incc
1751	 2009	a	What we’re reading on Thursday morning.The Corner Where Music Never Dies: In the Rooms column of Thursday’s New York Times, Alan Feuer visits a studio on West 44th Street in Manhattan where a team from Sony Music Entertainment is preserving the company’s archives — the work of artists from Sousa and Caruso to Billie Holiday, Bob Dylan and Miles Davis. “Everything falls apart,” one archivist says. “We want to be the last best place in the world where all this stuff can be preserved.”Dudamel’s Debut: The Associated Press reports on Gustavo Dudamel‘s first rehearsal as the conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Mr. Dudamel, 28, who showed up to work in black sneakers, discusses the contents of his iPod (Oscar D’Leon, Pink Floyd, Pasion Vega and Juan Luis Guerra) and tells reporters at a press conference, “Classical music is cool.”Seattle Museum’s ‘Faustian’ Tower Deal: Writing for Bloomberg News, James S. Russell recounts the tale of the Seattle Art Museum’s 16-story extension, attached to the 42-story headquarters of Washington Mutual Inc. The extension opened in 2007 at a cost of $86 million, but its future has been jeopardized by the collapse of that bank.Wanna Be Sedated? If any subplot of “Entourage” had to come true, at least it was this one: The Hollywood Reporter says that Fox Searchlight is in negotiations to produce a biographical film about the punk rock band the Ramones, adapted from the coming memoir “I Slept With Joey Ramone” by that singer’s brother, Mickey Leigh, and Legs McNeil. No casting has been announced but Vincent Chase is presumably available.

This was an apparent reference to chaos caused by recent attempts to collectivize the country's agrarian econ omy, a policy that has been abandoned.The 66‐year‐old President left Tunisia for France on Nov. 17 for extended medical treat ment following a severe attack of hepatitis.

2204	 2006	a	Bernard H. Siegan, a conservative legal scholar whose unsuccessful nomination to a federal appellate judgeship was one of the most bitterly disputed judicial nominations of the Reagan era, died on Monday in Encinitas, Calif. He was 81 and lived in San Diego.The cause was complications of a stroke he had last year, his wife, Shelley, said.At his death, Professor Siegan was a distinguished professor of law at the University of San Diego, where he had taught for more than 30 years.In early 1987, President Ronald Reagan nominated Professor Siegan to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which comprises nine Western states, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. In July 1988, after nearly a year and a half in which Professor Siegan was publicly denounced by liberals and also by some conservatives, the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected his nomination.Professor Siegan was best known for his ardent libertarian views on economic matters, and on property rights in particular. In his many books and articles, he maintained that the Constitution protected what he called the "economic liberties" of individuals. The courts, he argued, should return to their pre-New Deal stance of enforcing such liberties.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThough Professor Siegan had his defenders, some conservatives considered his views extreme, seeing him as a "judicial activist" who thought the courts should invalidate much of the economic and social legislation of the modern era.Judge Robert H. Bork, whose nomination to the Supreme Court was rejected by the Senate in 1987, had cautioned in a 1985 speech that Professor Siegan's economic ideas could engender "a massive shift away from democracy and toward judicial rule."

1323	 2011	a	The terse announcement came just after 9:45 p.m. Sunday from Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director. “POTUS to address the nation tonight at 10:30 p.m. Eastern Time,” he wrote on Twitter, sharing the same message that had just been transmitted to the White House press corps.According to Brian Williams, the “NBC Nightly News” anchor, some journalists received a three-word e-mail that simply read, “Get to work.”The nation’s television anchors and newspaper editors did not know, at first, that President Obama would be announcing the death of Osama bin Laden, an extraordinary development in the nearly 10-year-long war against terrorism waged by the United States and its allies. But reporters in Washington suspected almost immediately that the announcement could be about bin Laden.That speculation was not aired out on television immediately, but it did erupt on Twitter and other social networking sites. Wishful thinking about bin Laden’s death ricocheted across the Web — and then, at 10:25 p.m., while Mr. Obama was writing his speech, one particular tweet seemed to confirm it. Keith Urbahn, the chief of staff for the former defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld, wrote at that time, “So I’m told by a reputable person they have killed Osama Bin Laden. Hot damn.”Mr. Urbahn quickly added, “Don’t know if it’s true, but let’s pray it is.” He was credited by many on the Web with breaking the news, though he did not have first-hand confirmation.Within minutes, anonymous sources at the Pentagon and the White House started to tell reporters the same information. ABC, CBS and NBC interrupted programming across the country at almost the same minute, 10:45 p.m., with the news. “We’re hearing absolute jubilation throughout government,” the ABC News correspondent Martha Raddatz reported.Brian Williams on NBC told viewers, “This story started to leak out in the public domain largely when some Congressional staffers started to make phone calls.”Senator Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, was speaking at a memorial service for a Democratic consultant in California and announced the death at the conclusion of her remarks. The audience, sitting by a pool in an estate on the beach in Santa Monica, gasped in shock.Government officials speaking to the media remained anonymous, as The Associated Press said, “in order to speak ahead of the president.”Mr. Obama’s address, initially planned for 10:30 p.m., was delayed repeatedly. CNN reported that he was writing the address himself.By 11 p.m., he still had not spoken, but the news was spreading virally around the world. At that time there were more than a dozen Facebook posts with the word “bin Laden” every single second. The New York Post’s Web site blared, “We Got Him!” The Huffington Post front page read, “Dead.” Around the country, Americans gathered around televisions to digest the news. “This ends a chapter in the global war on terrorism which has defined a generation,” the NBC correspondent Richard Engel said.Mr. Obama confirmed Bin Laden’s death at 11:35 p.m. Almost immediately, there was speculation in the media about whether the Obama administration would show visual evidence of the death.Shortly before midnight, the Al Jazeera English network showed live pictures of a growing crowd outside the White House chanting “USA! USA!”One Twitter user in California said her whole family was watching, including her 9-year-old child. “We’re explaining who Osama bin Laden is,” she wrote. Her child was born several months after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.Adam Nagourney contributed reporting.

6130	 1977	a	Mr. Carter told the crowd that Mr. Humphrey had touched his family's life in “strange and delightful ways” and recalled his daughter Amy sitting in the Senator's lap dribbling moist brownie crumbs. He said he also remembered that when Mr. Humphrey learned that Lillian Carter, the President's mother, was serving in the Peace Corps in India, the Senator arranged for her to be visited by the head of the Indian Peace Corps. “Who brought her very good fifth of bourbon,” the President added.Before the dinner, about 150 of the guests went to an early-evening reception at the Mondales’ official residence, a big Victorian mansion in northwest Washington, There, near a crackling fireplace in a high‐ceiling parlor lined with modern art, Luci Johnson Nugent, daughter of former President Lyndon B. Johnson, looked around at a crowd of familiar faces and said: “It's like old times.”Senator Humphrey was not among the reception guests, but dominated the conversations of those who did attend. “It has been a dream of his for a long time to put that institute together,” said Patrick O'Connor, a Minnesota lawyer. Mr. Mondale, on a receiving line with his wife, Joan, said he thought the Senator's appearance at the dinner would be difficult but rewarding. “I'll tell you what gives him the lift,” the Vice President said. “He very much wants to make his papers available to students and scholars.”Asked earlier In the day if he had not been made uncomfortable by the continuing stream of tributes and testimonials, the Senator said simply, “This statement from the 23d Psalm expresses my view iully‐.My cup runneth over.”Forty states had proclaimed Dec. 2 as Hubert H. Humphrey Day, and people from all 50 states filled the International Ballroom for the $1,000-a-plate dinner,Although the Senator is recuperating from his latest series of chemotherapy treatments for inoperable cancer of the pelvis, he nevertheless helped with organizing things.He had nothing to do with the menu of Cornish game hen and bananas flambe, he said, but the rest of the evening, bore the imprint of his hand, for he had consulted daily about plans.

4559	 1992	a	The most potent symbol in the new film "The Inner Circle" is the one audiences will never see. It's inside Lenin's head -- literally. Andrei Konchalovsky, the film's director, gained permission to shoot numerous scenes in the Moscow headquarters of the K.G.B., whose lobby is dominated by a massive bust of Feliks Dzerzhinsky, the first chief of the Soviet secret police. Mr. Konchalovsky wanted to move the sculpture and replace it with a bust of Lenin, but on this point he could not prevail. "So we simply wrapped Lenin around Dzerzhinsky," the director said, laughing. What appears on screen is a gleaming steel head of Lenin, thinking a private, very frightening thought.The nightmare that unfolded from that thought is the subject of Mr. Konchalovsky's first film on Russian themes since the highly acclaimed "Siberiade," made in 1979. "The Inner Circle" surveys the Stalin years through the eyes of Ivan Sanshin, a young, idealistic Communist who works as the Kremlin's film projectionist. The character is based on Aleksandr Ganshin, who showed films for Stalin and other top Government figures, including Lavrenti Beria, chief of the secret police. A Nation SeducedThe action of the film moves back and forth between this closed world of privilege and absolute power, portrayed in scenes shot on location in the Kremlin and in K.G.B. headquarters, and the dismal communal apartment that Ivan and his bride, Anastasiya, share with ordinary Muscovites. The film marks a dramatic return to native ground for the director, who has made films including "Tango and Cash," with Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell, and "Runaway Train," starring Jon Voight, since leaving the Soviet Union in 1979.Mr. Konchalovsky uses the metaphor of a love affair to explain his view of Stalinism. "I am trying to speak about the seduction of an entire nation," he said in a recent interview in New York City en route to his home in Los Angeles. "For that reason, Stalin had to be attractive. Evil cannot gain ground if it is not seductive."
1634	 2009	a	Primary Stages has announced that Vanessa Aspillaga (“Anna in the Tropics”), Jack Gilpin (“The Elephant Man”), Julie Halston (“Hairspray”), David Margulies (“Wonderful Town”) and Robert Christopher Riley (“Cat on a Hot Tin Roof”) have joined the cast of “Chasing Manet,” a new play by Tina Howe that is the final production of the company’s season. As previously announced, Jane Alexander and Lynn Cohen will star as residents of a nursing home who are plotting to escape for a last hurrah aboard the QE2. Previews begin March 24. …Jeffry Denman will direct and perform in “Broadway Musicals of 1924” on Feb. 23, the first installment in the ninth season of the Town Hall concert series Broadway by the Year. Marc Kudisch, Sarah Jane McMahon, Kendrick Jones and Melinda Sullivan are among the other performers. They will reprise songs from musicals like “The Student Prince,” “Rose-Marie” and “Lady Be Good.” The season will continue with installments honoring the Broadway seasons of 1931 (March 30), 1944 (May 11) and 1970 (June 15). …The Barefoot Theater Company will present a reading of “The Sins of the Mother,” by Israel Horovitz, on March 31 at 8 p.m. at the Theaters at 45 Bleecker Street, with Jo Bonney directing. The reading, which takes place on the playwright’s birthday, is the opening event for “The 70/70 Horovitz Project,” a yearlong celebration of Mr. Horovitz’s 70th birthday. The festival will include a June production of “The Widow’s Blind Date.”
3533	 1999	a	''I tried to defuse the situation,'' McPhee said. ''But the game still got out of hand.''Chicago's Dave Manson was suspended for one game for cross-checking a Washington player.McPhee's confrontation with the coach ''started in a civil manner,'' he said, ''but got out of hand.''McPhee will not be allowed to attend games or practices for the first month of the season, which begins today. He will not be able to conduct team business or even enter the team offices. In addition, the league also fined Ron Wilson, the coach of the Capitals, and Bill Wirtz, the owner of the Blackhawks.Wilson was hit for $5,000 after being quoted as having said he wished he had known that McPhee was confronting the Blackhawks because he and his players would have trailed in support. Wirtz, who will turn 70 tomorrow, was fined $3,000 for saying that the top brass of both teams could settle things by locking themselves in a room, turning out the lights and swinging away.Thank goodness the commissioner is enforcing decorum before these things escalate and pay-per-view operators get involved. Fighting remains quasi-legal in the sport, as long as it involves two consenting adults, in uniform, trading punches during the game before they rest in the penalty box for five minutes and feel the appropriate shame. It is the outside-the-lines stuff that cannot be tolerated.Earlier in the exhibition season, in a game at the same arena, Lyle Odelein of the Devils nearly came to blows with Matthew Barnaby of Pittsburgh as they walked through the corridors to the ice before the game. (Odelein still resents comments made last season by Barnaby that Odelein looks like an ape.) Later, they fought on the ice. After that game, it was decided that opposing teams in future exhibitions would be housed on opposite sides of the Columbus rink. But the distance did not deter McPhee.Confrontations outside the glass and the boards are not unusual, which is why most arenas employ big, burly security guys who are not afraid to get their knuckles scratched. Colin Campbell, the league's chief disciplinarian, went jaw to jaw and chest to chest in the Madison Square Garden corridor with Ted Nolan a couple of years ago when Campbell coached the Rangers and Nolan coached the Buffalo Sabres.
4226	 1995	a	Pilkington P.L.C. said yesterday that its first-half profit rose 35 percent, and it announced a rights offer intended to raise L303 million ($475 million) to finance acquisitions and investment. Pilkington, the world's largest supplier of automotive glass, said its profit in the six months that ended on Sept. 30 rose to L104 million ($163 million), from L77 million a year ago, aided by a 3 percent net increase in prices. The figure from the 1994 period includes a one-time gain of L16 million.The company said shareholders could buy one new share for every four they own, at a price of 155 pence ($2.43) each. The company said the rights issue was necessary to continue to expand while reducing debt. (Bloomberg Business News)
2108	 2007	a	Agnieszka Radwanska came into her third-round match-up with defending champion Maria Sharapova with a simple plan: “I’ve got nothing to lose, so I just hit the ball.”She did. Sharapova didn’t. And just like that Radwanska, the 30th seed here, has become the toast of the tournament, ousting the No. 2 seed in three sets. Asked how she’ll feel about seeing her face on the front page of every newspaper tomorrow, the 18-year-old from Poland just smiled.“Good. Very good.”Although this was a monumental upset by any measure, it wasn’t by any means a fluke, despite the fact that Radwanska was until a few months ago as worried about graduating high school as she was about her professional career. After Radwanska passed her exams she was a rising star on the women’s tour, having won in Stockholm and reaching the 3rd round at Wimbledon.As a junior, Radwanska won the French Open in 2005 and Wimbledon in 2006.Today she showed great power (particularly off the forehand), stellar defense and that rarest of commodities: The ability to forget. After taking the first set 6-4 from Sharapova, Radwanska was by her own admission “destroyed” in the second, losing 6-1.“But then I woke up,” she said, and let Sharapova help her help herself. Over the course of the third set, Sharapova missed on the forehand side, missed on the backhand side and missed on her serve.“She helped me out a lot,” Radwanska acknowledged.She also showed a sneaky streak, creeping inside the baseline Michael Chang-style, trying to draw the second serve error from Sharapova. In the seventh game, it worked, helping Radwanska to a 5-2 lead.“I knew she didn’t like if somebody is moving if she is serving, so I was trying to do something like this,” she said.Sharapova gave her opponent credit not just for that, but for not wilting under the pressure.“A lot of girls in her position, in a big stadium against a top player sometimes get a little nervous. She held on there, and all the credit to her for winning the match,” she said after the match.So what’s the first order of business for Radwanska now? She’ll pay off a bet she made with her sister.“If I beat her, we will buy two Louis Vuitton bag,” she said. After the match, her sister came to the locker room. “Okay, now we’re going to Louis Vuitton.”

4962	 1990	a	Sent to HiroshimaProfessor Fujita, who will continue his research at the university, was born in Kitakyushu, Japan. He studied sunspot movements as a teen-ager and remembers his father telling him to get down from the roof during a typhoon.In 1945, when he was an assistant professor of physics at Meiji College of Technology in Japan, he was sent to Hiroshima and Nagasaki to examine the nature and number of atomic bombs used. ''It was a dangerous game walking around three weeks after the bomb,'' he said.The experience served him well 30 years later, however, when he was asked to help find the reasons for an Eastern Airlines crash at Kennedy International Airport. He discovered that during a severe storm, violent gusts of air can move straight down, crushing houses and trees and making it impossible for planes to fly. Air, he found, would ''hit the ground very hard'' and spread out, not unlike the shock-wave patterns at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which moved from ground zero outward.Although this theory of downbursts and microbursts was initially disputed, Professor Fujita installed Doppler radar at three Chicago area airports and was able to document his findings. Now the Federal Aviation Administration is capitalizing on them with the widespread use of Doppler radar, which allows observers to measure the speed of moving objects, including wind.Tornado Teaching ToolTornadoes are Professor Fujita's other passion at Chicago. He devised a widely-used system for measuring their strength, known as the Fujita Tornado Scale, and he has studied and photographed their effects.

6466	 1970	a	The Chilean Constitution, prevented Mr. Frei from suc ceeding himself, but he could be a candidate in the 1976 presi dential elections.A new national newspaper owned by the Christian Demo cratic party appeared here this week. The newspaper, La Prensa, is part of a group of national magazines, provincial newspapers, and radio stations that are going to be, along with the Independent El Mercurio and Its affiliated newspapers, the major voices of opposition under Dr. Allende's Govern ment.“The proof of the existence of democracy,” Mr. Frei said, “lies in the opportunity for political alternatives and in loyal respect for rules of the game that accept the perma nence of political forces out side the government that can present their own vision of problems and a different opinion.”He said that the Christian Democrats, as well as ‘other non‐Marxist political groups, should be assured of .the right to compete equally in unions, neighborhood commit tees, mothers’ clubs and other local organizations that have been given official status under the Christian Democratic Gov ernment.He warned that if Chile's uni versities were converted into “battlegrounds for political loyalty,” the main function of the universities of preparing educated and technically trained persons for Chile's modernizing society would be destroyed.In an election this week at the Catholic University here, a slate of independent candidates won the leadership of the stu dent federation. The slate op posed the affiliation of the fed eration with outside political groups. It received 2,400 votes compared with 1,700 votes for a slate identified With the Pop ular Unity coalition. A left‐wing Christian Democratic slate fin ished third with 1,400 votes.The Christian Democratic party supported the election by Congress of Dr. Allende, which became necessary under the Constitution since no candidate received a majority, in the pop ular vote. However, some Chris tian Democrats voted with more enthusiasm for Dr. Allende than others, reflecting the division between the followers of Mr. Frei, a moderate, and those of Mr. Tomic.
1554	 2010	a	As if the Mets do not already have enough problems, there is now some uncomfortable ambiguity surrounding the rotation as the team heads into three-game series at Atlanta and at Philadelphia.Before Sunday’s 14-1 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks, Manager Jerry Manuel said he hoped to use the left-hander Hisanori Takahashi out of the bullpen during the trip, as he did in the week before the All-Star break. The Mets do not play Thursday, giving them the option of using a four-man rotation.But Manuel said that plan was predicated on Niese’s pitching competently Sunday, which he did not (he gave up seven runs, six earned, and was removed with one out in the fifth inning).After the game, Manuel backed away from the idea of skipping Takahashi in the rotation. He said that no decisions had been made, but he suggested that he might now be inclined to skip Niese in the rotation.“I am a believer in skipping a young guy here or there just to keep him rejuvenated for the next start,” Manuel said.That was news to the 23-year-old Niese. When told of Manuel’s comments a few minutes later, Niese said he was not aware that his skipping a start was something Manuel might consider.Niese expressed no enthusiasm about the idea.“I don’t want to skip a start,” he said flatly. “I want to be out there every five days. I feel good. So if I feel good, I want to be out there.”

4928	 1990	a	If there's a typical letter from readers of this column, it's something like this one I recently received from a New York City resident:''Help! I need it desperately. I am in the market for a new point-and-shoot camera to replace a Canon Sure-Shot, which was stolen last summer. I reverted to using my old, beloved Minolta Autocord, but find it somewhat cumbersome, heavy and expensive when it comes to processing.''I have done research and am most confused. I want a zoom camera that is reliable, not too difficult to handle and which incorporates all the lastest features - although I am confident that a week after I make my purchase, several new models will be in the stores. As of now, I have narrowed the field to six cameras with a side-glance at a seventh. They are, not in order of preference:''Minolta Freedom Zoom 90, Nikon Zoom 500, Olympus Infinity 200, 300 and 330, Pentax IQ Zoom, and a side-glance to the Olympus AZ-4 Zoom.'' The letter goes on to note the urgency of my response, since a trip to an exotic foreign locale is impending.First of all, my ability to respond to letters asking for camera advice is limited by the number of requests for same that regularly arrive in my pathetically miniscule mailbox. Second, I have to congratulate this particular reader for the intelligence with which she went about finding cameras that seem to fit her needs. And third, I need to clear up some misconceptions about camera shopping.Personally, I hate shopping of any sort. The process seems designed to lead one from total ignorance to total confusion. Most salespeople just make it worse. So, like many consumers, I read up on the subject of my purchase first. If the subject is cameras, I would buy magazines like Popular Photography, Photo District News or Consumers Reports to see what's out there. I'd also poll my friends who have cameras to see what they're using these days.
91	 2019	a	“Pretty Woman,” a musical adaptation of the 1990 romantic comedy starring Julia Roberts, will close in August after a year on Broadway, the show announced Wednesday.With music and lyrics by the pop songwriters Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance, the production was the latest effort to retool a hit movie for the stage. The show was capitalized for up to $17 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but after a strong start, the box office fell off considerably; the musical grossed $538,552 for the week ending June 30 — only 39 percent of its potentia l.In a season that also included the adaptations of the movies “Beetlejuice” and “Tootsie,” “Pretty Woman,” which Jerry Mitchell directed, was harshly reviewed and didn’t pick up any Tony Award nominations. At the time of its Aug. 18 closing it will have played 27 previews and 421 regular performances.From the start, the musical faced an especially knotty challenge: how to modernize the movie’s male-savior plot for a post-#MeToo audience. Could Vivian, the hooker with a heart of gold played by Ms. Roberts in the film, be the savior this time around? Despite the feminist gloss, the show still “hewed suffocatingly close to the film’s story, gags and dialogue,” Ben Brantley wrote in his review for The New York Times.

(Click on links for complete stories.)“It was just a total release.

4302	 1994	a	THE corroding copper mansard on top of the building at 86th Street and Riverside Drive has long been a curiosity. Now a co-op shareholder is sprucing up the 100-foot-long space into what will surely be one of the show apartments of New York.But even completed, the new apartment will only be a small fraction of what it was in its original incarnation: the largest apartment in New York City, William Randolph Hearst's custom-built quintuplex.In the 1890's the young Hearst came to New York, buying The Morning Journal in 1896 and battling Joseph Pulitzer's World for circulation. He later launched The Evening Journal and by 1908 had major newspapers in five cities. Hearst also served as a Representative in Congress and stoked his appetite for politics with campaigns for Mayor of New York City, Senator, Governor and even President -- none of them successful.In April 1907, when he was living in a brownstone at the corner of 28th Street and Lexington Avenue, the Real Estate Record & Guide reported that he would build a mansion at the southeast corner of 105th Street and Riverside Drive. But Hearst, perhaps seeing that Riverside Drive's days as a street of private houses had ended, soon arranged with Ranald Macdonald, a developer building a conventional 12-story apartment house at the southeast corner of 86th Street and Riverside Drive, to take over the top and possibly other floors in the building.

Explore current similarities between the United States and historic empires around the world by reading and discussing “All Roads Lead to D.C.”3. Consider the impact of various empires throughout world history and develop a deeper understanding of what an empire is by researching historic empires and creating classroom posters that include timelines, maps and other graphics.4. “Invent” their own modern-day or futuristic empires and create travel guides offering information about them to tourists.Resources / Materials:-student journals-pens/pencils-paper-classroom blackboard-copies of “All Roads Lead to D.C.” (one per student)-resources examining the histories of various empires, including Greek, Roman, Persian, Chinese, French, Spanish and British (world history textbooks, library resources, computers with Internet access, etc.)-six pieces of poster board-markersActivities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Prior to class, write the following definitions from Merriam-Webster’s Word Central Online Dictionary on the board:“Empire: a major political unit with a large territory or a number of territories or peoples under one ruler with total authority, especially one having an emperor as chief of state.Republic: a government having a chief of state who is not a monarch and who is usually a president; a government in which supreme power belongs to the citizens through their right to vote.”Upon entering class, students should read these definitions and respond to the following prompt in their journals (also written on the board prior to class): “What similarities and differences exist between these types of political structures? Do you think one type of political structure is better than the other? Why or why not? Which one of these structures does the United States have, and why do you think this? What other countries can you name that fit each of these two types of governments?” After a few minutes, students share their answers. Students likely classified the United States as a republic. How might it be argued that the United States is an empire?2. As a class, read and discuss the article “All Roads Lead to D.C.,” focusing on the following questions:a. What do many scholars believe is the international political role of the United States?b. In what four ways is the United States a powerful force, according to the article?c. What political label do foreigners give Americans, and why?d. Are scholars accepting the ideas behind this label, and why?e. How is Mr. Boot’s idea of an empire affected by the attacks of September 11?f. What does Mr. Boot believe countries like Afghanistan need?g. How is America’s “empire” different from empires of the past?h. Where does Mr. Kaplan suggest politicians turn for guidance in the 21st century?i. What does Mr. Kaplan believe will lead the United States to have more international power?j. How did America show imperialist behavior during the colonial era?k. What does Mr. Kennedy believe to be a clear sign that the United States is an empire?l. How do scholars claim America “conquers” other nations?m. What is a positive result of the United States being a large empire?3. Explain that students will now be conducting research on different empires in history to deepen their understanding of what an empire is and how an empire can have both positive and negative effects on the countries and peoples around them. Divide students into six groups, and allow each group to choose a different empire mentioned in the article “All Roads Lead to D.C.”: Rome under Tiberius, Rome under Charlemagne, Persia, China, France under Napoleon and Spain under Philip II. (Note that you can extend this activity to include other historic empires as well.) Using all available classroom materials, each group should answer the following questions about their historic empire, and then create a classroom poster with the information (written on the board for easier student access):–Where was your group’s empire located? Find a map that shows its location then, and locate on a current map where the empire’s boundaries would be now.–How and when did this empire come into being? Create a timeline on your poster of major events in this empire from its inception to its fall. Include the names and dates of different key leaders of the empire.–How was this empire structured in terms of its government? Create a flow chart explaining the “chain of command” during this time period.–What were this empire’s international interests, and how did it act on those interests? What countries represent potential friends or enemies? Include this information graphically on the maps that you have included.–What was this empire’s economic structure, and how was it related to its international interests?–What cultural and technological developments occurred during and as a result of this empire? Locate pictures of different pieces of art, artists, musical instruments, technologies, scientific discoveries and other related developments from this empire to include on your poster.If necessary, posters may be finished for homework or in a future class period. They should then be displayed around the world.4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: With their new understanding of empires from the article read in class and from their group research, each student or group “invents” their own modern-day or futuristic empire and creates a travel guide offering information about it to tourists. Students should consider (and include in their illustrated guides) all of the questions posed in the historical empire research conducted in class. Students should present their empires in a future class.Further Questions for Discussion:–What were the Punic Wars, and how were they important to the development of the idea of imperialism?–Do you think today’s politicians should read ancient Greek and Roman historical accounts for advice on how to run their nations? Why or why not?–How do you think the United States uses economic, political and cultural forces to influence other nations? What examples can you offer?–Do you think that American politics are turning foreigners into Americans? Why or why not?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on initial journal response, participation in class and group discussions, careful group investigation and thoughtful completion of historic empire posters, and creation of imaginary empires and travel guides.Vocabulary:dazzle, hegemony, empire, imperialist, eminent, isolationist, paeans, assertive, enlightened, jodphurs, pith, multipolar, merely, pagan, ethos, navigate, despot, tenacity, leverage, classicist, scoff, pax, anarchic, rogue, benignExtension Activities:1. In writing, create a debate between current or past scholars on whether or not the United States is an empire. List three arguments supporting the argument and three counterpoints with which the opposition might respond.2. Research the United States’ current role in the world as an “empire” to another empire mentioned in the article. How does each nation compare to the definition of “empire” used in the initial classroom activity? How do these nations compare to each other? How can you account for these similarities and differences? Present your findings in the form of a newspaper article written in response to “All Roads Lead to D.C.”3. With a partner, create a timeline of American foreign policy since World War I. (Places to begin looking include the Monroe Doctrine, Roosevelt Corollary, Kellogg-Briand Pact and Neutrality Acts.) Write a short explanation of any patterns you notice regarding the nation’s involvement in foreign affairs. Choose one issue, and research it further. Write a position paper explaining whether or not American involvement was necessary or justifiable in this situation, and present your findings in a future class.4. In Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s “Quarantine Speech” (October 5, 1937), the President stated: “The peace, the freedom, and the security of 90 percent of the population of the world is being jeopardized by the remaining 10 percent who are threatening a breakdown of all international law and order. Surely the 90 percent who want to live in peace under law and in accordance with standards that have received almost universal acceptance through the centuries, can and must find some way … to preserve peace.” Do you believe it is more important for the United States to look out for the whole world, or to focus only on what threatens the country directly? Back up your response with facts from the article “All Roads Lead to D.C.” and additional research conducted in class. Present your written analysis in a future class.5. Explore the United States military. How is it organized? How is it controlled? How do agencies like the C.I.A. and F.B.I. fit into the structure of the military? What role does military power play in the definition of “empire”? Create an encyclopedia or textbook entry with your responses.Interdisciplinary Connections:Geography-Create a world map showing the countries that the United States has been involved with since World War I. Incorporate symbols representing the reasons for American involvement.-Research and collect proof that American culture is popular everywhere. What is the definition of American culture, and how is this manifested throughout the world? Create a chart showing how American institutions are represented in other cultures. (Examples might include music such as hip hop and pop, fast food chains such as McDonald’s and Pizza Hut, television show trends like reality television and game shows, and clothing such as Levi’s jeans and Nike sneakers.)Journalism- Collect international headlines from newspapers or magazines for an entire week. How do your clippings justify or refute the position that the United States is an empire?Media Studies- How do foreign media outlets present current United States foreign policy? Choose a situation in which the United States is currently involved in another country’s affairs, such as Afghanistan, Somalia, Israel, Cuba, Colombia and Nicaragua. Compare media coverage at News Directory (//www.newsdirectory.com), and write a report describing how the United States coverage of an event or region differs from other world coverage of the same event or region.Other Information on the Web:The Age of Imperialism (//www.smplanet.com/imperialism/toc.html) offers a history of United States expansionism in Asia, the Pacific, and the Americas.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8Historical Understanding Standard 2- Understands the historical perspective.

4921	 1990	a	A former bank executive who was charged with helping Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos transfer $168 million from the Philippines to the United States pleaded guilty yesterday to mail fraud.Under a plea agreement, the executive, Rodolfo T. Arambulo, will help the prosecution in its case against Mrs. Marcos, which is expected to go to trial on March 20, Federal officials said.Mrs. Marcos is accused of pirating the money from the Philippine treasury and investing it in real estate in the United States, including Manhattan. Mr. Marcos, who died last year, was also charged.Mr. Arambulo's plea came two days after he surrendered to the Federal authorities. Mr. Arambulo, the 57-year-old former president of the California Overses Bank in Los Angeles, could receive a maximum five-year prison term and a fine of $250,000 under the agreement. He will be sentenced by Judge John F. Keenan of Federal court in Manhattan.

3101	 2001	a	Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students estimate the amount of money a non-smoking teen spends in a week, a month, and a year, and compare it with the expenses of a teen who smokes one, two, and three packs a day. They then research other reasons that teens should not smoke, and create an ad campaign geared toward young people emphasizing the financial and health benefits of not smoking.Author(s):Jackie Glasthal, The New York Times Learning NetworkSuggested Time Allowance: 1 hourObjectives:Students will:1. Compare the amount of money a smoker and a non-smoker spends weekly, monthly, and annually.2. Learn about the correlation between the price of cigarettes and teen smoking by reading and discussing “Vital Signs: When Smoking Is a Matter of Money.”3. Work in groups to identify reasons why young people should not smoke.4. Create ad campaigns that encourage teens to quit or to not start smoking.Resources / Materials:-student journals-pens/pencils-paper-classroom blackboard-copies of “Vital Signs: When Smoking Is a Matter of Money” (one per student)-poster board, markers, crayons, old magazines, and other art materials that can be used to create students’ advertising campaigns-reference materials with information about the health risks of cigarette smoking (computers with Internet access, encyclopedias, textbooks, library references)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following questions (written on the board prior to class): “About how much money would you estimate that a smoker spends on cigarettes a week? A month? A year? If the price of cigarettes were to go up, do you think fewer people would smoke? Why or why not?” After 5 minutes, discuss student responses as a class. To check students’ estimates, assume a price of $3.50 for a pack of cigarettes. Thus, a pack-a-day smoker would spend about $24.50 a week, $98 a month, and $1,176 a year. A 2-pack a day smoker would spend $49 a week, $196 a month, and $2,352 a year, and a 3-pack-a-day smoker would spend $73.50 a day, $294 a month, and $3,528 a year. Invite students to compare this with what they estimate they spend daily, weekly, monthly, and annually on other things that they buy.2. As a class, read and discuss “Vital Signs: When Smoking Is a Matter of Money,” focusing upon the following questions:a. What, according to a new study, is the link between teen smoking and the price of cigarettes?b. How many students were surveyed in the study?c. Over what period of time was the study conducted?d. How did this study compare with other similar studies that have been done?e. What basic economic rule does this study help to prove?f. Why were some experts unsure that this rule would apply to cigarette smoking?g. What other fundamental fact of teens’ lives, according to the article, does this study help prove?3. Encourage students to identify reasons why young people should not smoke, and list them on the board. (Reasons could include cost, the effects of smoking on the body, environmental damage, irritation to others and unattractive appearance.) Divide students into groups, assign each group to one of these topics, and have them brainstorm ways in which they could create an ad campaign for teens encouraging them not to smoke, focusing on this topic. Students might want to conduct some brief research to gather statistics or to look at current and past ad campaigns.4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Each group, focusing on the topic brainstormed in class, creates two magazine or billboard ads geared toward teens encouraging them to quit or to not start smoking. Ads should be displayed around the school once they are complete.Further Questions for Discussion:–Which do you think is a better reason not to smoke: the amount of money that would be saved, or the health risks involved in smoking?–Which do you think makes for a better ad campaign: financial reasons, or health-related reasons for not smoking? Why do you think that is?–How do you feel about current ad campaigns that try to convince kids not to smoke? Do you find them appealing? Convincing? Why or why not? How do you feel these campaigns could be made better?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based upon written journal entries, participation in class discussions, and thoughtful anti-smoking ad campaigns.Vocabulary:vital, likelihood, surveying, percent, decreased, substance, abuse, affect, public health, economics, tobacco, adhere, fundamental, principles, disposable, incomeExtension Activities:1. Survey smokers and potential smokers (including the teachers) at your school to determine whether a 10 percent increase in the price of cigarettes would affect their current smoking habits (or the possibility of their starting one). Include questions in your survey that would also help to determine what other factors people think would affect whether or not they quit, or start smoking, in the first place. Graph your survey results, and then share them with the class.2. Create an ad campaign for a different “target group” (i.e. women, minority smokers, older smokers, etc.) to encourage them to stop, or to not start smoking. To do so, you will need to determine which factors might have more impact on these target groups that might not mean as much to teens.3. Visit The Truth.com (//www.thetruth.com/main.cfm?fl=0) and compare its ad campaigns against smoking with the ones that you and your fellow classmates created. Also with the smoking-related public service announcements (PSAs) you have seen on television. Which ads do you find to have the most impact? Smallest or no impact? Select one of the ads at The Truth.com and one of the PSAs that you have seen on television and write a critique comparing the impacts of each.4. Research some of the more modern techniques that people have tried to help them quit smoking, such as The Patch, Nicorette gum, acupuncture, hypnosis, and so on. Create a chart on which you list each of these methods, describing what it is, how it is supposed to work, and the comparative effectiveness of each. Post your chart on a wall of your classroom for others to see.5. Read more about why RJ Reynolds decided to end its Joe Camel ad campaign (//gabrielmedia.org/news/joecamelexit.html). Then, in a round table discussion, discuss whether or not you think this ad campaign really had been geared toward young people and whether or not you think the company made the right decision by phasing it out.Interdisciplinary Connections:American History- Imagine that it is January 11, 1964 and the Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service, Luther L. Terry, M.D., has just released the first Surgeon General’s Report on Smoking and Health. What does it say? What is the reaction of people to it? Research and write an article that might have been done on the topic at the time. Or, as an alternative, write a letter to Luther Terry, describing to him what effect this first Surgeon General’s Report had on American society and on the role that cigarettes play in it.Civics- In 1997, RJ Reynolds and other tobacco companies agreed to a settlement with a coalition of states that had sued the tobacco companies to recover the costs of treating tobacco-related health problems. After researching more about ruling, and the final verdict, imagine that you are the judge and determine what you think would be an appropriate punishment, penalty or fine, for these tobacco companies. Then compare your decision with that of the actual settlement (//www.stic.neu.edu/settlement/6-20-settle.htm).Economics- In addition to their association with tobacco products, the Philip Morris Companies are also the owners of Kraft Foods and the Miller Brewing Company. Research what products (other than cigarettes) they produce, what their corporate policies are, where else they put their corporate efforts, and other business-related information about them. Then create a company profile about them to share with your class.Other Information on the Web:The American Lung Association Web site (//www.lungusa.org/index2.html) is a comprehensive resource providing information about tobacco control, asthma, air quality, diseases associated with smoking, data, programs, local ALA chapters, and a press center. This is also the site of Smoke-Free Class of 2000 (just scroll down the home page until you see the link), a site designed for kids that offers news, activities, advocacy information, tobacco factoids, and links to related web sites.Surgeon General’s Report for Kids, SGR 4 Kids (//www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/osh/sgr4kids/sgrmenu.htm) is an online magazine from the Surgeon General with facts about kids and smoking, the effects of tobacco, and what you can do to help make the world smoke-free.Action on Smoking and Health (//ash.org) is a non-profit organization dedicated solely to protecting the rights of the non-smoking majority.CDC’s Tobacco Information & Prevention Sourcepage (//www.cdc.gov/tobacco/) contains tobacco-related news, research, cessation information, educational materials, Surgeon General’s Reports, and “TIPS4Kids.”The American Cancer Society (//www.cancer.org) is dedicated to helping everyone who faces cancer through research, patient services, early detection, treatment, and education.State Tobacco Information Center (//www.stic.neu.edu) provides state-by-state coverage of litigation against the tobacco industry including full text litigation documents.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8Health Standard 2- Knows environmental and external factors that affect individual and community health.

2493	 2005	a	Readers respond to David Brooks’s Dec. 1 column, “The Age of Skepticism“:Maureen Scott, Kansas City, Mo.: I feel obligated to respond to the following portion of your latest column in the context of the Great Depression: “As the Harvard economist Benjamin Friedman has observed, Americans begin social reforms when they are feeling confident, not when they are weary and insecure.”At the depths of the Depression, social reforms took priority . . . To say that the nation was feeling confident at that time would be a misnomer. It took the overwhelming will of a strong leader, Roosevelt, to keep on message about the positive nature of our nation to set reforms in motion.What we lack right now, as a nation, is a strong leader who we can rally around. I see no such persons in our political parties that are ready to step up to this challenge, to overcome partisan politics and do what is necessary for the future of this nation. THAT is what makes me weary and insecure. We need another Lincoln to overcome the divides and remind us what this country was founded upon.Ted Brown, San Francisco: Your essay today provides an interesting bookend to your piece on the unappreciated heroism of our troops.The common theme in both, it seems to me, is one I’ve seen in a lot of political writing in the past 10 years. In different ways, for instance, both E.J. Dionne and Christopher Lasch have discussed the retreat of Americans from responsibilities outside of their own property lines, their own private circle of concerns. Is it any wonder that the exurbs are a popular, attractive residence destinations for millions of Americans? A place where the evils of the world, like poverty and disease and war, are kept at bay, or at least vicariously experienced through violent video games, a place where personal dreams and ambitions are fostered without much care for civic or patriotic sentiments and habits.What should our government do given these circumstances? I think, in part, this willed personal isolation explains the appeal of current conservative politics to so many Americans — the idea that governance is somehow a problem, not an essential part and positive good of any civilization. In a subtle way, it’s an easy step to see civic obligations and patriotic sacrifice as part of the evils of government. After all, don’t such sensibilities force us to connect with our political institutions? And this is why this administration has failed in its leadership it has neither asked nor inspired the majority of Americans to commit to the war on terrorism, or in day-to-day terms, to drive an economy car instead of an S.U.V. because we need to save our resources to win this war.Michael Koplow, Woburn, Mass.: It is not as bad as you suggest. It is a question of leadership in this country, and as you well know but seldom state, our leaders in Washington under this administration are woefully unqualified to manage the country’s affairs.Why not state the obvious reason for such skepticism in the U.S. the incompetence of the current administration. If we get capable leadership, the public’s skepticism will evaporate.Paul Corning, San Francisco: One of the most significant social changes in my lifetime happened with the transition to Ronald Reagan’s presidency.If I remember correctly, it happened not at a time when Americans were feeling confident, but at a point of near despair over our economy and our power in the world. Reagan’s reforms pale in comparison to FDR’s, which were larger and were attempted during far more difficult times.It is pain and fear that encourages us to change. Unfortunately, we probably have a lot of both ahead before we get serious about change.Steven Campbell, Oakland, Calif.: While I agree with Mr. Brooks that we are living in a time when the American people view their government with equal measures of skepticism and cynicism, I am once again disturbed by his unwillingness to put much of the blame where it belongs — the Republican Party.While I agree that the Democratic Party is far from blameless, the Republicans have practically made cynicism their political strategy. After 9/11, President Bush had the opportunity to put his money where his mouth was and actually be the uniter he claimed to be. Unfortunately, he instead squandered national unity and resolve on partisan political goals, putting party before country.When politicians clear cut trees in the name of healthy forests, or weaken air pollution controls and call it clear skies, is it any wonder that the American people are cynical?Tim Potter, Oceanside Calif.: You are right on the money when you say that the American public is skeptical about the U.S. government’s ability, especially this Bush administration, to ‘solve the deep problems that are rooted in history and culture.’This skepticism was cured on Vietnam and Watergate. I disagree that it leads or will lead to passivity. If a person is let down enough by a situation, or others, long enough, they figure out eventually that they can not rely on that situation or persons, and that they need to take matters into their own hands. The most successful people throughout history have not waited for anyone to give them permission to realize their dreams.I submit that what is happening now is a new awakening, where people are seeing behind the veil of illusion that government as it is now solves our problems, initiates change or meaningfully effect our lives.Albert Sayers, Pound Ridge N.Y.: There is one component you missed in your essay about cynicism and that is honesty. I have heard you over and over again say that how we got into the war is over and how we are going to go forward is what matters and so let’s go.Yes, We need to move forward. But people understand when they have been deceived and that is how they feel now. They know there were no W.M.D.’s, especially nuclear ones that scared us all to death. They know the occupation was bungled but they hear the administration saying the insurgents are in their last throes. If the administration did not lie about W.M.D. and it was the intelligence that was bad, they want to know why the president gave the head of the C.I.A. a medal! . . . It just does not add up.On Sunday Sen. Warner said the president should have a fireside chat like Roosevelt did. What made those chats work is that when he told you what was going to happen and why the facts unfolded to support his statements. That builds trust. Misleading the people leads to cynicism.Lastly, when you treat people who disagree with you . . . with contempt you are in fact saying you have contempt for the system that gives them their voice in the first place. . .
4449	 1993	a	If Thursday's concert by Nicolas Collins, Joel Ryan, Ray Edgar and the Soldier String Quartet at the Kitchen had a collective message, it was similar to the one that music has been getting recently from the downtown school of electricity. The traditional artistic process is upended: no more the stepwise progression from materials to technique to beautiful object; now the art is in the materials themselves. How they are organized is anticlimax.Midway through the evening, Mr. Ryan unwound wire across the stage, plugged it into a terminal and strolled back and forth, manipulating its length and rubbing it with a bow. Synthetically generated metaphors for human gesture and man-made sounds boomed and creaked from loudspeakers. The process was repeated a little later through the proximity of hand-held objects to various microphones.This dialogue between man and machine had been introduced a few minutes before in Mr. Collins's "Broken Light," in which fragments of the Italian Baroque are electronically accelerated, spit out and responded to by the Soldier's four players. Whether by accident or on purpose, there was more a sense of music here than in the two Collins items that came before. "Lightning Strikes Not Once but Twice" and "Sound for Picture," two vignettes on the blind and the deaf, seemed more interesting for their narratives than for the bland electronic sound behind them.Mr. Edgar's "Flexsonica II" found the performer, hands wired for sound, bending and caressing a metal bar. Here, an engineer of sorts happily shared empirical discoveries in sound. This Cybertronics series continues on April 16 and 17. Brush up on your applied science. This is a little like a visit to a new-inventions fair.

3360	 2000	a	When garter snakes slithered through the lobby of a Wall Street office building early last month, workers were understandably terrified.''People were doing 100-yard dashes to get to the door,'' said Timothy Faison, a security guard at the Water Street Towers on Maiden Lane. ''It was ridiculous.''The snakes were an unexpected part of a series of seven art installations made of shredded tires, which the artist, Steven Siegel, had assembled in his studio in Dutchess County, north of New York City. But unknown to anyone, garter snakes had laid eggs inside the tires. When the eggs hatched, the reptiles wiggled out.Mr. Siegel, an environmental artist, said the sculptures were intended to illustrate the relationship between humans and natural resources. But many people who saw the snakes thought he was making a statement about Bridgestone/Firestone, the company that is recalling 6.5 million tires that have been linked to more than 100 deaths.

1172	 2012	a	Raf Casert/Associated PressSATURDAY’S PUZZLE — Mmm … fresh and crunchy. Just the thing for a Saturday.Tim Croce offers us nine, count ’em, nine 15s and while only three of them are new, they’re all terrific on their own. I loved IT TAKES A VILLAGE, people, and DIAMOND JIM BRADY. Watch out for the CONCEALED WEAPON near the center of the grid.Stop to enjoy the wordplay of “Brand new toy?” at 9 Down (PUP), “It’s next to nothing in Nogales” (UNO) and “New arrival of the 1950s?” (BOOMER) while you’re solving.A refreshingly open grid and an entertaining solve, Mr. Croce.Let’s take a ROUNDABOUT ROUTE to the Variety puzzle and the big grid:Your thoughts?
4212	 1995	a	Irony, a particularly gentle variety that by no means excludes compassion, is Mr. Bennett's element, and it is an anomaly in a country where audiences prefer their drama writ large and confessional and their comedy on the knee-slapping side. Even in his native England, Mr. Bennett is perceived as unusually oblique. He was certainly the quietest and most cryptic of the quartet of comedians that surfaced in the early 1960's with "Beyond the Fringe," the revue that also introduced Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Jonathan Miller.And throughout his career as a playwright, actor and winningly apologetic cultural pundit, critics have tended to go through his works like beaters on a grouse hunt, trying to scare up clues to the author's real identity. (A reviewer of the 1980 play "Enjoy" seemed to find the writer in a character who spent his time on stage in drag, which, Mr. Bennett notes, "presupposes that I spend my evenings idly running my finger along a rack of strapless evening gowns and adjusting my slingbacks. Now it can be told.")Readers of "Writing Home" may experience a similar sense of frustration. Mr. Bennett talks a fair amount about himself, but it is self as defined almost exclusively by self-consciousness, a free-floating, pained awareness of everything he isn't and of life as a minefield of potential embarrassments. His lower-middle-class childhood in Leeds was notable, he insists, only for its non-eventfulness; and characters in his plays who are "passive, dejected, at odds with themselves," are, he writes, "that old friend, the Writer in Disguise" (with or without slingbacks). Creating the secondary roles in his plays comes easily but the central character, he says, is usually "a blank, a puzzle, and one which I hope the actor will solve for me."This, in fact, is a large part of Mr. Bennett's strength as a playwright: his unwillingess to reduce personality to explanatory psychology or social context, though he has a strong sense of both. Whether they are privileged schoolboys who grew up to betray their country; the timid, resentful shut-ins in the monologues in "Talking Heads"; a George III surprised by madness; a fame-shunning Franz Kakfa or even Queen Elizabeth II (in the second half of "Single Spies"), Mr. Bennett's people remain, to some degree, conundrums, above all to themselves.This view of humanity also infuses the diary entries, one of which reads simply, "A man rooting in the dustbin stops suddenly and looks at his watch." The same quizzical, nonjudgmental gaze is focused, with fascinating results, on such well-known professional colleagues as John Gielgud and Lindsay Anderson, on a hilarious trip through the Soviet Union and, in invaluably informative accounts, on the surreal parallel universes created during theater and film productions.
2227	 2006	a	Plenty of readers, including many teachers, were indignant at my Sunday column calling for easier accreditation of teachers in public schools. Here’s a sampling….Ann writes: “I taught art with an alternative certification….the principal who hired me wanted an artist instead of an art teacher…. I loved the job. I loved the kids. After getting my first paycheck I realized I could not make ends meet, or even come close on my teachers paycheck. I had to work two jobs. When my photo lab bill was more than my take home pay I had to leave teaching so I could support my own children…. Alternative certification is great, but until teachers are paid what they are worth you will never fill the classrooms with the teachers our children deserve, certified or otherwise.”Steve from New York writes: “I completely agree with your observations in the above cited article. Schools of Education should be abolished. I never met a teacher who learned anything useful in an education course. [I have] 40 years experience teaching H.S. Biology.”Caroline writes: “The reason there are so many requirements for teachers to be certified is to make money for colleges. If teachers have to continue to go to school over a thirty year career, colleges make money. Bottom line: I have taught for thirty-five years. You are correct in your observation that we aren’t getting the best and brightest young people. None of our daughters have gone into teaching. Pay has to be increased, and the blame has to be put elsewhere for the failure of children….By the way, more knowledge doesn’t mean a better teacher. Colin Powell would last one day in my inner city second grade. He would not have lasted an hour in my eighth grade classes.”Martha from Seattle writes: “Unless you’re quite wealthy, it’s hard to leave a conventional job for a teaching job. Getting a certificate just isn’t that hard — it’s supporting a family on less than $40,000 a year that is. When we start paying teachers more, we will have more of them. And if we pay them well enough, we will once again attract the best and brightest to the field.”Jack, a principal from Fresno, CA, writes: “Perhaps if we increased salaries for teachers, more smart people would be inclined to work in our profession.”Miriam from Warwick writes: “Your article confuses the issues. First, current teaching programs for the most part fail to yield competent professionals. Ask any parent in a public school. That needs to be fixed. The solution to that problem is not uncertified professionals. Second, most students leave college with enormous debt. Even if the student wants to teach, teaching salaries are less than adequate to service that debt, so there is no choice about teaching. Again, the solution is not uncertified professionals. It is certainly possible to draft guidelines for advanced degree candidates who are not otherwise certified to teach. The truth is that most school districts are opposed to this because the NEA, the certified teacher’s union, won’t agree.”Julie from Sturgeon Bay, WI writes: “While Meryl Streep would likely make a dynamite acting teacher, the idea of solving America’s teacher shortage by relaxing certification requirements seems quaint. As a teacher, I believe the real issue is our nation’s lack of commitment to education. We should scrap the moronic No Child Left Behind, take some of our ridiculous military budget and shift it to education, reduce class size by half, and give teachers what they need to do their jobs, including a respectable salary! Respecting professional educators would go a long way towards recruiting gifted teachers.”
4289	 1994	a	In a move that threatens to disrupt relations, the Chief Justice of Singapore rejected appeals from President Clinton today and ordered that an American teen-ager be flogged for spray-painting cars and other mischief in this prosperous, order-loving city-state.The case of Michael Fay, 18, of Dayton, Ohio, raises the prospect of a rift between the United States and one of its closest allies and trading partners in Southeast Asia, and American diplomats immediately protested the decision by the Chief Justice, Yong Pung How, to uphold the flogging sentence.Mr. Fay has confessed to spray-painting cars and throwing eggs at other vehicles. He was sentenced to four months in prison and six lashes with a half-inch-thick rattan cane, a punishment that results in permanent scars and usually sends prisoners into shock.President Clinton intervened in the case in early March, describing the caning sentence as "extreme" and asking Singapore to reconsider. 'An Excessive Penalty'
4572	 1992	a	In the last few days, environmental arguments against a huge new hydroelectric project proposed in Quebec have become far more likely to force further delay in the signing of a 20-year, $19.5 billion contract between Hydro-Quebec and the New York Power Authority, and in the project's construction.At a forum Thursday night in Manhattan, the chairman of the Power Authority, Richard M. Flynn, said that an environmental review of the project's effects in Canada, including effects on native Cree and Inuits, might take 18 months to three years. Therefore, he said, his agency will not sign the agreement by Nov. 30 as it earlier agreed."We're certainly not going to finalize agreement while there are important questions left on either side of the border," Mr. Flynn said.The authority, under pressure from environmentalists in New York, had asked Hydro-Quebec, which is developing the project east of Hudson Bay in northern Quebec, to determine its effects on animal and plant species. Opponents argue that it would destroy a wilderness, harm animal species and increase mercury pollution.

5072	 1989	a	Faiyazuddin Dagar, a singer whose family has been performing its own tradition of Hindu classical music for 19 generations - since the 15th century - died of a heart attack Feb. 7 in New Delhi. He was 55 years old.Mr. Dagar and his brother, Zahiruddin, had toured the world singing in a style of dhrupad, an ancient devotional form of raga, named Dagarbani after the family. In Dagarbani style, the two brothers sang in overlapping, conversational phrases; one of the oldest surviving Indian classical traditions, drhupad is both meditative and virtuosic. The Dagar brothers were widely praised for their control and concentration.The Dagar brothers were born in Indore in the state of Madhya Pradesh, and studied with their father and their elder brothers, Aminuddin and Mahinuddin Dagar, for 20 years before performing in public.Mr. Dagar is survived by his wife, four daughters, a son and two brothers.
5586	 1986	a	To the Editor: Not mentioned in ''What's Doing in Palermo'' was a religious site (and sight) that, while not for the faint at heart, is fascinating. In the lower level of the Capuchin monastery, nearly 2,000 bodies, embalmed and preserved in oils and chemicals over the centuries, repose above ground in various stages of decay, fully dressed, down to shoes and hats.The monks wanted people to see what happens after death so that the faithful would behave in life. It is truly haunting.As advised in the article, we discussed the fare with our taxi driver before entering his cab, and he told us he would deposit us and wait, making a round trip. When we demurred, saying the cost would be prohibitive because he would be kept waiting a long time, he assured us it would be O.K. Expert that he was, he knew we would not be ''sightseeing'' in that gruesome place for too long. He was right. We stayed for less than 10 minutes.JUNE OLIANSKY Brooklyn
810	 2014	a	MELLON--Giles, of Brooklyn, New York and Lakeville, Connecticut died at home in Brooklyn just one year ago today at age 82. Giles was a husband, a father, a grandfather, a father-in-law, a brother-in-law, an uncle, a brother, a friend, and a colleague. His passions were deep: literature, history, music, art, and above all, his family. Giles's sense of play was ever present and so touching. A rare spirit with both a heart and intellect larger than life, Giles is missed and remembered every day. We all love him so deeply.

4407	 1993	a	Christopher Rouse's Trombone Concerto, which received its world premiere in a performance by Leonard Slatkin leading the New York Philharmonic on Wednesday night in Avery Fisher Hall, is an obsessive work. The trombone, an instrument typically associated with slides and energy and swing, with sudden moves and blasts, is here turned into an almost introspective isolate: lyrically mourning, then raging and mourning again. At the beginning, it sings a low, two-note sigh that is almost a groan. Slowly, as if through accumulated grief, that motif grows, supported by shimmers in the orchestra and given energy by roiling percussive thunder.The work is distinctive, unsettling, yet structurally clear. It was a Philharmonic commission for the orchestra's 150th anniversary and was given a stunningly virtuosic performance by Joseph Alessi, the principal trombonist.Given the occasion, it is suitable that the work bears the dedication "In memoriam Leonard Bernstein." Its three movements, played without pause, form a kind of elegy. It even quotes a theme from Bernstein's "Kaddish" Symphony, though Mr. Rouse's version of the "Kaddish" -- the Jewish prayer of mourning -- seems untempered by faith.Mr. Rouse has become one of the most-performed composers of his generation (he was born in 1949). His "Infernal Machine," "Gorgon" and other works have an almost animalistic energy, straining at the bounds of concert-hall manners. He has quoted Shostakovich in his music, but also Led Zeppelin. He has recently completed a cello concerto and is working on a flute concerto and a second symphony.

1130	 2012	a	SPOKANE, Wash. — Rick Santorum implied Thursday night that he had won the primary on Tuesday in Michigan, where he actually lost the popular vote to Mitt Romney and, as of now, is behind him in delegates.He did not mention the controversy over the delegates that had sprung up overnight after the Michigan Republican Party changed its rules and, instead of awarding an equal number of delegates to both candidates as expected, gave two additional delegates to Mr. Romney, who won the popular vote with 41 percent compared with Mr. Santorum’s 38 percent.The Santorum campaign on Thursday accused the state party of “thuggery” for changing the delegate rules after the election. It has asked the Republican National Committee to intervene.Mr. Santorum, speaking to a crowd of a few hundred people at a megachurch here in advance of the Washington caucuses on Saturday, said he had an equal number of delegates and implied that he had won Michigan — at least started winning after Feb. 7, when he won three other contests and voters in Michigan who were casting absentee ballots realized he could be elected. (He has offered no evidence to support that conclusion.)“From the time that we won Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri,” he said, “from that point on, we won the vote” in Michigan. “There were absentee ballots filed before that, but from that point on, we won the vote. Once people looked at our record and his record, once people looked at who was the fighter that’s going to go out and charge Washington and change Washington, the folks in Michigan voted for Rick Santorum. And we came out of Michigan with the same number of delegates as Governor Romney did – not bad in his home state.”The Santorum campaign had said on Wednesday that it expected to win half the 30 delegates in the state, which awards its delegates on a proportional basis by Congressional district. But on Wednesday night, the Michigan Republican Party’s Credentials Committee voted 4-to-2 to award two at-large delegates to Mr. Romney, giving him a 16-14 delegate advantage.On Feb. 4, the committee had approved a procedure that would have awarded the at-large delegates equally. But Saul Anuzis, the former state Republican chairman who is a member of the committee and supports Mr. Romney, said in a statement that a memo about how the delegates would be awarded contained an error.The committee’s intention, he said, was not to award the two at-large delegates proportionally but to give them both to the winner of the statewide popular vote: Mr. Romney.“While we all regret the error in the memo,” Mr. Anuzis said, “it does not change what was voted on by the committee, which was to award the two at-large delegates to the statewide winner.”Although he did not discuss that dispute during his half-hour speech here in Spokane, for which he was an hour late, the rule change seems to have added to his already palpable sense of grievance against the Republican establishment.In Iowa in January, Mr. Santorum actually won the caucuses, but because of miscounts, Mr. Romney was initially declared the winner. Mr. Santorum has said that not being perceived immediately as the winner and not being able to deliver a victory speech when so many people were watching had denied him subsequent momentum.On Thursday night, he portrayed himself as an insurgent candidate going up against the establishment, a David against Goliath.“We are running, we’re getting outspent everywhere by five, six, seven to one,” he said. “All the big-money guys, spending huge amounts of money, and anytime you punch back, oh, they get all upset. ‘Oh, he’s unfair. He called eligible voters and asked them to vote in Michigan.’ Wow.”Mr. Santorum was referring to his campaign’s urging of Democrats in Michigan to vote in the Republican primary, which some analysts bemoaned as mischievous but which Mr. Santorum defended.Mr. Romney was “out there telling lie after lie after lie,” Mr. Santorum said, without specifying what he meant, “and I went out and actually asked eligible voters to vote and that’s ‘unfair.’ ”“Folks, this is the establishment. They don’t like getting into the fight, they just like having the money advantage and having their way.”He planned one more rally in Washington State before heading back Friday to Ohio, the most important of the 10 states that vote on Super Tuesday next week.

4804	 1991	a	Mr. Dinkins is seeking concessions from city unions in an effort to avert some or all of the layoffs, and late last night city officials were considering a proposal from union leaders that would avert many layoffs through a wage deferral, an early-retirement program and stepped up attrition.City officials discounted the possiblity of an imminent agreement. Asked if he was optimistic, Barry Feinstein, the teamsters union leader, said: "It depends on what they come back with. All the elements for a solution are on the table."In reaching an agreement, Mr. Dinkins was forced to give way on tax increases that he had fought vigorously for over many weeks, and to embrace a budget that included service cuts he considered unthinkable only a few months ago.But at the same time, succeeding in putting together any kind of budget at all under such adverse circumstances could serve the Mayor well in the face of relentless questioning of his administration's ability to manage the city's affairs. And it also makes calls for a takeover of the city's finances by the state's Financial Control Board seem a far more distant possibility. Sweet Compromise for SomeFor the often maligned Council, the compromise was sweet. By fighting both for lower taxes and fewer service cuts, Council members gained political capital to use in the November elections. And by dropping plans to pass their own budget -- after establishing it as a credible threat -- they avoided the risks of a prolonged fight with the Mayor.The budget agreement came so late, that negotiators said it would take most of the night to fill in all the details and most of today to print the budget, delaying the adoption until tonight at the earliest. Some Council aides said the delay was the longest in at least several decades.But with the city's fiscal problems so severe, many officials were predicting that whatever budget was put into place now would soon change to take into account concessions from municipal unions or the further decline in the city's fiscal picture forecast by the City Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman.

4861	 1991	a	Moody's Investors Service assigned a B2 rating yesterday to the preferred equity redemption culmulative stock, or Percs, of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation, and it placed the $1.9 billion issue on its review list with the possibility of an upgrade.The Standard & Poor's Corporation, meanwhile, gave the issue a BB- rating and also said it would consider an upgrade.Moody's said the Percs had "strong equity characteristics," and noted that RJR Nabisco had stated that it hoped to exchange common stock for preferred.Moody's also said it wondered whether "this infusion of equity represents an enduring change in the orientation towards financial risk on the part of RJR Nabisco's management." RJR Nabisco has a large amount of high-interest debt outstanding.
3613	 1998	a	To the Editor:Re ''Just Refinanced That Mortgage? Maybe It's Time to Do It Again'' (Spending It, Jan. 18):A worksheet accompanying the article looked at the time needed to recover the costs of refinancing a home mortgage. But it left out three important factors that lengthen that period and can thus make refinancing look less desirable:* The tax deductibility of interest payments. Say that a refinancing reduces your total mortgage payments from $25,000 a year to $23,000. That doesn't mean you've saved $2,000. When interest payments are reduced, your tax deductions are also reduced. If your marginal tax rate -- Federal, state and city -- is 40 percent, your after-tax savings in this case will be closer to $1,200.* The cost of losing the use of your money. Say you pay $3,000 in closing costs on this same refinancing. If you had instead put that money in a bank account, where it earned just 2.5 percent interest after taxes, you would reap an additional $75 a year. That money should also be subtracted from your potential savings from refinancing.* The cost of your time. It takes many hours to gather financial records, complete the application forms for the refinancing and attend the closing -- typically held during business hours.An accurate calculation of the potential savings from refinancing depends on a borrower's tax bracket and the age of the existing loan. Only if all relevant factors are considered can a borrower determine whether refinancing makes any sense for him.

4385	 1994	a	In 1926, when he was 12 years old, he walked into a Washington bookstore with his parents, dipped into Crowe and Cavalcaselle's "North Italian Painting" and was never the same again.He did not have, and never sought, any formal training in art history. But at Downside, a Benedictine school in England, he pursued his newfound vocation in every spare moment. Later he had a rigorous training as a political and intellectual historian at Balliol College, Oxford.After graduating in 1935, he sold some islands off Borneo that had been bequeathed to him by an uncle and spent the money on two years of private art-history study in Europe.He traveled, he looked, he thought and he wrote. He also listened to senior art historians, many of them refugees from Nazi Germany, and learned much from their methodology, their standards of interpretation and their sometimes hilarious quirks. He could also characterize them in just a few words, as when he referred to the "gentle, dogmatic, unpersuasive voice" of an art historian who aspired to mate Marxism with 15th-century Italian art.A new challenge always amused him. When appointed to the staff of the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1938, he applied himself with memorable effect to the study of English portrait miniatures, whose distinction was underrated at the time.After five years' service in air-force intelligence during World War II, he returned to Europe in 1944. Never a blinkered specialist, he was one of the first Englishmen to report in print on recent work of Matisse and Picasso in the Salon d'Automne in liberated Paris.When he rejoined the Victoria and Albert Museum, he stipulated that he be assigned to a department of which he knew nothing. Many years later, he spoke almost with nostalgia of the ramified obligations that had come his way in great miscellaneous museums, where he had had to deal with "everything from Victorian brass lecterns to filthy plastic bags full of the mummies of Peruvian children."

The play, written by the Italian playwright Stefano Massini and adapted by Ben Power, also appeared recently in the West End and was staged several years ago in Paris and Milan.“The Lehman Trilogy” has lined up an award-winning creative team, including the director Sam Mendes, who won a Tony Award this year for his direction of “The Ferryman,” and the costume designer Katrina Lindsay, who has won two Tony Awards.Producing the show are the National Theater, behind several recent Broadway hits including “Network” and “Angels in America,” and Mr. Mendes’s Neal Street Productions, whose “The Ferryman” won this year’s Tony Award for best play. Scott Rudin, Barry Diller and David Geffen will also produce.The Nederlander was previously home to “Pretty Woman,” which closed in August. Harry Connick Jr. will begin performances of his ode to Cole Porter in December at the theater before embarking on a national tour.

195	 2018	a	Until Wednesday night, Donald Trump and people in his orbit insisted that the president had known nothing about the $130,000 hush money payment to the pornographic film star Stormy Daniels made by his lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, days before the 2016 election. Last month on Air Force One, a reporter asked Trump about it directly: “Did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels?” His response was a categorical no.This denial was always implausible, and now we have new evidence that Trump was lying. On Wednesday evening, Rudy Giuliani, whose appointment to Trump’s legal team was announced two weeks ago, appeared on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show and casually admitted that Trump had repaid Cohen for the money he gave to Daniels “over a period of several months.”This was a bombshell. And in the 12 hours that followed, both Trump and Giuliani made a series of statements so seemingly self-sabotaging and undisciplined that observers began searching for some sort of hidden strategy or logic. Were they trying to get out ahead of a coming revelation? To set off a metaphorical smoke bomb that would distract from some other scandalous development? Or were they really as blundering and incompetent as they appeared?I suspect the answer is a combination of the three. But their motivations are less important than the information they’ve provided us. Whether they realize it or not, experts say they appear to have admitted that Trump and Cohen broke the law. The question is whether the impunity that Trump has enjoyed so far will hold or whether this farce of a presidency will, at long last, begin to crumble under the weight of its own sleaze.
6120	 1977	a	October sales among six of New York City's biggest retailers rose only moderately over the month a year ago, the gains, averaging 4.5 percent, just about matching the inflation rate in department‐store merchandise.Warmer weather than in the 1976 month kept October's sales from rising more, according to industry experts, adversely affecting consumer interest in cold‐weather apparel, particularly coats and other outerwear.Also, the October business compared with a particularly strong 1976 month, when sales were the strongest of the year. Sales in New York City had risen 8.6 percent in October 1976, in great part aided by extremely cold weather.City Gains Exceed RegionsAlthough last month's retail volume in the city was generally not strong, the gain again topped the trend in the greater metropolitan area, indicating that suburban stores were not doing as well as those in the city. Sales among stores in the area rose only 2.4 percent over last year, a spot‐check found.
1944	 2008	a	My neighbors and I are very unhappy with both our co-op board and the management company. We can boot the board at the next annual meeting, but none of us concerned shareholders know how to go about changing the company who manages the building. Who even decides on this — just the board or all of the shareholders? It has not been discussed at previous annual meetings.“By law, the business of a corporation is to be managed under the direction of the board of directors,” said Howard Schechter, a Manhattan lawyer who represents co-ops and condominiums. “This means that only the board can choose to hire a managing agent or to fire one.”So, Mr. Schechter said, the first step for the letter writer is to make sure that the unhappy shareholders have enough votes at the annual meeting to elect a new board. “This includes choosing candidates to run, making themselves and their dissatisfactions known to the other shareholders, and urging like-minded shareholders to attend the meeting or sign proxies that can be voted for the dissident slate,” he said.The challenging shareholders should also check the bylaws to determine the termination provisions of the management contract. “Most management contracts include a clause that allows the board to end the contract on 30 or 60 days’ notice,” he said.Such notice should not be given until a new managing agent has been identified and a new management contract has been negotiated. “The ability of the agent to meet the cooperative’s needs should always be the No. 1 concern,” he said.

4014	 1996	a	Fred Anderson, a television and radio newsman in Los Angeles for many years, died on June 23 at Glendale Memorial Hospital and Health Center, where he had undergone triple bypass surgery two days earlier. He had apparently suffered a heart attack the previous weekend, according to KABC-TV. He was 59.Mr. Anderson had been with KABC-TV since 1969. He specialized in human-interest features in a series titled "Good News," which was broadcast during the 1980's. His work at KABC-TV included a series in which he tried out more than 500 occupations, from teacher and blimp pilot to deckhand and actor.Mr. Anderson was born in Worcester, Mass. He studied music, but decided on a career in journalism. He worked for United Press International in Roanoke, Va., where he also worked as a radio reporter and news director. He was a radio news director at WJBW in New Orleans before moving to Los Angeles. His awards included an Emmy for a documentary on battered children.He is survived by his parents, Fred and Edna, of Tampa, Fla.; a sister, Elaine Moore of Raleigh, N.C.; a brother, Calvin, of Massachusetts, and three daughters.
5223	 1988	a	Ever so quietly, senior officials of the International Olympic Committee are still working on resolving the issue of North Korea's participation in the Seoul Olympics later this year.At a recent state dinner in Madrid, Juan Antonio Samaranch, the I.O.C. president, spoke privately with Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet Foreign Minister, to review the I.O.C.'s position and to seek any help the Soviet Union might offer in persuading North Korea to attend the games.In June, the I.O.C. offered the North Koreans five events to stage. Last month, Pyongyang responded by saying North Korea would not participate in the Games unless it was made a co-host with South Korea. North Korea thus became one of 6 of the 167 nations to respond negatively to the I.O.C.'s invitation to take part in the Summer Games.A source familar with Samaranch's conversation with Shevardnadze said the Foreign Minister seemed surprised to hear that North Korea would not take the I.O.C. offer.

3333	 2000	a	And in Ms. Richardson's third-grade class, Jelahn Wilson, 8, said the summer was ''not very long but it seemed fun.''''I went on a trip to the Big Apple to see 'Beauty and the Beast,' and a trip to Funtime America,'' his essay began, then veered suddenly into the future tense to make up for the paucity of material. ''But next summer I think I am going to go to Jamaica with my grandmother because she needs help and. . . . ''Under provisions of the state law that authorized New Jersey's publicly financed charter schools, the 46 such schools now in operation have more flexibility in programming, structure, setting and curriculum than other public schools. And three years ago, when the founders of Robert Treat Academy looked at the traditional school calendar, they saw a holdover from an agrarian time that had little to do with urban America and even less to do with the needs of Newark's children.''We found out that we needed 25 percent more time in the day, and so we run from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.,'' said Stephen N. Adubato, one of the guiding forces behind the academy's creation and the executive director of the North Ward Center, a publicly financed social services agency in this mostly Italian and Hispanic neighborhood. ''And we found that we didn't need to have the kids out there hanging out in these dirty streets. They need structure, and this charter school is a lab with a license to innovate and test those things.''Experts on the charter school movement, as well as those involved in the public debates over the extended school year, suggest that longer school days and years are unlikely to catch on at other public schools. For one thing, many charter schools are viewed as elitist, and as hostile competitors with other public schools for the best students. And the scheduling flexibility the charter schools enjoy reflects their freedom from the contract requirements and benefits that teachers' unions have worked hard to achieve and protect. (The unions and the New Jersey Department of Education have agreed to let the Legislature approve such flexibility, as long as the number of charter schools is limited.)
2466	 2005	a	A Florida investor is seeking to block a $195 million preliminary settlement between tax shelter investors and KPMG, and to disqualify the settlement's lawyers over what he calls a major conflict of interest.The investor, Mark Kottler of Boca Raton, Fla., argued in a brief filed in federal court in Newark on Thursday that lawyers at Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman negotiated the settlement on behalf of separate plaintiffs in a class action against KPMG.According to the brief, those "secret negotiations," which Mr. Kottler said he was never informed of, compromised a separate lawsuit filed on Mr. Kottler's behalf by Milberg Weiss against KPMG in a Florida state court in early 2004 on the same abusive tax shelters.Melvyn Weiss of Milberg Weiss said yesterday that his firm "would vigorously oppose their seeking to stay our settlement."

3066	 2001	a	The United States economy grew at its slowest rate in more than five years during the final quarter of 2000, as businesses abruptly cut their spending on new equipment, the government said yesterday.American consumers continued to increase their purchases, albeit more slowly than earlier in the year, allowing the gross domestic product to grow at an annual pace of 1.4 percent during the quarter. Government spending, particularly on the military, also rose, while economic weakness around the globe caused foreign countries to trim their purchases of American goods.The Commerce Department's quarterly report depicted the $10.1 trillion United States economy verging on a slowdown or a recession. Growth remained faster than it had been in the first half of 1995, when the country avoided a recession and the economy then entered one of its best five-year periods in history.But over the final three months of 2000, personal consumption was the only part of the private sector that expanded, and in the early weeks of this year consumer confidence has plummeted, according to two major surveys.
6092	 1977	a	WASHINGTON, Sept. 1—A controversial study that paints a bleak portrait of United States defenses has emerged as the focus of an emotional debate involving Congress and the Pentagon.The study, by John M. Collins, senior specialist in national defense with the Library of Congress's Congressional Research Service, says that quantitative changes in American and Soviet armed forces favor the Soviet Union, with scattered exceptions. The document also contends that American intercontinental missiles are increasingly vulnerable to Soviet attack.Attention has been focused on the report as a result of recent allegations in Congress that the document had been “suppressed” because it conflicts with the generally optimistic Administration view of the United States ‐Soviet military balance. The study was placed in the Congressional Record last month by Senator Jesse A. Helms, Republican of North Carolina.Work to Be ReviewedSince then, Mr. Collins, a retired army colonel and specialist in strategic and tactical planning, has been denied a pay increase that he was scheduled to receive and warned that his work is not up to acceptable levels of competence. Mr. Collins has also been informed that his future work must be reviewed by a group of designated peers.

2306	 2006	a	A botched joke turned into a second day story today as Democrats fighting for re-election responded to the “John Kerry-insulted-our-troops saga.” And the blogs were right there to take notes.Harold Ford, Jr., the Democratic Senatorial candidate in Tennessee, said that Mr. Kerry, “whatever the intent,” should apologize for any insult he may have caused, which Mr. Kerry later did.The Tennessee based Volunteer Voters said that Mr. Kerry’s words put Mr. Ford in a difficult spot.“I don’t think the comment was a big deal,” the site said, “and his explanation of a fumbled joke is plausible. However, in terms of public perception it is disasterous (sic). Ford had no choice but to denounce it.”In Pennsylvania, Mr. Kerry canceled an appearance with another Democratic candidate for Senator, Bob Casey. Mr. Casey did not ask Mr. Kerry to apologize and, like Mr. Kerry himself, used the issue to criticize the Republican handling of the war in Iraq.PennPatriot, a conservative site, said that Mr. Casey’s refusal to condemn Mr. Kerry “just goes to show you that the Democratic Party wants political power so bad even their candidates, like Bob Casey, are willing to say or do anything to get elected.”In Virginia, Jim Webb, the Democratic challenger facing a tight race against Senator George Allen, said, “If that’s John Kerry’s idea of a joke, he needs to work on his punch line. But at the same time this administration has to accept the realities of failed strategic policy.”The Richmond Democrat blog thought that Tuesday may not be the only Election Day on which Mr. Kerry’s feels the effect of his mishandled joke.“I think Kerry recognizes how bad his stumble was – he’s dropped off the campaign trail for this year,” allowing his competitors for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2008 “to go out and campaign for fellow Democrats and rack up support while he has to sit on the bench.”
5548	 1986	a	Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth yesterday suspended for one year Keith Hernandez of the Mets, Dale Berra of the Yankees and five other major league players for cocaine use. However, Mr. Ueberroth offered to lift the suspensions if the players agreed to certain conditions, including contributing 10 percent of their salaries this year to programs to combat drug abuse and submitting to drug tests for the remainder of their careers.Four other players were suspended for 60 days, with the bans to be lifted if they give 5 percent of their salaries to drug programs and agree to testing.The commissioner also said he would require 10 other players to undergo testing for the remainder of their careers because of past use of cocaine. These 10 are not to be penalized. Reason for Suspensions Any of the players involved who have positive tests for cocaine, marijuana, morphine or heroin would automatically be subject to the suspension, Mr. Ueberroth said. Similarly, those who refuse to be tested would be subject to the suspensions, which would be effective opening day. Those suspended would not be paid.The one-year suspensions were handed out to those players who Mr. Ueberroth said had not only used drugs themselves but had also ''in some fashion facilitated the distribution of drugs in baseball.'' He said these players had shared drugs with teammates and in some cases introduced players to drug dealers.

1477	 2010	a	Home Fires features the writing of men and women who have returned from wartime service in the United States military.This is the first in a five-part series, “Retelling the War,” in which veterans discuss how books, movies and other tales of combat shaped their perceptions of themselves and of war.In the spring and summer of 2003, I participated in Operation Iraqi Freedom as an infantry squad leader with Weapons Company, 25th Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Division. I was 23 years old. Being a Marine deployed to the combat zone was something I had dreamed of since childhood. In high school, while other kids studied basketball statistics, I knew off hand the performance characteristics of nearly every major weapons system fielded.I grew up in Brooklyn, emigrating with my parents from the Caribbean in 1985. My family does not have a history of military service, so my fascination did not begin there; instead, one of my earliest memories is of seeing a Marine Security Guard standing at parade rest in front of the Barbadian embassy. He was sharp — in my mind, I still see the shine of his shoes, the crispness of the creases in his uniform. This image resonated for reasons unknown to me, but at the age of four, I knew that I would one day wear the same uniform.As a child, I was studious; I read a lot. My father bought the family an encyclopedia and I spent most of my youth reading it. The encyclopedia sparked my curiosity. The pages came alive with pictures and words — aardvarks to Army, I devoured the content and it inspired me to focus my reading on topics that truly interested me. By high school, I was reading almost exclusively about Vietnam. As a teenager, I was not interested in politics. I understood the theory of domino effect, had seen the Berlin wall come down, could remember Tiananmen Square, but what drew me into reading about Vietnam in particular were the powerful personal narratives of the men and women who had fought there.I read the “Rogue Warrior” series by Richard (“Dick”) Marcinko. For a young man intent on joining the military, the adventure of combat in the Mekong Delta was intoxicating. The candid writing of Mr. Marcinko, mixed with moments of humor and friendship, helped to further my interest. I followed his writing the way other kids followed athletes and musicians.I felt a certain amount of shame for what I thought of as an easy war, skating or getting away easy in comparison to others.In addition to Vietnam, I became intensely interested in Marine Corps history. I studied the advance through the Pacific, the battles at Chosin and Hue, read and watched everything that I could get my hands on about the Corps. From these books, the romanticism of war — of being a warrior — began to take root within me and culminated with my decision to enlist at age 17.On April 4, 2003, my unit received our warning order. We were to fly into the city of Nasiriya and provide mortar fire in support of sister units fighting to capture a bridge. By this time, I had spent my entire adult life in the Marine Corps, but still hadn’t seen combat. I thought that the dullness of sitting in the Kuwaiti desert would now finally be worth it. The dozens of field exercises, the desert training, the cold weather nightmare training, the fatiguing high altitude training, all of the invested time would be worth it. The collective weight of 228 years of history, the warrior ethos of Always Faithful, the few, the proud, the Marines, all of it made sense that April night in Kuwait.We were to fly into Nasiriya and join the battle, but at the last moment our orders were updated and instead, we were directed to drive from Kuwait to Nasiriya. The unit didn’t need our cover after all. This news was somewhat disappointing: I was relieved that the other Marines were able to secure the objective, but I felt frustrated for not having been a part of the struggle.My unit spent approximately five months in country. Our time there was filled with huge swaths of mind-numbing boredom punctuated by sporadic moments of extreme intensity. On at least two occasions our compound came under attack — once my squad was ambushed — but we all survived. Iraq was not at all the war that I expected. The majority of time was spent either on post or on patrol, looking for an enemy, who at that time was reluctant to fight us.Related Maurice Decaul in One in 8 Million Learn more about the writer in One in 8 Million, a collection of stories by New Yorkers in sights and sounds. Listen to the Writer’s Story »I came home from the experience carrying a solemn feeling of disappointment, and guilt. It was difficult for me to reconcile my mild experience, or what I felt to be a mild experience, with what I knew others had faced. For many years I tried to minimize my wartime experience. When someone asked, I would almost always answer that it was no big deal or that it was fine. Looking back, I believe now that this was just a reflex. I felt a certain amount of shame for what I thought of as an easy war, skating or getting away easy in comparison to others. The reflex developed as a way of deflating further conversation about the war, and for the most part, it worked.Since February 2009, I have attended a writing workshop for veterans at New York University. The workshop is intended for veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan to meet, write and share their stories, if they choose. At the workshop, I began to write poetry. Poetry felt right. Here for the first time I felt comfortable sharing my experience. Through the writing and the sense of community engendered by the workshop, I began to re-evaluate my war experience. I came to find the value in it, the good work that we did in Iraq and for the people of Iraq. I came to appreciate my time in the service, not just in Iraq, but in general. I had done exactly what I’d dreamed of doing from the time in Barbados when I saw the Marine Security Guard.Writing has different meanings for each of us. Though I am somewhat reluctant to call it catharsis, in some ways it is. It has helped me move past the books and movies that had shaped my ideas of warfare. I had taken control of the narrative. I was telling the story on my own terms and I was telling it for real.This process continues to provide me with a way to manage my emotional stress about my service. Through writing and rewriting Iraq, I have managed to move away from the feelings of guilt, disappointment and shame. I write now not just to exorcise tension, but because I love to write. Really, I need to write.Maurice Decaul served in the Marine Corps for nearly five years.

335	 2017	a	LOS ANGELES — “Victory!!!”With that single aggressively punctuated tweet, Phillip Iscove, a creator of the Fox drama “Sleepy Hollow,” summed up what Hollywood writers seemed to be feeling on Tuesday, after a middle-of-the night deal between studios and writers to avert a strike.Conspicuously not doing a victory lap was the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of studios.A tentative agreement for a new three-year, master contract with the producers’ alliance and unions representing more than 12,000 television and movie writers was reached at around 1 a.m. on the West Coast. The previous contract expired at midnight, and the Writers Guild of America, West, and the Writers Guild of America, East, had vowed to go on strike as early as Tuesday morning. A walkout would have immediately sent late-night comedy shows into reruns and threatened important presentations planned by ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC to attract advertising.The unions declared in an email to members that they had won “unprecedented gains.” Leaders added: “Did we get everything we wanted? No. Everything we deserve? Certainly not. But because we had the near-unanimous backing of you and your fellow writers, we were able to achieve a deal that will net this guild’s members $130 million more, over the life of the contract, than the pattern we were expected to accept.”

2749	 2003	a	Jolted by tumbling stock prices and the economic fallout from the SARS virus, the Bank of Japan's monetary policy board said today that it would flood the markets with yet more cash and expand the range of collateral that it accepts for loans.The moves are the latest in a series of incremental steps taken by the central bank's new governor, Toshihiko Fukui, who took office in mid-March. The measures are unlikely to provide any significant stimulus to the economy or relief to the nation's struggling banks, but Mr. Fukui is under pressure from the government to find ways to help halt the long slide in Japanese asset prices.Unlike his predecessor, Masaru Hayami, who resisted direct pressure from the government, Mr. Fukui has agreed to cooperate with lawmakers as much as he can. To that end, the central bank said today that it would begin accepting bank loans that had been turned over to the government-backed Industrial Revitalization Corporation as collateral for new lending. The decision is meant to prod the country's banks to sell their troubled loans to this new organization.More immediately, policy makers are fearful that further declines in the stock market will weaken Japan's banks, which count some of their immense shareholdings as capital. Typically, the central bank tries to avoid creating the appearance that it is reacting to short-term market moves. But in an unusually blunt statement, the bank's policy board said today, ''Careful attention is warranted so that the stock price developments will not negatively affect financial markets and economic activity.''

5078	 1989	a	BAKING with flour is not the microwave oven's best trick, nor is browning. But when you want to do one or both of these things, the microwave oven can be a great aid in preparation that would otherwise take more time or be more annoying. The filling for a lemon-orange meringue pie can be made in the microwave oven. The crust is conventionally baked and the meringue is once again browned under the broiler. The lemon curd is easy to make in a microwave oven and does not scorch. It also contains no gelatin. It can be made ahead of time and left to chill overnight. The crust can also be baked ahead of time. For a nice variation, add orange sections and orange zest. Lemon-Orange Meringue Pie Preparation time: 30 minutes, plus time for making lemon curd and chilling crust Cooking time: 25 minutes 2 cups lemon curd (see recipe) 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour 2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 3 ounces cold lard 3 ounces chilled unsalted butter, cut into small pieces 3 tablespoons cold water 1/4 cup orange marmalade 2 juice oranges, optional 4 egg whites pinch cream of tartar pinch kosher salt 1/4 cup granulated sugar.1.Make lemon curd and place in the refrigerator to chill while finishing recipe.2.To make the crust, sift together flour and salt in the large bowl of an electric mixer. Add lard and butter and mix with a paddle until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add cold water and mix only until dough forms a ball. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for one hour.3.Roll out pastry or press it into a 9-inch glass pie plate. Prick bottom all over with a fork. Line with baking parchment or aluminum foil and weight with beans or pie weights. Chill for 15 minutes.4.Preheat conventional oven to 425 degrees.5.Place crust in oven and bake for 10 minutes or until edges are set. Remove beans and parchment and continue baking for 10 more minutes or until golden brown. Remove from oven.

7437	 1964	a	The Superintendent's announcement was made within hours after the Board of Education, whose members have been critical of Dr. Gross issued a statement calling upon the Surecommendations to improve education.The one‐sentence statement said:“The Board of Education, in accordance with its continually expressed desire to improve the degree of quality education in underprivileged areas, has requested the Superintendent of Schools to present to the board prior to the opening of school in September, 1964, a realistic and feasible plan whereby there can be assured for the future a greater number of more experienced teachers and supervisors in those schools especially requirihg the services of such staff personnel and further that, to the extent feasible, the implementation of such a plan commence with the opening of school in September, 1964.”The board members have in the past privately criticized Dr. Gross for not exerting leadership and for failing to submit concrete plans for action.Asked whether there was any connection between the board's statement and the announcement by Dr. Gross, a spokesman for the school system replied that “it was just a coincidence.”Dr. Gross later issued the following comment: “Better staffing of schools in disadvantaged areas has been a goal of the school system for a long time. It is unquestionably an urgent problem. The staff and I have been at work at it right along. The present situation calls for every possible bit of speed that can result in real and lasting improvement in the classrooms.

4964	 1990	a	Gertrud Michelson's ''When a Child Walks Away,'' [Opinion Page, June 10] evoked a sad nostalgia as I recalled a similar experience not many years after the author's.I was a little older than Gertrud back in the 40's when I ''ran away'' - about 11 years of age. And my trip took me much farther - from Philadelphia to New York.My mother was visiting her mother in New York and I became angry at my father who was home with my brother and me. I raided my bank (public transportation was very reasonable in those days!) and set off by trolley car (a natural means of transportation for an 11-year-old then) for Pennsylvania Station in Philadelphia. In looking back, I wonder why I was not questioned at the ticket window; I purchased my ticket and made the trip uneventfully to New York.From there, it was just a non-threatening subway ride to 96th and Central Park West and a three-block walk to my grandmother's house - where I was welcomed by a near-hysterical mother and grandmother, because my father had called frantically to report my disappearance.

2864	 2003	a	FINDING a notice from the Internal Revenue Service in the mail is enough to ruin the day for many people, and the ensuing headache can last for weeks or months, as a taxpayer deals with clerk after clerk trying to get the information needed to resolve the issue. Next year, though, the ordeal will be much briefer for millions of taxpayers who rely on professionals to prepare their tax returns.Perhaps before spring, tax professionals will be able to go online and get the information needed to resolve many problems in minutes, said Terence H. Lutes, the I.R.S. director for electronic tax administration.For taxpayers, speeding the resolution of disputes should mean lower fees to their tax advisers, as well as less anxiety. In many cases, Mr. Lutes said, the cost to the I.R.S. of resolving a problem will drop to pennies from tens of dollars.The I.R.S. is testing a system called Electronic Account Resolution with a handful of tax professionals. Lawyers, accountants and enrolled agents -- a kind of preparer who is authorized to represent taxpayers before the I.R.S. -- will be able to use the system; they can go online now to register. But individuals and other paid preparers will not have access.

1140	 2012	a	An unexpected issue in the 2012 election is whether or not rank-and-file Americans should aspire to a college degree. Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum have both made comments about higher education that could come back to haunt them in a general election.“President Obama once said he wants everybody in America to go to college. What a snob,” Santorum told a Tea Party meeting in Troy, Mich., on Feb. 25. “I understand why he wants you to go to college. He wants to remake you in his image.”Romney, the all-but-certain nominee, was blunt when speaking in March at a metal assembly plant in Youngstown, Ohio: “It would be popular for me to stand up and say I’m going to give you government money to pay for your college, but I’m not going to promise that.”There is a partisan logic to the Republican hostility to higher education: the well-educated — a reliable source of conservative support as recently as the 1980s — have been moving steadily toward the Democratic Party. In a head-to-head contest, a March 26 McClatchy-Marist Poll shows Romney ahead of Obama 47-42 among those without college degrees, while Obama leads Romney 51-42 among those with them. Similarly, those without college degrees lean toward voting for Republican congressional candidates 49-40, while those with them lean toward Democrats 46-44.Not only are Democrats making gains among the better-educated, but these voters are becoming a larger share of the electorate. Exit polls show the growth of the college-educated voting bloc.In 1984, those with college and advanced degrees made up 35.3 percent of the electorate. Reagan’s strongest margins were among the college educated, who backed him over Walter F. Mondale by a crushing 62.7-36.9 margin. Among all those with both college and advanced degrees, Reagan won 58.7 percent, a landslide margin.Jump to 2008. Even though those with college degrees made up 27.9 percent of the population that year, they cast 45 percent of the presidential vote. These voters register and go to the polls in substantially higher numbers than the less well educated.By 2008, the Republican advantage of the early 1980s among voters with a college degree or higher had disappeared. Barack Obama carried this demographic with 54.1 percent. He beat McCain 50-48 among those with bachelor’s degrees, and by a decisive 58-40 among the 17 percent of the 2008 electorate with post-graduate degrees.The shifting allegiance of the better-educated – together with the growth of such pro-Democratic constituencies as single women, Hispanics and African-Americans — has been a crucial factor in the revival of the Democratic Party as a fully competitive force in presidential elections. The party’s gains have, in many respects, made up for losses among white working class voters.In the 1970s and 1980s, the defection of Reagan Democrats gave the Republican Party a clear edge in national contests; by the 1990s and 2000s, the once reliably Republican affluent suburbs surrounding cities like New York and Philadelphia had moved in the opposite direction, empowering the Democratic Party to win the White House in 1992, 1996, and 2008, and the popular vote, if not the presidency, in 2000. By contrast, in the 1970s and 1980s, Republican presidential candidates won, on average, 59 percent of the upscale suburban vote.The gains the Democrats made were concentrated in one major segment of the well-educated: professionals — salaried employees in schools and colleges, social workers, the arts, the natural and social sciences, knowledge/information workers, “symbol analysts,” “creatives” and so forth.Andrew Gelman, director of the Applied Statistics Center at Columbia University, has illustrated the voting trends among different job classifications in his book “Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State: Why Americans Vote the Way They Do.”The graph below shows how professionals voted compared to the entire electorate.courtesy of Andrew GelmanAt the same time, the percentage of the population employed in professional jobs has been growing steadily, from 16.4 percent of the workforce in 1970 to 22.2 percent in 2010.While Democratic gains among those with undergraduate and advanced degrees have clearly benefitted the party, there are costs.The replacement of working-class whites with upscale professionals has turned the Democratic coalition into an alliance with a built-in class division. Instead of representing the bottom half of the income distribution as it did from the 1930s to the 1960s, the party has become bifurcated, with roughly 60 percent of the base vote cast by relatively poor and heavily minority voters, and much of the remainder provided by relatively affluent social and cultural liberals.While constituting a minority, the relatively upscale wing clearly dominates party policy and provides the majority of the activists who run campaigns, serve as delegates to the convention and have become the core of the party’s donor base.The leverage of the highly-educated wing is reflected in the priority placed on the culture war issues that are of key importance to this wing. Support for abortion rights and gay rights, for example, is an essential litmus test for Democratic presidential candidates. There is no parallel demand that candidates protect and expand food stamps, Medicaid, or other means-tested programs for the poor.On the Republican side of the aisle, the aversion to federally funded scholarship aid – as demonstrated, for example, in the budget passed last week by the Republican House — has significant consequences for the party’s core supporters.The children of the white working class are in need of financial support to pay for tuition at a two or four-year colleges as a path to upward mobility. The overwhelming majority of Pell Grants, 63.3 percent, go to low income whites, while 11.8 percent goes to African-American students, 13.2 percent to Hispanics, 6.8 percent to Asian-Americans, and the rest to other groups.This year, Romney will need to win by a wide margin among those for whom access to post-secondary education is a key issue — particularly white men whose wages have stagnated or eroded more than those of women.The following chart, put together by the M.I.T. economists Daron Acemoglu and David Autor, shows what has happened to the wages of men with various levels of education working full time (high school dropout, high school graduate, some college, college graduate, greater than college).courtesy of David AutorFor men without college degrees, 1972-3 marked — in economic terms — the best year of their lives, and earnings adjusted for inflation have gone downhill over the forty years since then. Only men with college degrees, and especially those with post-graduate degrees, did better in 2008 than they had in 1973.A central theme of the Romney campaign is that he intends to replace the Democratic “entitlement state” with the restoration of America as “a land of opportunity and a beacon of freedom.”In the fight for Republican primary votes, it may make political sense for Santorum to mock higher education as the province of liberal elitists and for Romney to display deficit-consciousness by declaring his opposition to government assistance for college tuition.In the general election, Romney faces a far tougher sell. Federal aid to education has strong, bipartisan support among voters, with more than 60 percent of Republicans and Democrats opposed to making any cuts, according to a Gallup poll from Jan. 26, 2011.Romney’s refusal to promise that he will “give you government money to pay for your college” is a risky approach to courting ambitious lower income voters. Democrats see Romney setting a trap for himself and have already begun to lay the general election groundwork.The increasing salience of education provides Democrats with an effective means of countering the problem of an underperforming economy, as President Obama demonstrated in a speech on Feb. 27: “We can’t allow higher education to be a luxury in this country. It’s an economic imperative that every family in America has to be able to afford.”Romney, in turn, appears to recognize that he has stepped onto treacherous terrain. His Web site now declares: “Post-secondary education cannot become a luxury for the few; instead, all students should have the opportunity to attend a college that best suits their needs. Whether it is public or private, traditional or online, college must be available and affordable.”Still, Romney does not specify which actions he would have the federal government take to prevent post-secondary education from becoming a luxury for the few. Instead, his Web site trumpets the potential for initiatives at the state level, where Romney, speaking as a former governor himself, “knows what can be accomplished when governors are empowered to reform their education systems.”Thomas B. Edsall, a professor of journalism at Columbia University, is the author of the book “The Age of Austerity: How Scarcity Will Remake American Politics,” which was published in January.

5661	 1985	a	President Reagan's meeting this week with Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone of Japan, like his recent meetings with the leaders of West Germany and Britain, looks to be little more than a courtesy visit. That's too bad, because there's serious business waiting to be done.When he was asked the other day if he would press Mr. Nakasone to be more hospitable to American goods and correct a growing trade imbalance, Mr. Reagan replied: ''How can I get tough with a very good friend?'' Nor was this merely a polite cover story; the meeting in Los Angeles is to last less than three hours, including lunch. But if they won't talk firmly now, when?Japan's trade with the United States is disturbingly unbalanced. Japanese exporters in 1984 sold Americans wares worth $35 billion more than those sold by Americans in Japan. That's more than a quarter of America's worrisome worldwide trade deficit. The gap need not be closed, but it has to be narrowed.What's likely in 1985, however, is that it will widen. In part, that's because of the faster growth of the American economy, sucking in still more imports from all over. But both Governments deserve blame for not doing enough to correct the imbalance.
1778	 2009	a	To the Editor:Re “Christopher Wheeldon, Unbowed” by Roslyn Sulcas [Oct. 25]:In her feature on Christopher Wheeldon, Ms. Sulcas suggests that “the health of the dance scene and the cultural world in New York” may be in jeopardy if Wheeldon “can’t attract the financing and support for his work.”Surely not.

If taken seriously, Mr. Wheeldon’s comment that ballet need not be “a big, puffy, pink, glittery nightmare” is insulting to his colleagues and his forbears.James ClouserTucson

3652	 1998	a	To the Editor:Stephen J. Gould (Op-Ed, May 29) argues that a biological window on human behavior provides little help in the search for sensible political structures. He thus must either believe that biology tells us little about human behavior or that human behavior does not much constrain our politics. But he cannot believe the first without rejecting the main proposition of Darwinism that man is an animal shaped by natural selection. He cannot believe the second without rejecting political philosophers like James Madison, who rested his support for the Constitution on his analysis of human nature.Mr. Gould's view that the biology of sexuality and aging is largely irrelevant to politics makes one wonder what he would consider in making social policy. For example, if sexuality is such a powerful urge that men often do not think through its consequences, the absence of institutions like child support will allow them to transfer the costs of their acts to society.JOHN O. MCGINNISTurin, Italy, May 29, 1998

2996	 2002	a	ITT Industries, which has its corporate headquarters in White Plains, announced last week that it won an $8.3 million contract from the U.S. Army to develop sensors for detecting chemical and biological weapons.The electro-optical sensors can detect and identify chemical weapon agents on surfaces. They are being designed primarily for military use, but can also detect chemicals inside buildings and at airports, in luggage and cargo, and by law enforcement and first responder units to identify chemical threats.They would be mounted on military vehicles to be sent out before vehicles carrying troops. The company is making the prototypes in labs in Albuquerque, N.M.ITT, which manufactures electronic components, calls its system the Laser Interrogation of Surface Agents (LISA) sensor system, and is building it for the army's Soldier and Biological Chemical Command department.

4089	 1996	a	Normally, it is football players who can use a week's worth of practice to recover from a stunning defeat. The six days between games can be used for mental adjustment and physical improvement. Basketball teams usually don't have that luxury. Fortunately, for St. John's, it did.The Red Storm needed this week to recover from its stunning loss to Long Island University in the season opener last Saturday. The time and practice between games seemed to be the right therapy. St. John's displayed more assertiveness and cohesion, especially defensively, in dispatching Hofstra, 77-54, last night at Alumni Hall.Felipe Lopez scored 26 points and Zendon Hamilton added 23 as the Red Storm shot 58 percent from the field and quickly buried any notion of being upset for the second straight game. St. John's led by as many as 19 points in the first half and 26 in the second in giving Fran Fraschilla his first victory as St. John's coach.''I thought our defensive effort and the intensity we played with was solid,'' Fraschilla said. ''The kids had their thinking caps on as far as what we wanted to do with our game plan.''

6084	 1977	a	Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin, charges that New York City's emergency repair program for rundown housing is riddled with mismanagement and ineptness by city agencies and with excessive charges And poor work by contractors, causing a loss of half the $7.5 million spent on the program last year.In an audit of the program completed last week, but not yet generally made public, Mr. Goldin described the program in terms .similar to those used by Mayor Beame when he was the Comptroller in 1972.At that time, during the majoralty of John V. Lindsay, the emergency repair program was mired in scandals, which included charges of questionable contract arrangements, loose procedures and overpayments for work. Steps were subsequently taken that were designed to remove the abuses.The program, dating from 1965, seeks to restore essential services and remove dangerous conditions when private landlords fail to do so in their apartment buildings. The city hires contractors to do the jobs and then seeks to recoup the costs from the landlords.

1377	 2011	a	Ozier Muhammad/The New York TimesWhen city inspectors started giving letter grades for cleanliness to restaurants a year ago, restaurant owners were not pleased.The grades, which must be posted in a prominent location visible from the street, were accompanied by strict standards that resulted in greater fines for owners. And even the first restaurant in the city to receive an A, Spark’s Deli in Queens, was required to pay $800 for violations that included a cashier drinking coffee in an area where it was not permitted.Many restaurant owners worried that any grade but an A would ruin their business — the two other passing grades are B and C.But a year into the program, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Monday stood outside Spark’s, an unassuming sandwich place in Long Island City, Queens, and proclaimed the letter-grading system a success. “Our restaurant rating system is definitely making the grade with customers and with owners alike,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “It provides restaurantgoers with information that’s really important to them and that they really appreciate.”Mr. Bloomberg also said that the system had been good for business. There are about 24,000 restaurants in New York City, 90 percent of which have been inspected so far. Of those, 69 percent have received A grades, according to a statement from the mayor’s office.The high percentage of restaurants earning the highest grade was evidence that restaurants that had initially received a B or a C had improved on follow-up inspections or had successfully appealed lower grades, said Dr. Thomas A. Farley, the city’s health commissioner. “The point is that all these restaurants are improving and that’s exactly what we were trying to accomplish when we set up the system in the first place,” Dr. Farley said. “New York City is known for its world-class restaurants. With this new system, we’ll also be known as the city with the safest restaurants.”For those restaurants that earned top marks, a good grade can translate into more business, Mr. Bloomberg said. He cited a recent study conducted for the city by Baruch College that found that a high percentage of diners surveyed considered grades when deciding where to eat.Mr. Bloomberg also noted a change made to the system six months ago that eliminated fines for restaurants that earn A grades on a first inspection. That waiver saved 8,000 restaurants about $3 million in fines, he said.“This is going to be an economic incentive, and encourage behavior,” Dr. Farley said of the waiver. “We saw we were getting an increase in fines, which wasn’t the goal of the program.”But some restaurant owners and trade groups consider the inspection system discriminatory and expensive. Andrew Rigie, executive vice president of the New York City chapter of the New York State Restaurant Association, said that the revised system of waiving fines for establishments with an initial A grade still burdens those restaurants that earn an A through the appeal process.And restaurants with B’s and C’s are likely to lose customers who pay attention to the letter grades, even if they are still fit to eat in, Mr. Rigie said. With the combination of court fees and multiple inspections, the system is more expensive and onerous than ever, he added.“The city needs to move away from a model of levying millions of dollars on small business owners and shaming local restaurant owners,” Mr. Rigie said.At Manducatis, a white-tablecloth Italian restaurant in Long Island City and a Queens institution, the manager, Anthony Cerbone, said that an initial grade of B, for an espresso machine positioned too far from a sink, scared off some customers and made loyalists shrug and ask, “What’s with the B?”The restaurant received an A in a follow-up inspection, but Mr. Cerbone said the inspections were expensive and disruptive, with inspectors staying for hours during lunchtime rushes.Still, whatever the debate over the new letter-grade system, receiving an A appears to be worth it. The survey by Baruch College, which was conducted by telephone and was paid for with a grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found that 70 percent of New Yorkers surveyed reported noticing the grades in the windows. And of those, 88 percent considered them when deciding where to eat.As she looked for a restaurant with a friend in Koreatown in Manhattan, Amie Kreisberg, 44, of the Upper West Side, said she took the grades into consideration. The B at a nearby barbecue place was “definitely a deterrent,” she said. “Even if we had a reservation, if we walked in and saw a bad grade, I wouldn’t go in.”Instead, she scanned the menu of another nearby barbecue restaurant, Kum Gang San.“What’s the letter?” she asked her friend.“A.”And in they went.

2043	 2007	a	When Tony La Russa, the manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, was told that Ned Yost, the manager of the Milwaukee Brewers, said that he would do anything to help them deal with the death of reliever Josh Hancock, La Russa nodded his head in appreciation.Then La Russa, trying to steer an emotional conversation back to baseball on Monday night, said, “Can they forfeit the three games?”La Russa smiled. While his team is coping with the loss of one of their own after Hancock was killed in a car accident on Sunday in St. Louis, he knows that the Brewers are playing about as well as anyone in the major leagues.Going into Tuesday’s games, the Brewers (16-9) are in first place in the National League Central and are tied with the Atlanta Braves for the second-best record in baseball. The Boston Red Sox (16-8) have the best record. The Brewers have already built up a 5 1/2 game lead over the Cardinals (10-14), the defending World Series Champions.Jeff Suppan (4-2, 2.55 earned run average), who beat his former team on Monday, Chris Capuano (4-0, 3.21 ERA) and Ben Sheets anchor the Milwaukee rotation. The Brewers also have a wealth of talented young players like Prince Fielder, Rickie Weeks, J.J. Hardy, Bill Hall and Tony Gwynn, Jr. So far this season, the Brewers have been enthusiastic and fearless.“Our guys are doing a great job of not getting giddy,” Yost told reporters on Monday. “They go out there every day and play their game. You can’t be jumping up and down. You can’t be going crazy. It’s April. We’ve still got five months to go.”Yes, they do. But, after one month, the Brewers have looked formidable. Even as La Russa mourned Hancock, he noticed that, too.

2486	 2005	a	GROWTH IN BUSINESS TRAVEL SEEN -- Business travel continues to rebound, and increased globalization is driving demand for long-haul air travel and international hotel space, American Express Business Travel said last week in its annual forecast. One highlight was that domestic published coach air fares should rise 5 to 8 percent next year over this year's average. That is partly because airlines, including those in bankruptcy protection, have cut domestic schedules and capacity, said Prashanth Kuchibhotla, the senior manager for air procurement for eClipse Advisers, an American Express subsidiary. Another trend, he said, is that business travelers are seeing some changes in policy as corporate travel departments -- reacting to a simplification in fare structures begun by Delta Air Lines and matched by major rivals early this year -- are allowing more use of unrestricted, fully refundable tickets.MORE BUSINESS JETS -- The business-jet market continues to surge. Shipments of business jets were up 30 percent, to 510 planes, for the first nine months, compared with the period last year, according to the General Aviation Manufacturers Association. Total billings through September were $10.4 billion. At the top of the scale, Airbus shipped six A320-family Airbus Corporate Jets ($300 million total) and Boeing shipped three of its 737-family Boeing Business Jets ($133.5 million).HOTEL CHAIN RANKINGS Increasingly, global hotel chains and their various brands dominate the hospitality market. The top five international hotel chains, by number of rooms, according to the latest MKG Consulting survey, are InterContinental, 532,701 rooms, up 49 percent since 1995; Cendant, 520,860 rooms, up 26 percent; Marriott, 469,218 rooms, up 154 percent; Accor, 463,427 rooms, up 81 percent; and Choice, 403,806 rooms, up 37 percent. Hilton, which operates the domestic Hilton Corporation and Hilton International separately, had the biggest overall growth, nearly tripling its number of domestic rooms to 354,312. Hilton International had 99,257 rooms, up 80 percent.AMERICAN ADDS LOUNGE IN DALLAS -- American Airlines opened its fourth Admirals Club lounge at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport on Saturday.

4974	 1990	a	Because I am a traditionalist in regard to holidays, I don't prepare fancy or esoteric dishes, preferring to choose food I know everyone will find familiar: time-honored classics like salmon, chicken and potato salad. I like to give these standards a new twist, however, sometimes by adding an herb that lends an unexpected taste to an old favorite. I use coriander in my potato salad in this menu, for example, and mint to flavor the chicken. Or I might prepare an old standby in a different way; husked corn on the cob is cooked on the grill until the kernels begin to brown and the moisture that comes to the surface caramelizes.Often it is the presentation of the food that does the trick. Serving pink salmon in a pool of bright green sauce lends excitement to the dish. Likewise with my berry dessert: on a white platter, the red and blue berries celebrate the colors of the flag. Drinks begin with tea-honey punch - a staple at our house in the summer when the days are sunny and mint is plentiful. We brew the tea in the sun along with branches of mint in a big jar reserved just for this purpose. And partygoers can add a little rum to their tall glasses if they're so inclined.For the first course, I serve salmon, a traditional Fourth of July dish in the Northeast. Baked with a green herb sauce, it's especially good when the salmon is freshly cooked and served while still lukewarm or at room temperature. Once salmon has been refrigerated, it tightens and the taste is adversely affected. If done ahead, warm just enough to take the chill off in a conventional oven or a microwave. The ingredients for the sauce should be based on what is available at the market but I like a combination of watercress, chives, dill, parsley, basil and tarragon. Keep in mind that certain herbs - like tarragon and dill - are stronger than, say, parsley or chives and should be added in moderation.The mushroom and potato salad with coriander is best served at room temperature, which means it can be prepared in the morning and set aside. If it is prepared ahead and refrigerated, warm it briefly in a microwave to bring it to room temperature.I use chicken legs for my grilled chicken with mint and vinegar dip; they're moister than the breasts when grilled, especially if prepared ahead and dabbed with the sauce just before serving. The dip can be made ahead and will keep for a couple of weeks in the refrigerator. It also can be used with poached fish or to season salads.

2032	 2007	a	Carolyn Brown’s rich account of 20 years of dancing with Merce Cunningham and John Cage, “Chance and Circumstance,” provides an insider’s portrait of two pioneering modernists who ventured into uncharted territory in the realm of dance and music. Brown vividly evokes the thrills and struggles inherent to true liberation, and describes the courage requisite to artistic inventiveness. She is a rare memoirist who focuses on her mentors’ physical and spiritual leaps rather than on herself; her guileless revelations illuminate what went right and wrong in Cunningham and Cage’s personal dealings, as well as in their fight for survival.Brown first saw Cunningham dance when she took a master class with him in 1951:“He was slender and tall, with a long spine, long neck and sloping shoulders; a bit pigeonbreasted. There was a lightness of the upper body which contrasted with the solid legs, so beautifully shaped, and the heavy, massive feet. … I remember Merce most clearly demonstrating a fall that began with him rising onto three-quarter point in parallel position, swiftly arching back like a bow as he raised his left arm overhead and sinking quietly to the floor on his left hand, curving his body over his knees, rising on his knees to fall flat out like a priest at the foot of the cross, rolling over quickly and arriving on his feet again in parallel position — all done with such speed and elegance, suppressed passion and catlike stealth that my imitative dancer’s mind was caught short. I could not repeat it. I could only marvel at what I hadn’t really seen. His dancing was airborne. … Merce Cunningham had an appetite for dancing that seemed to me then, as it does today, to be his sole reason for living. … He was a strange, disturbing mixture of Greek god, panther and madman.”Only another dancer could capture Cunningham’s extraordinary physical prowess, dexterity and deliberate emotional abandon. And only someone with Brown’s intrinsic personal modesty and generous spirit could be so trenchant about the man who has enchanted but plagued her from then until now.The book follows Cunningham’s company from its formative years in squalid conditions to glamorous world tours. Unwilling to settle for clichés, Brown questions the notion that Cunningham got his ideas for dance movements by watching people on the street from a high window. She maintains that Cunningham’s work has more meaning, and depends less on chance, than he often admitted. Similarly, she does not hesitate to claim that George Balanchine resorted to “daisy-chain contortionist acrobatics” and “girlie-show kitsch” when choreographing to modern composers like Schoenberg and Ives, teetering on “the Mickey Mouse-‘Fantasia’ aesthetic” in what the public perceives as undisputed masterworks. Right or wrong, Brown writes with the courage and conviction of a true devotee.PhotoShe rounds out the portraits of her characters by depicting them as the children of their parents. John Cage’s taste for the unconventional was in his genes. The year Cage was born, 1912, his father invented a submarine run by a gasoline engine (worthless to the government, since enemy ships could detect its location from the bubbles produced); John Milton Cage Sr. also devised an alcohol-based panacea for all woes and patented a wall-size television projection system. However creative Cage Sr. was, though, when his son’s “Suite by Chance” was first performed in the 1950s, he and Carolyn Brown’s father said “they both made better music in the ‘water closet.’” Cage’s and Brown’s mothers were offended by electronic blasts that they felt deliberately imitated human wind during a plié; in fact, Brown says, “the flatulent sound … occurred completely by chance and took Merce (and the composer!) by surprise.” Brown’s parents wept after seeing the large Robert Rauschenberg painting for which her husband had paid $26, believing their son-in-law might be mentally ill. Cunningham’s mother, Mayne, appears when the company spends a Thanksgiving holiday in the choreographer’s hometown, Centralia, Wash. Mayne brings out Wilhelmina, a floppy lifesize “girl-doll” whose shoes are still attached to the larger shoes that young Merce wore when doing a ballroom act with her.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyBrown is on surer ground discussing dance — her métier — than painting, where she is an outsider attracted to apparent novelty and too readily prizes theory over craft. She knowingly positions Cunningham in relation to Martha Graham and Antony Tudor, but when she writes about Jasper Johns and Rauschenberg she lacks equivalent perspective, neglecting the pivotal role of Kurt Schwitters and Hans Arp and other predecessors of these American artists who have enjoyed such disproportionate celebrity and absurdly high market values. Brown would have done better to exercise the independence with which she evaluates the big names of dance.

7418	 1964	a	TO THE EDITOR:I applaud Dr. Foster's suggestion that we reevaluate our physical fitness programs, but I am concerned that the casual reader will conclude that now he can with good stop exercising. This is not so. We cannot stop moving because to live is to move. Let us learn to do it as efficiently and lly as possible and at the same time learn to conserve the human body.Women, whom Dr. Foster dismissed in a brief two‐sentence paragraph, have probably come closer to realizing this than men. Women know that the shape given to them by nature must be carefully cultivated throughout the years and that the only way this can really be done is through proper diet and effective g. As a result of g, they sense a greater feeling of well‐being and remain younger‐in looks and in feeling.One element of aging is loss of flexibility. Regain and increase that element and a great deal has been achieved. Could all this have something to do with women outliving men ?

4853	 1991	a	"Turnover causes us tremendous heartburn," said Robert Coletta, general sales and service manager for G.M.'s Buick division. Salespeople, he said, need about a year to fully understand a manufacturer's products and a dealer's procedures. And as cars grow more complex, he added, that learning period grows longer.One of the earliest deferred bonus plans began two years at Volkswagen, which for every car sold pays the sales representative $150 -- in three installments, spread over two years. The bonus comes on top of whatever commission the dealer pays the sales staff. Volkswagen officials have no statistics on whether the program has reduced turnover, but they say dealers have told them it has helped.Audi of America offers yearly bonuses of $6,000 to salespeople who sell 60 cars, and $12,000 and a trip to Germany to those who push 120 cars out the door. The wait is not as long as with Volkswagen's program but the idea is the same: to keep top producers in the fold, some of whom had left as sales drooped."If you lose a guy who's worth a hundred cars a year, it's like losing a whole dealer," said Joseph H. Tate, general sales manager of Audi of America.Fritz Hitchcock, the owner of the Toyota dealership where Mr. Salcido works, calls the traditional commission system "very destructive." But Mr. Hitchcock, who has set up his own deferred-bonus program, doubts whether other alternatives -- some sort of guaranteed salary, say -- would be the answer. "It's hard to figure out if a guy is giving you his all if he's on a guarantee as opposed to a commission," Mr. Hitchcock said.Mr. Salcido and other salesmen said that deferred bonus programs like the one offered by General Motors were a nice perk, but were not enough to make salespeople stick around after several slow months at a dealership. "It's an extra, but people want money now, said one Detroit-area car salesman who insisted that he not be identified. "My mortgage bill is now." An Inherently Transient BusinessSalespeople and car dealers say they applaud any programs designed to reduce turnover and improve the image of salespeople. But many also believe the incentives or courses do not address the fundamental realities of selling cars that make it such a transient business: long hours, few benefits and unpredictable paychecks.
3374	 2000	a	The 106th Congress, with little to show for its two years of existence, has all but vanished from public discourse. In past presidential campaigns, Congress has at least been an issue, if only as an object of revulsion, as Bill Clinton made the Gingrich Congress in 1996. But nobody, least of all the presidential candidates, is talking about this particular Congress, and the reason is plain. On almost every matter of importance -- gun control, patients' bill of rights, energy deregulation, Social Security -- Congress has done little or nothing, failing to produce a record worthy of either celebration or condemnation.Nor has it been able to complete even the most basic business, the appropriations bills that keep the government functioning. Three have been vetoed, and two others have not even been sent to President Clinton for his signature. Absent a burst of statesmanship in the next few days, it is possible that Congress will have to come back after Election Day to complete work on the federal budget.But if Congress has done a lousy job for the public at large, it is a doing a fabulous job of feathering its own nest and rewarding commercial interests and favored constituencies with last-minute legislative surprises that neither the public nor most members of Congress have digested. One big reason for Congress's failure to finish the appropriations bills is that it has been locked in all-day negotiating sessions with the White House, trying to preserve as many of these items as it can.In some cases, Mr. Clinton has refused to accept legislation because it was missing something he very much wanted. For instance, he threatened to veto one spending bill because it did not contain a provision, supported by this page, granting limited amnesty for long-term illegal immigrants. But most of his energy has been spent beating back last-minute riders he does not like. At last count, there were well over 200 special-interest items ''in play.'' Originally they were attached to the Commerce-Justice-State spending bill. When the president threatened a veto, they jumped like fleas to the Labor-Health and Human Services bill.
2530	 2004	a	This is unfortunate because the teen years are a time when sports participation can have its greatest benefits. Multiple studies show that children who participate in sports are less likely to smoke, consume illegal drugs and alcohol, miss classes, drop out of school and become pregnant. In addition, for those involved in sports, self-esteem tends to rise and the ability to solve problems, handle adversity and be creative improves.''I think the biggest problem is that kids don't make the high school team, or the junior high school team, and drop out,'' said Richard Lapchick, founder of the Center for the Study of Sport in Society at Northeastern University. ''Kids think that if they don't make the team that their career is over, therefore they should stop competing or playing or doing anything that makes them physically fit.''The common perception is that the United States is a sports-crazed country that believes strongly in the value of sports for our youth. But when you peel back the layers of the onion, you see that what we really value is elite sports programs. From the professional level to traveling club teams for 8-year-olds, our focus as a society is on elite athletes. Resources start being directed toward programs for elite athletes when children are young.''There's a disparity in sports, the fact that there is so much at the top and not enough at the bottom,'' said Tom McMillen, a former congressman and N.B.A. player. ''If you look at America, we have very few resources at the bottom for our kids. We certainly have plenty of resources at the top. We can build megastadiums, pay megasalaries for athletes, but we're not doing enough at the bottom.''Drew A. Hyland, author of ''Philosophy of Sport'' (Paragon House, 1990), sees part of the solution overseas. ''I think a wonderful thing would be for the United States to develop a more active sports club system of the sort that you see in Europe, where folks keep on playing actively in leagues and so forth on into adulthood,'' Hyland said.In most European countries, there is a sports club for everyone. If you are a premier athlete, there is a team for you. If you are an athletically challenged kid, but still love the game, there is also a team for you. Clubs in Europe will often have an ''A'' team, a ''B'' team, a ''C'' team, on down, so everyone is accommodated.To change the disturbing decline in the physical fitness in America, we need to do a better job spreading the word about the poor state of our children's physical fitness and the long-term impact that will have on their health. We must have more physical education in our schools, not less. And we need more recreation, intramural and club programs that provide organized sports opportunities for all ages and levels of ability.As parents, administrators, legislators, teachers and coaches, it is up to us to find ways to get more children involved and keep them participating longer. Will it be physical fitness or physical ''fatness'' for our youth?
572	 2015	a	About flying and freedom (and, of course, love), the Bollywood movie “Hawaizaada,” directed by Vibhu Virender Puri, spins legend into more legend. The year is 1895, and the setting is Bombay. The story concerns a quest by two Indians to build an airplane and to show the British rulers of India — “A monkey can’t make a machine!” one says — what their subjects can do.But first Mr. Puri takes a long detour into romance. Our hero, Shivy Talpade (Ayushmann Khurrana), a freethinker and fourth-form dropout, falls in love with an actress, Sitara (Pallavi Sharda). They meet onstage, playing the classic lovers Shakuntala and Dushyanta. (Shivy, drunk and no actor, has been shoved into the scene.) It’s love at first you-know-what, but also a mismatch. Sitara harshly sums it up: “You’re a blue blood, and I’m a harlot.”Mr. Puri’s film is so laden with symbols — Christian imagery is everywhere — and resonances (Hindu myths and scriptures) that it’s sometimes hard to read. But an Indian nationalist message comes through clearly, and it’s an inclusive one. When Shivy and his mentor, Subbaraya Shastry (Mithun Chakraborty), need money to continue their experiments in flying, which are based on Vedic numbers and principles, Shivy’s old pals contribute money they’d been saving to go on hajj.A real man named Shivkar Talpade is said to have flown an unmanned plane in 1895 — fueled by mercury! — but “Hawaizaada” has no claims on documentary reality. Its storytelling is solidly in the Bollywood tradition, upping the ante everywhere and allowing Shivy some truly remarkable achievements. And the world it places him in is gloriously artificial: steampunk crossed with “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.” Shastry and Shivy’s lab is in a beached galleon cluttered with Rube Goldberg-type contraptions. (Science here is a matter of pinging, whizzing balls and steam, and furrowed-brow chitchat about Vedic numbers.)

4484	 1993	a	When Salvatore R. Curiale, New York State's Insurance Superintendent, started testifying today before a United States Senate subcommittee that was greatly skeptical about his job performance, his voice was so quiet that the committee chairman asked him to move up to the microphone.Then Mr. Curiale's voice began to grow, with frustration, irritation and New York accent in tow. Soon he was gesturing passionately. And his carefully prepared eight-page statement gave way to a stream of vivid, fiery remarks that sought to fix blame for the troubles enmeshing the state's largest health insurer, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, with any number of people other than himself and the staff of the state Insurance Department.The insurer's board was "recalcitrant and complacent," he told the committee. They company was "not managed well" and deeply entrenched in a "misguided" marketing strategy that "just cannot" succeed. He accused Empire officials, including nameless ones who he said were in the hearing room and not yet accused publicly of making false statements, of lying to him. And he predicted, "There will be heads that will be rolling." Blast of CommentaryFor the usually retiring Mr. Curiale, who has spent his three years as superintendent almost completely out of the limelight, the testimony seemed to turn into a free-form public venting of sentiments he had largely kept to himself and that were not included in his prepared remarks.
5323	 1988	a	The key to a trouble-free start-up of heating equipment is maintenance. This is work for the experts, and homeowners who schedule annual checkups of their oil furnaces have the right idea. The service should include a check of burner, nozzles, contact points, filters and automatic controls. Gas burners are easier to maintain; a homeowner can change filters annually, though professional cleaning of the furnace and venting will eventually be needed.Persistent problems with a gas pilot light or spark igniter should be handled by a professional. Make certain your fuel provider has night and emergency numbers. Here are some steps to take if things go wrong with an oil furnace. PROBLEM: Furnace won't startWHAT TO DO: Turn up thermostat, check on/off switch and fuses or circuit breakers. PROBLEM: Furnace shuts offWHAT TO DO: Check fuel level. If you have fuel, press restart button. PROBLEM: Furnace won't restart
3638	 1998	a	New York State's highest court today upheld an investigative panel's findings that Elizabeth Holtzman, the former New York City Comptroller, had violated the city's conflict-of-interest laws when she took a campaign loan from a bank trying to obtain city business.In a unanimous decision, the Court of Appeals also said that Ms. Holtzman not only used her office for personal gain but also thwarted the bank's efforts to obtain repayment of the $450,000 loan at a time when the bank was seeking a lucrative contract from the city.The decision marked the final chapter in a case that had sullied the name of Ms. Holtzman, once one of the city's most prominent political figures, who lost her race for the United States Senate in 1992 and lost the Comptroller's race a year later.Hours after the decision was announced, Ms. Holtzman, who now practices law privately, assembled a news conference in Manhattan, where she apologized for her behavior and expressed regret for the incident. Then, as reporters looked on, she held up a copy of the loan document, grabbed a cigarette lighter and set the document on fire before dropping it in a wastebasket.

3629	 1998	a	The German troop transport that collided head on with an Air Force cargo jet off the coast of Africa last September, killing 33, was cruising at the wrong altitude, the Pentagon said today.The German plane, a Soviet-made Tupolev 154, was flying at 35,000 feet, but should have been flying at least 2,000 feet lower or 2,000 feet higher as it headed southeasterly over the Atlantic toward Windhoek, the capital of Namibia, for a refueling stop, said Col. William H. C. Schell Jr., who headed the Air Force investigation of the crash.At impact, the Air Force jet, a C-141, was flying northwesterly from Windhoek, on the first leg of its journey back to its home base here, after delivering Army equipment and troops to Namibia to aid the search for land mines buried during its war of independence from South Africa. The two planes hit almost nose to nose.The C-141's nine crew members were killed. Last December, divers recovered the remains of two crew members, Capt. Peter C. Vallejo and Capt. Jason S. Ramsey. Other skeletal remains were found on the ocean bottom, but could not be identified, the report said.

3935	 1996	a	Almost every year when the tour returns to this misty, mystical place on the cliffs of the Monterey Peninsula, the moist air on the old golf course turns into an elixir. The Links at Pebble Beach become the cure for what ails middle-aged golfers, and players like Johnny Miller and Tom Watson and Peter Jacobsen and Jack Nicklaus somehow recapture the games of their youth and turn in performances sweeter than a ballad by Bing Crosby.How else to explain Miller's victory two years ago, his first in seven years, at the age of 46? Or Jacobsen's triumph last year, his first in five years, a month shy of his 41st birthday? Watson finished second to Miller two years ago, and Nicklaus, at the age of 55 last year, managed a tie for sixth.But this year, on the eve of the 56th playing of the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am (born the Crosby), there's something a little different in the air. Young men who have never seen a "Road" movie or heard a song by Bing are storming the place, armed with a whole lot of confidence and more collective game than any group of youngsters since the young lions of the 1970's.They are led by Phil Mickelson, 25, who already has seven career victories, including triumphs in half the tournaments (two) played on the PGA Tour this season. Right there with him is Ernie Els, 26, winner of the South African Open two weeks ago. David Duval, 24, the runner-up here last year to Jacobsen, and Justin Leonard, 23, the runner-up to Mickelson last week at Phoenix. Throw in last year's rookie of the year, Woody Austin, and the promising nonwinner Steve Stricker, 29 next month, and that's a menacing young sixsome.
2982	 2002	a	Bookstores, new and used, abound -- including one of Northern California's great independent bookstores and a local cultural landmark, Book Shop Santa Cruz. Such literary demand hints at another, less obvious Santa Cruz identity -- as a true university town. The population of about 55,000 includes some 11,000 students who attend the University of California Santa Cruz, known as the most offbeat of the U.C. branches (their mascot is the banana slug).One afternoon we stationed ourselves at the Chocolate Bistro, a sidewalk cafe near the entrance to Book Shop Santa Cruz, and took in the parade of hippies, yuppies, punks, students, street musicians, Hare Krishnas and police officers in shorts riding their mountain bikes. There always seemed to be at least one person playing the drums. (Now, though, there is a proposed city ordinance that, if passed, will make panhandling all but impossible after mid-October.)The scene was lively, too, for Sunday brunch at Zachary's, deservedly the most popular breakfast spot for dishes like sourdough pancakes. Our first night, we lucked out with a last-minute dinner reservation at Oswald -- a snug bistro recommended by every local resident we asked. The food was heavenly -- from a silky squid-ink risotto topped with Monterey Bay calamari to a dark chocolate soufflé served with a tiny pitcher of heavy cream -- but the ambience was casual, right down to our blond surfer waiter.Surfers and their culture are ubiquitous. One of their landmarks is O'Neill's, the Pacific Avenue shop owned by Jack O'Neill, a 40-year resident who invented the surfing wet suit (no doubt inspired by the chilly Northern California waters). Outside, old VW vans with surfboards strapped to the roofs ride Pacific Avenue straight down to the beach.One of the world's great surfing breaks, Steamer Lane, is off the sandstone cliffs of Lighthouse Point, about a mile and a half up the coast from the Boardwalk. Unlike many such breaks, it's easily seen from the coast, as is Seal Rock, a tiny island strewn with glossy black sea lions and harbor seals.The Point's little brick lighthouse has been converted into the Surfing Museum, a snug space crammed with displays detailing surfing moves like aerials and floaters, and the exploits of the two Hawaiian princes who introduced surfing to Santa Cruz in 1885. An enormous, 10-foot redwood longboard from the 1930's vies for attention with a modern polyurethane board riddled with shark bites.But we soon joined the crowd that had gathered, transfixed, around a television set playing the 2001 surfing documentary ''Whipped!'' It includes stunning footage of a season at Mavericks, the legendary big wave break point 60 miles up the coast and a mile from land. Surfers there ride -- and risk getting crushed by -- waves as high as 80 feet.

3116	 2001	a	Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students work in groups to study a Tony Award winner from the past through researching its history, watching the production, and reading the written origin of the production. Students then create programs for these productions and assess how and why the live, film and written versions of the production are similar and different.Author(s):Rachel McClain, The New York Times Learning NetworkAlison Zimbalist, The New York Times Learning NetworkSuggested Time Allowance: 45 minutes- 1 hourObjectives:Students will:1. Consider some of the differences, as an audience member, between watching a play, watching a movie and reading a novel or play.2. Learn about this year’s Tony awards by reading and discussing the article “‘The Producers’ Can’t Win All the Tonys (Can It?).”3. Investigate the history of assigned Tony Award-winning plays and musicals that have written “counterparts” or versions.4. Develop programs for their assigned productions that include a historic look at the musical (stemming from research); a review of the production (after watching the production on video); and an analysis of the differences among live, film and written versions of the same piece (after reading the original text of the production.)Resources / Materials:-student journals-pens/pencils-paper-classroom blackboard-copies of the article “‘The Producers’ Can’t Win All the Tonys (Can It?)” (one per student)-computers with Internet access (one per pair or small group)-videos and written versions of a variety of Broadway productions (one of each per small group, as directed in Activity 3 below)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following questions (written on board prior to class): “Think about a movie and a stage production (play or musical) that you have seen. What are some of the key differences between these types of productions? In what ways are they similar? How does the experience of an audience member differ when in a movie theater versus in a playhouse? How would reading the script of these productions affect the way you perceived them?” Students then share their responses.2. As a class, read the first section of the article “‘The Producers’ Can’t Win All the Tonys (Can It?),” focusing on the following questions:a. What show is up for the most awards at this year’s Tonys? How many awards is it up for?b. Why can’t this show take home all of the awards for which it is nominated?c. Who is hosting the 2001 Tony Awards?d. How did Broadway do at the box office this year?e. Who is responsible for Tony award nominations? How are nominees selected and winners chosen?3. Divide students into pairs or small groups of three, and assign each a different past Tony winner that is on video and that has a written “counterpart” or version (suggested productions: “Cats,” “West Side Story,” “Cyrano de Bergerac,” “A Streetcar Named Desire,” “Death of a Salesman,” “The Crucible,” “Inherit the Wind,” “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,” “The Diary of Anne Frank,” “Look Homeward, Angel,” “Candide,” “A Raisin in the Sun”, “Miracle Worker,” “Camelot,” “Man of La Mancha,” “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?”, “Oliver!,” “The Wiz,” and “Dracula.” Note that students will be reading in groups the text of the play or musical, so assign the works according to student age and ability level.) Each group conducts some brief Internet research to investigate the following aspects of the history of their assigned production. (Students should enter the name of their production into a search engine like Yahoo! or Google to find the official sites of the productions, fan sites, and Tony Awards sites.) Write the following questions on the board for easier student access:-When did this production play, and where?-How long was the “run” of this production?-Who were the main people who wrote, produced and starred in this production?-What is the plot of this production?-Who are the main characters?-Where and when is this production set?-Is this production a musical or a play?-Have there been any revivals of this production on Broadway, and if so, when?4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Students will be creating, over a period of time, a multi-faceted “program” for the productions researched. First, students should use the research to create a “history” section, in which they answer the above questions in essay format. Next, have each group of students rent or borrow the video version of the production researched, and after watching it develop a review of the work. Students should include in their review a reflection on how the movie version of this production and the live production would likely differ. Finally, each group reads the “book” version of the production (whether it is a collection of poems, short story, novel or play) and writes the final piece of the program: an analytical piece about how and why the live, film and written versions of the production differ. Students should then assemble their programs, complete with photographs, appropriate advertisements they develop throughout, and any other interesting pieces they wish to incorporate (trivia quizzes, lyrics, great quotes, etc.) Programs should be presented or displayed.Further Questions for Discussion:–Of the major award shows (the Oscars, the Grammys, the Emmys, and the Tonys), which do you think is the most popular? Why do you think this is the case?–What elements comprise an award-winning production?–How should a person behave at a live theater performance? How is this different than the way one behaves at a movie? How does audience behavior impact one’s perception of the production?–Do you think that actors have to act differently on stage than they do on film? Why or why not?— Do you think that Mel Brooks should be given the award for Best Score because he is a famous entertainment veteran, even though he is not really a composer? Why or why not?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated on completion of journal entries, participation in class discussions, research and creation of posters based on survey questions, completion of group surveys, and presentation of data to the class.Vocabulary:unbearable, psychic, glean, handicappers, inevitable, beatification, abundance, groused, elite, perpetual, anonymityExtension Activities:1. Browse the official Tony Web site (//www.tonys.org/) and create a poster highlighting the most interesting facts you discover about the Tonys, both past and present, from the site. Include pictures, quotations, and statistics that you find on the site.2. Stage a performance of scenes and monologues for students who may not have had much exposure to live theater before. Conduct a discussion after the performance about the difference between film and live theater, and encourage the audience to express opinions about their experience.3. Create a picture book or short video tracing the “birth” of a play to Broadway to its nomination for a Tony. Explain how directors and actors are chosen, what their rehearsal process is like, and what stages the play goes through as its success grows.4. Research the history of the Tony Awards and create an illustrated timeline of the winners for Best Musical and Best Play, as well as Best Revival, throughout the award’s history.

5280	 1988	a	The Soviet Union's closest Eastern European allies are following the Moscow party conference intently, evidently convinced that as the cards are dealt there, their own hands may be shaped in future political and economic decisions.Conservatives, including some of the leadership in Prague and East Berlin, are seeking to determine if there are minimum requirements of change they must fulfill.Leaders favoring change, such as those in Hungary, are struggling to discover the outer limits of permissible change.Some governments are clearly not waiting for the results. On Tuesday, the Hungarian Parliament elected a biologist, Bruno Straub, as the country's first non-Communist President since World War II. Although the position is largely ceremonial, the move is viewed as a gesture toward social forces outside the Communist Party. Extensive Television Coverage
4816	 1991	a	On the eve of his first venture into the heated world of Soviet politics in the provinces, President Bush was denounced today by the Ukraine's leading independence movement as having been "hypnotized by Gorbachev" at the summit meeting.The Ukrainian popular movement known as Rukh, the umbrella group for more than a dozen of the republic's opposition parties, offered Mr. Bush an advance sample of the sharp-edged politics that await him in this rich, sprawling republic, which the President will visit on Thursday on his way home from Moscow.Ukrainian politicians cautioned him today to expect the six-hour visit to be no easy, folksy photo opportunity.Ivan Drach, the Rukh chairman, said Mr. Bush was so supportive and uncritical of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that Mr. Bush would arrive here as the Soviet leader's "messenger," with no real appreciation of the suffering that the Ukrainian republic has seen under the Kremlin because of its yearning for independence.

3865	 1997	a	''It's impossible to talk about any other alternatives without one side accusing you of being a traitor and having a hidden agenda,'' Professor MacCoun said.The polarization has been illustrated by the refusal of Senator Jesse Helms to let the Foreign Relations Committee that he leads consider the nomination of William F. Weld as United States Ambassador to Mexico. Senator Helms, Republican of North Carolina, accuses Mr. Weld, the former Massachusetts Governor, of being soft on drugs because he favors making medicinal marijuana available for seriously ill people. In fact, Mr. Weld, as a Federal prosecutor, put drug traffickers behind bars.The 34 professionals advocating a new look at drug policy plan to announce 14 ''principles for practical drug policies'' at a news conference in Washington on Tuesday. Their move constitutes the first attempt in years to bring pragmatism as well as civility to what has degenerated into a shouting match.''It's being done to make clear to people that the argument between the legalizers and the drug warriors isn't where the action is, if what you're really trying to do is reduce the damage that drugs do to American society,'' said Mark A. R. Kleiman, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Los Angeles. ''What we'd like to do is make it politically safe to say something sensible about drug policy.''Though the people who have signed the statement are generally known for their work on issues like drug addiction, most have not publicly spoken out about drug policy before. To avoid partisanship, none of the prominent personalities on either side of the drug debate were invited to sign the declaration, which also avoids much of the language of the current heated debate. For example, it speaks of reducing the damage of drugs to society rather than ''harm reduction,'' a phrase that connotes cutting down on the harm addicts do to themselves.
4952	 1990	a	The houses are very old, among the oldest and most gracious somehow left standing in a city whose watchword has been nonpreservation. Old they are, but not too old to celebrate the Second Annual Historic House Festival, which is to start tomorrow and continue next weekend.The festivities are presented by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation and the 16 house museums where the events are to be staged. The project involves a broad range of activities, from musical adventures to crafts fairs and lectures. Visitors will find not only diverting programs but also residences that recall New York in different eras and styles. A sampling here gives the flavor. Most of the events are free. For more information: 360-8123 or 360-8163.In the Bronx, at 1 P.M. tomorrow, one may meet the ''Ghost of Mr. Van Cortlandt,'' who will give personal tours at his house in the park of his name at Broadway at 242d Street (543-3344).

From 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. tomorrow, the mansion is to celebrate its 225th anniversary, with songs, storytelling, history tours, a concert of early American and Afro-American stories and songs and re-enactments of famous duels (one resident, Aaron Burr, killed Alexander Hamilton in such an encounter). Admission to the house: $3; students and the elderly, $1; children under 12, free.
276	 2018	a	Walking in New York this season, I stumble into a time warp. The smell of fir from sidewalk Christmas tree vendors plunges me into memories: sparkling red and silver lights on childhood holiday boughs, the judder of a saw in my hand as I built spruce bookshelves, and the songs of wrens and hermit thrushes along a forested trail in Canada. This portal into the past is opened by odor alone, by the fir needles perfuming whole city blocks.No other sense is as direct as smell. No other sense is as ancient. Smell bypasses the neural processing centers that mediate all other senses. The aroma of fir trees flies me directly into specific wordless memories: childhood holidays, hand-sawn woodwork and my feet tramping through wet forests. When I breathe in, signals run along nerves wired straight to the parts of my brain governing emotional memory and associative learning. My conscious brain catches up later, adding a patina of language.This inward journey into human remembrance is mirrored by an outward connection to the lives of trees and forests. The chemical conversation between cells and air- and waterborne aromatic molecules unites all living beings, from animal noses to plant root tips to the cell surfaces of bacteria. The scents of holiday trees evoke primal experience.Other trees and their products join fir’s resinous spice in the seasonal bouquet. Roasting chestnuts loose sweet, earthy scents on street corners. Hanukkah olive oil perfumes the kitchen — sharp and green from early-season harvests, rounded gold from later pressings. The spiced wine of pomegranate mingles with the tannic nose-bite of olives and tree nuts on Persian Yalda tables marking the winter solstice. In the Southwest, piñon pine wood smoke is the winter incense of the desert mountains.

3064	 2001	a	But Mr. Bush's target audience extends well beyond the people in any given meeting.''What Bush is doing is aimed as much at white people as black people,'' said David Bositis, an analyst of minority voting at the Joint Center for Economic Studies. ''Bush is conservative, more conservative than the American public. By doing the things he's doing, he makes himself appear more moderate.''Mr. Bush opened the meeting with the black caucus, all Democrats, by saying he wanted to discuss his education proposals, some of which are intended to bring greater accountability to schools in poor urban areas. ''While there may be some discussion about details,'' Mr. Bush said, ''all of us, surely, believe the great hope for this country is to make sure every child -- I mean every child -- is educated.''The conversation turned quickly to a topic that is especially sensitive to Mr. Bush: the dispute over counting the votes, many of them in predominantly black areas, in Florida in the presidential election.Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, said before the hourlong White House meeting: ''There's nothing more painful for blacks than our struggle for the right to vote. We're not getting over the pain we have from Florida.''Mr. Bush was ready to discuss the issue. Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said before the meeting that the president believed there were numerous problems that the election highlighted beyond black voting, including difficulties with absentee ballots from overseas military personnel and news projections of the winners before the close of voting.Chief among the 20 or so issues that arose at the meeting today was Mr. Bush's nomination of John Ashcroft, an outspoken conservative, as attorney general, an appointment vehemently opposed by many black political leaders and organizations.''That was the first thing that came up,'' said Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan. ''We explained to him why we couldn't buy Ashcroft in 100 years.''
3392	 2000	a	The money will be distributed in installments over 10 months, but only if Pakistan meets certain stringent conditions like increasing tax collections, reducing its budget deficit and privatizing public enterprises.The loan has to be repaid in three to five years.After its executive board approved the loan, the fund issued a statement on Wednesday evening in Washington, this morning Islamabad time, that carefully praised the government for its ''wide-ranging reform agenda'' and the progress it has made. But the fund also said Pakistan had a long way to go.''Looking forward, continued improvement in revenue performance will be crucial for reducing the public debt burden and allowing more resources for tackling poverty on a lasting basis,'' the managing director of the fund, Horst Kohler, said in a statement. The fund dangled the possibility of a better deal in the future. If Pakistan puts its house in order, the fund would consider larger loans at a very low interest rate, 0.5 percent, fund officials said.For years, Pakistan has posed a problem for international lenders, one that has become even more difficult since Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in May 1998. Do the lenders continue to prop up an unstable country that has been run by a profligate and corrupt elite, that collects income taxes from 1 percent of its people and that has failed to tackle illiteracy and poverty?The fund now appears to be trying to put Pakistan on a short leash in hopes that the government, unlike its predecessors, will follow through on its ambitious plans to discipline the economy. A year and a half ago, the fund stopped paying out on a loan after deciding that the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, ousted in the coup in October 1999, was not fulfilling conditions he had agreed to.

6194	 1975	a	UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Nov. 2—If the boyish‐looking Arab were seen sipping his mint drink anywhere except in the Delegates’ Lounge here, he might hardly be noticed, yet he prominently helped gather support for the divisive draft resolution that would define Zionism as a form of racism.He is Abdalla Yaccoub Bishara, chief delegate of Kuwait—which has a population of about one million—at the United Nations. He also belongs to the small group of movers and shakers, power brokers and king‐makers whose influence in the world organization by fear exceeds the relative importance of the countries they represent:Their role is mainly behind the scenes rather than on the rostrum of the General Assembly hall; anyone who wants to grasp the inner workings of the United Nations must watch what they are doing.The Kuwaiti representative, a handful of influential delegates from other parts of the world and a few high United Nations officials—some of whose names may mean little to the public—are players in an unending diplomatic poker game beside the East River.How does one qualify for such backroom games, and how does one get the trump cards?Catalysts and Gray Eminences’
4518	 1993	a	In a volatile day of trading, the bond market ended slightly weaker yesterday with yields rising. Only the price of the 30-year bond managed to eke out a small gain, which pushed its yield down from 6.11 percent Monday to 6.09 percent, just above the 20-year low reached last week.The report that the economy grew at a revised 1.8 percent annual rate in the second quarter, after adjustment for inflation, had little impact, although the economic pace was higher than many forecasters had expected.Since the Commerce Department reported two weeks ago a surprisingly large jump in the June trade deficit, in large part because of declining exports, many forecasters had said growth would slow in the second quarter to close to 1 percent. The initial Government report on the growth of the gross domestic product, which was released a month ago, was 1.6 percent.The expectation that the second-quarter growth would be slower than initially reported bolstered the view that there was little chance that inflation, now rising at a slower pace than last yrear, would accelerate any time soon. And this view had helped the prices of both the 30-year bonds and shorter-term Treasury securities rally in the last two weeks.

5885	 1983	a	Here is a random sampling from manufacturers' documentations that supposedly clarify things for newcomers to home computers.- ''You can use (WSBAUD.BAS) to set the baud rate for your (computer). However the setting will only be in effect as long as the computer is not rebooted from a cold start.''- ''Remember to initialize the sum before the next FOR-NEXT loop.'' - Examples of Daisy Wheel Pitch Changes: 'The word ''Acrammed'' is printed in alternate pitch will print with the word ''crammed'' in 12 pitch and the rest in 10 pitch if no preceeding. CW commands have altered pitch.''- ''The Override procedure used to (1) override BSC parameters specified in the user program without recompiling the program, or (2) specified parameters that cannot be specified by the user program.''- ''The main menu, showing single-control-character (non-prefix) editing commands, displays at the default help level, level 3.'' Should you decide that you can muddle through this mystery, that you are going to keep your equipment, you'll be urged to send in your ownership registration card to the manufacturer. Your may be surprised to find, though, that you are not a consumer (as in consumer's name, address, etc). You are an ''end user,'' whatever that means.Having dutifully mailed in your card, you are then warned to ''write protect'' in bold letters somewhere. It means that your program disks are not protected against accidental erasures; to keep your program from self-destructing you have to put a piece of tape over one of the notches. You know, write protect.You are also told in the beginning of the documentation that you should sit in the ''cockpit'' at your terminal, facing your keyboard and monitor. Do you think that means pull up a chair and get yourself familiar with your computer?The trouble is that the words and expressions begin to make sense after a while. You find yourself ''interfacing'' (talking) with other owners, blurting out sentences like: ''We really felt the need to buy a double-sided double disk drive. After all, we have a growing family.'' Or, ''The dot matrix printer is okay if you're just using it around the house, but I'd never think of having my output seen in public without an LQP.''Should you feel the urge to be part of a brotherhood of computer owners (user group) you may decide to start by picking up some magazines at your computer store (product center). A quick scan will convince you that English is not spoken here. The following are honest-to-goodness excerpts from letters to the editor in a recent edition of one of them:- ''(The author of an article's) comment, 'The fact that the PC uses the Intel 8088 microprocessor...makes it a strictly ASCII machine' is nonsense. The 8088 processor does not preclude the use of EBCDIC or any other character code.''- ''The account you gave of the origins of the MS-DOS is incorrect. MS-DOS was originally written by Seattle Computer Products under the name 86-DOS. Microsoft modified 86-DOS for the PC and in late 1981 bought the rights to 86-DOS from SCP for distribution as MS-DOS.''
4651	 1992	a	Investigators said the pilot did not tell the control tower of his decision to abort immediately; he just did it, veering left near the end of the runway to avoid a blast fence and halting the plane in a grassy area 100 feet off the runway. The nose gear collapsed, but the landing gear under the wings remained in place, officials said.Safety experts and experienced pilots, without knowing details of the pilot's account, said he had clearly made the right decision, given the outcome.Gregory A. Feith, a deputy regional director of the safety board and a member of its investigating team, said it was "too early to make a statement on why the pilot aborted the takeoff," but he said the crew had accomplished a difficult task by evacuating all 292 people from four front exits in the burning plane in less than two minutes.Most of the injuries -- cuts, bruises, a few broken bones and other traumas -- were sustained in the slide down escape chutes, where a swarm of police, fire, medical and other emergency vehicles were on the scene within minutes, providing assistance in what experts called a textbook example of proper safety procedures.Passengers, many of them apparently unaware of the fire or at least of its seriousness, moved swiftly and with a minimum of panic, witnesses said, and it was not until five or 10 minutes later -- as they watched their plane burn from a distance -- that many lost control of their emotions.Many passengers offered high praise for the pilots and crew and resumed their journey to the coast. Some also told of a terrible hardship made even worse by difficulties encountered in motels and hotels where they were put up for the night.Julia Elhauge, 31, a California writer who had lost the copies of her first novel in the fire, said T.W.A. had failed to provide many passengers with vouchers for hotels and meals. "Without a voucher from T.W.A., they refused to serve us. They were turning hundreds of people out into the street." Chronology of Flight 843 The Race to HelpFollowing is a partial chronology of the crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 843 and its aftermath on Thursday at Kennedy International Airport, as compiled by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. 5:41.52 P.M. The Kennedy control tower notifies the Port Authority police dispatcher, Officer Philip Monturi, that a plane is down. The airport is immediately closed to air traffic. 5:41.58 Officer Monturi dispatches fire and other emergency equipment to Runway 13-right, where the plane has come to rest. 5:42.20 Officer Paul Brigandi of the Port Authority police reaches the L-1011 and reports to the dispatcher that the plane is on fire. 5:45 Five firetrucks have arrived at the site of the fire. 5:47 Pilot tells rescue workers he thinks all passengers are out of plane. 6:23 First reports of injuries are made to the dispatcher. 6:35 Officer Brigandi is taken to Mary Immaculate City Hospital, where he is treated for smoke inhalation. 6:50 Emergency Medical Service reports to the dispatcher that it has treated 15 injuries. 7:05 Mayor David N. Dinkins arrives at the airport. 7:16 The number of injured people rises to 22, including two Port Authority police officers. 7:29 The dispatcher is told that 291 people were on board the plane and have been accounted for. T.W.A. later increases the number to 292. 7:43 Lieut. Vincent Matura of the Port Authority police announces another search of the aircraft, "just to make sure everyone is out." 8:00 The dispatcher receives reports that some of the injured are being transported to nearby hospitals, with two going to Mary Immaculate, five to Flushing Hospital Medical Center, two to Queens Hospital Center and three to Booth Memorial Medical Center. 8:02 Twelve more people are taken to hospitals; two to Brookdale Hospital Medical Center, four to Long Island Jewish Medical Center, four more to Mary Immaculate and two to Jamaica Hospital. 8:08 E.M.S. takes four passengers, one a child, to Booth Memorial. 8:32 Dispatcher is notified that three packages of radioactive material have been found on the aircraft. The packages are said to be medical material and to pose no hazard because lead seals are intact. 8:45 Kennedy is reopened to air traffic. 9:17 Buses take passengers from T.W.A. terminal to nearby hotels. 10:17 E.M.S. reports that 33 passengers have been taken to local hospitals. E.M.S. later says that 75 passengers and emergency workers sustained minor injuries, with 40 taken to local hospitals.

4487	 1993	a	A Government-controlled newspaper said today that the governor of China's central bank had been dismissed, and a well-connected Chinese said the announcement was being circulated among senior officials in Beijing.Li Guixian, the governor of the People's Bank of China, is being replaced as part of a revamping of the financial sector, according to Wen Wei Po, a Beijing-backed newspaper in Hong Kong. Several Chinese familiar with the case said that they too had learned of Mr. Li's removal but that it was unclear what the move meant for China's economic policies.Mr. Li, a 55-year-old career Communist cadre who has headed the central bank since 1988, was apparently removed for two reasons. First, he was blamed for allowing a $175 million financial scandal in which more than 100,000 bondholders lost much of their capital. Move Toward Curbing GrowthAnd Mr. Li was regarded as being ineffective in curbing monetary growth at a time when the Chinese economy was overheating. His abrupt departure is likely to be seen as a sign that Beijing has decided it wants to curb the money supply, limit the rampant speculation in real estate and reduce credit without creating cash shortages in the countryside.

4565	 1992	a	Ms. Goldstein said she expects to serve more vegetable main courses. Mr. Kunz also hopes to sell more tasting menus, not in response to any pleas for lightness from his customers, but as a showcase for his style.A close relationship with regional growers is integral to the insistence on flavor; great flavor is impossible without superb, fresh ingredients. Alain Ducasse, the renowned French chef from Monte Carlo, has told students at the Culinary Institute of America that 60 percent of the quality of the dish depends on the ingredients. To that end, chefs around the United States have resolved to work more closely with farmers.Starr Boggs, the owner of Starr Boggs in Westhampton Beach, L.I., is lucky enough to have a restaurant surrounded by farmers and fishermen. Other chefs have to reach farther afield. "I'm tired of having everything flown in and there's no reason why some of the items can't be grown here," said Mr. Gross, who is searching for farmers around Phoenix.Mr. Bouley, who has cultivated a long list of farmers in the New York region, said, "I want to spend as much time as possible with farmers, and I intend to look for growers in Virginia and the Carolinas who can enrich the winter season with quality produce."Such alliances, Mr. Kunz suggested, will trickle down into the consumer produce markets. "There are a number of wonderful products that we use that consumers can't find, like fresh pea shoots in the spring that you can cook like spinach but have the flavor of sweet young peas," he said.Tight money notwithstanding, a number of new restaurants are in the works. In a few months, David Burke, late of the River Cafe in Brooklyn, will be at the stove at a new restaurant on Park Avenue and 63d Street. Red Sage, the lavish new Southwestern restaurant that Mark Miller of Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe, N.M., is opening in Washington, will be ready in February. Eberhard Mueller, the former executive chef of Le Bernardin, expects to open Opus, a fish restaurant, in Santa Monica, Calif., in March. Alberta Wright, who owns Jezebel, which serves Southern food in Manhattan's theater district, will be heading west. She's working on a new restaurant on Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood, Calif."I think business will be good," she said. "I think there's a need for a restaurant like Jezebel in Los Angeles." She predicted that it would do better than the Paris version of Jezebel, which closed several months ago.
6070	 1977	a	Baseball is one of most intriguing games in the world because it can and does present, on the same day, such extreme opposites.Yesterday's action in the major league was a perfect example. In Chicago's Comiskey Park, Jim Spencer went on a, batting rampage and drove in eight runs—for the second time this season—to power the White Sox to a 13‐8 victory over the Minnesota Twins.Last night in Cleveland's Municipal Stadium, one of the baseball's mostBaseball Roundup unfortunate pitchers, Andy Hassler, pitched a one‐hitter as the Kansas City Royals topped the Indians, 1‐0. Shuch are the extremes of the ‘national pastime.’Spencer became the first player in White Sox history to twice drive eight runs in one game. His other outburst as on May 14 of this year, when the White Sox routed Cleveland, 18‐2. He dove in the eight runs that time with a single and two homers, one of them a grand slam, the same combination he used yesterday.

278	 2018	a	Catch up: In May, The New York Times ran a series called “Unsheltered” (Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3) that examined why many rent-regulated apartments disappear every year. The investigation revealed that unscrupulous landlords, disreputable lawyers, weak regulations and inefficient housing courts all played a part.Other new protections: A landlord caught illegally gutting one apartment would be subject to a city review of all their apartments.The victims: Practically everybody. The Times reporter Grace Ashford, who worked on the series, told me, “Rising rents affect all New Yorkers — when low-income families are pushed out of the only apartments they can afford so that they can be gutted and re-rented for $3,000, nobody wins.”More resources: Here’s what renters in New York need to know.Should undocumented New Yorkers be able to get driver’s licenses?New: Lawmakers and advocates will rally in front of City Hall this afternoon to call for letting undocumented residents get New York State driver’s licenses.Catch up: Twelve states and the District of Columbia allow it. New York does not.In January, Democrats will take control of Albany and could change the law. But they are not saying whether they will make it a priority.
683	 2015	a	J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the F.B.I., designated the Black Panthers a nationalist hate group and would soon declare them “the greatest threat to the internal security of the country.” Most of the activity of his bureau’s notorious counterintelligence program (known as Cointelpro) was devoted to trying to disrupt, divide and destroy the Panthers. Hoover was particularly concerned with preventing a black “messiah” from rising within the party’s ranks and uniting blacks with white radicals on college campuses and in the antiwar movement into a potentially revolutionary force.One of the curious things about Hoover as a historical figure is the symmetry between his paranoia and some of the grander aspirations of his adversaries. Mr. Nelson’s film is subtitled “Vanguard of the Revolution,” which is certainly how the Panthers came to envision themselves. But the revolution that unfolded in their wake was the one that took Reagan to the White House, and that has frequently taken pains to disguise its origins in racial backlash politics.The Panthers’ own record, as Mr. Nelson shows, was a more complicated affair, and his film captures the drama of their rise and fall without sacrificing the nuances, the shifting play of strategy and tactics, means and ends, personalities and procedures. He talks to a handful of historians, journalists and law enforcement officers, but the bulk of the testimony — rousing, rueful, funny and frank — comes from within the Black Panther rank and file.A few of those members are fairly well known, like Kathleen Cleaver, who was married to Eldridge Cleaver from 1967 to 1987, and Elaine Brown, head of the party from 1974-1977. (Ms. Brown, author of a memoir of her time in the party called “A Taste of Power,” has accused Mr. Nelson of turning “the history of the Black Panther Party into a two-dimensional palliative for white people and Negroes who are comfortable in America’s oppressive status quo.”) Mr. Newton, whose 1968 manslaughter conviction made “Free Huey” a rallying cry for the New Left, died in 1989 in a gunfight on an Oakland street. Mr. Cleaver, who left the United States in 1968 to escape arrest on attempted murder charges after a shootout with the Oakland police, and who became a conservative Republican after returning from his exile, died in 1998. Mr. Seale is not interviewed in the film. But the absence of firsthand testimony from these three leaders doesn’t limit the film’s scope. Instead, it allows us to see them through the eyes of their followers, and to see from a distance how they reflected the passions of their moment.
6439	 1970	a	Paul Horgan, the Pulitzer Prize man of letters whose September novel, “White water” has already made him a man of $250,000, is mark ing the start of his 64th year with a display of literary versatility.Not only is the writer in residence at Wesleyan Uni versity in Middletown, Conn., publishing a major novel about two boys growing up in West Texas in the nine teen‐forties, but he is also putting out “The Heroic Triad,” which he calls “a very serious book” on the American Southwest. And then there is “a very, very serious book“—”Maurice Bar ing Restored.”Leaving his hot typewriter in Connecticut for a cold luncheon in New York the other day, Mr. Horgan ex pressed the customary pleas ure over the advances for “Whitewater.” “But,” he said with a tweedy smile, “I think my other two books are quite important.”‘The Heroic Triad’ is ter ribly timely,” he continued after jabbing at a shrimp. “It contains essays on three cultures along the Rio Grande —the Indian, the Spanish and the Mexican‐American — and it may do well because all those people are fighting for their rights these days. This book, in a way, follows “The Great River,” for which I got a Pulitzer in 1955.

4049	 1996	a	Berman insisted he would favor the division series even if ESPN were not showing it. ''I've been sold on it from talking to players and managers,'' he said. ''This offers more good than bad for a sport that needs oomph.''Costas can easily tap into his personal encyclopedia of wild-card nightmares. His ability to weave baseball-has-maimed-itself scenarios has not endeared him to his bosses or baseball. Last year, executives at The Baseball Network, the joint venture of NBC, ABC and Major League Baseball, hoped that he would clam up during his broadcasts. He did not.''It mystifies me to hear people say that this has somehow improved baseball,'' he said. ''I guess that's true if you're willing to trade the potential of the genuine high-end drama of a real pennant race for a few cheap, bottom-end, wild-card thrills.''The Dodgers-Padres game on Sunday fueled Costas's arguments: if the game truly meant that the losing team would be out of the playoffs, the Dodgers surely would have used their starting pitcher, Ramon Martinez, for more than a one-inning, spring-training-like tuneup for his division series start.''I keep hearing that all the objections to this format come from purists, as if the only ones who aren't turning cartwheels over it are baseball's version of the Amish people,'' he said. ''I have no problem with realigning the divisions or expanding the playoffs as long as it's done in a thoughtful manner. This was done with no thought at all.''Costas said that what separated baseball from other sports was the meaning of the regular season, where finishing first, not with enough victories for a playoff spot, meant something. ''Too many teams make the N.B.A. playoffs,'' said Costas, the host of NBC's National Basketball Association show. ''But if you increased or decreased the number of teams, it would only be a matter of degree. What baseball did with the wild card was to fundamentally change everything.''AIRWAVESWPIX-TV/Channel 11 will simulcast ESPN's 1 P.M. Saturday telecast of Game 4 (if necessary) of the Yankees-Rangers series. It will also carry Sunday's Game 5 (if necessary) if the Baltimore-Cleveland and Atlanta-Los Angeles series are over. If not, the game will be on Fox. . . . Look for WBIS-TV/Channel 31 to make a deal for sports news programming, starting in January, from Fox SportsNet, the cable arm of Fox and Liberty Sports.
4064	 1996	a	In such an otherwise irreverent context, this amounts to undue pretension, since so much of the dialogue is lost and upstaged anyhow. Fortunately, this film's young lovers, played radiantly by Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio, have the requisite magic and speak their lines with passionate conviction. They remain rapt and earnest even when some of the film's frantic minor players might as well be speaking in tongues.With an opening sequence edited in the high-voltage style of a movie trailer, this ''Romeo and Juliet'' does not initially promise much in the way of sincerity. As he introduces the Capulets and the Montagues as two warring Florida street gangs, screaming threats and driving cars with vanity plates (''CAP 005''), Mr. Luhrmann starts the film at full fever pitch. He hurls the audience into a world where clothes, graffiti, signs and billboards become Shakespearean artifacts with a touch of camp. Catherine Martin's gaudy, spectacular production design is high drama in its own right.By the same logic that turned Juliet's balcony into a Manhattan fire escape for ''West Side Story,'' this film draws on watery settings so that its lovers can quite literally take the plunge, and it nearly turns the Capulets' costume ball into ''Priscilla, Queen of Verona.'' (Mercutio, played by Harold Perrineau, is now a black drag queen in a white wig.) Dressed to ravishing effect as a knight and an angel, Romeo and Juliet meet here and bring the film to a much-needed mood change.The frenzy gives way to a tenderness that makes sense in any language, or with no language at all, as Mr. Luhrmann lets the camera swirl adoringly around the film's young stars. Just when ''Romeo and Juliet'' has almost fatally pushed its luck -- with the sight of Paul Sorvino raving in purple spangles as Juliet's father, say, or with many comparable affronts -- it is still able to summon flashes of purity and beauty.Eventually switching gears too often and sinking under the weight of its random excesses, ''Romeo and Juliet'' still sustains a remarkable amount of fire. Among its more striking inventions are Sycamore Grove, where Romeo does his brooding, imagined as a seaside stage, and the banishment of Romeo to a trailer in this desert. Pete Postlethwaite, as a tattooed Father Laurence, and Miriam Margolyes, as Juliet's zesty nurse, are among the actors who successfully compete with the scenery. It's a daunting task.

6433	 1970	a	WASHINGTON, Sept. 1 (UPI) — The Administration today dropped its appeal of a Federal Court ruling last year that struck down a law barring Federal employment of a per son who asserted the right to strike against the Government.The Supreme Court agreed April 27 to rule on the consti tutionality of the law, which a special three‐judge court here struck down in November as an abridgment of free speech.The decision came in a case brought by the National As sociation of Letter Carriers against Postmaster General Winton M. Blount several months before the postal work ers’ strike last March.No explanation was given for abandoning the appeal be yond a brief statement from Solicitor General Erwin N. Griswold and John W. Karr, ttorney for the union, that both parties had agreed that the ap peal should be dismissed. The Post Office had no comment.

5725	 1985	a	A member of the United States Government's Holocaust Memorial Council announced today that he and more than a hundred other survivors of German death camps, here for a meeting of former inmates and resistance fighters, would cut short their attendance and fly to Germany to seek to bar Mr. Reagan's entry into Bergen-Belsen.''If President Reagan changes his mind, we will be happy to accompany him to Bergen-Belsen,'' said Kalman Sultanik, an American who is also a vice president of the World Jewish Congress, in an interview. ''But if he doesn't, he will be able to go there only with the help of the German police.''In discussing the withdrawal from Lebanon, which is to be completed in early June, Mr. Peres warned Syria against taking military advantage of Israel's pullout from the Bekaa region of eastern Lebanon, where for three years Syrian and Israeli troops have faced each other. He also said that Israel would not sit still if Syria tried to incite anti-Israeli forces in Lebanon to threaten his country's northern border.'He'll Be in Trouble'''If Assad gets us into trouble, he'll be in trouble,'' the Prime Minister said of President Hafez al-Assad of Syria. He said that Israel had not sent such a warning to Syria, using the United States as intermediary, as is believed here. ''We don't feel the need to send a message,'' Mr. Peres said. ''They know.''The Prime Minister said that future Israeli action toward Lebanon depended on Lebanese actions. He said Israel was ready to live in peace with all Lebanese - Shiite and Sunni Moslems as well as Christians and Druse.He said he could not address his appeal for peaceful relations to the Lebanese national Government. ''All Lebanon is made up of local forces,'' he said. ''There is no national force.'' The Prime Minister said Israeli hope for border peace was based not, as it was before the invasion, on the creation of an irregular Lebanese force under Israeli control, but on a recognition by the various border communities that their interest was best served by resisting attempts to use their territory for anti-Israeli actions.''Israel will defend herself in any way that is necessary,'' Mr. Peres said. ''The option to keep Lebanon completely free from our intervention is vested in their behavior.''
3570	 1999	a	The district superintendent, Sonia Diaz Salcedo, hopes that the drive will call attention to district schools that work and keep enough families with high-scoring children to help lift District 1 out of the mediocre middle of achievement among the city's 32 school districts.It is a strategy that wealthy suburbs seldom have to think about. And it is one that leads to arguments about equity. Is it possible, parents and school officials ask, to create good schools by attracting strong students without further damaging the struggling schools they leave behind?The district began, Ms. Salcedo said, by strengthening its elementary schools, using two models, the Neighborhood School, founded by teachers, and Public School 34, a classic neighborhood school. In the last two years, P.S. 34 has been expanded to eighth grade, hoping to keep the families in the district until the children are ready to go to high school.Many parents at the Neighborhood School say they would like their school to do the same.At the Neighborhood School, which has grown increasingly popular over the years, the atmosphere is folksy and informal. Its philosophy is so egalitarian that the school shies away from celebrating any holidays, for fear of offending someone. It shunned textbooks for many years, though social studies and math books have begun to creep into classrooms, as parents complained that without a text, it was hard for them to help their children at home.Parents can follow the curriculum through letters sent home by every teacher. In kindergarten, children write that they have been feeding food scraps to their worms and sketching trees in Tompkins Square Park. In sixth grade, children plan to write a screenplay based on the Salem witch trials.It is hard to walk down the halls without bumping into a mother or father. Last week, Ken Gilbert, a lawyer wearing a dress shirt, tie and dreadlocks, led 4- and 5-year-olds in singing ''how oats, peas, beans and barley grow,'' and then, by request, ''You Are My Sunshine,'' while they inspected plants in the greenhouse.Judith Foster, the director, an Ed Koren cartoon come to life with frizzy black hair and a look of erudite intensity, proudly tells how a father arrived, demanding a tour, after hearing about the school in Katmandu, Nepal. Asked what makes the school tick, she talks about community and empathy in the same breath as academics, and tells another story, of a little boy who could not find the bathroom. But he knew, she said, where to find his reading buddy, and he turned to the older child for help.

1582	 2010	a	Ashley Gilbertson has taken photographs in emergency rooms throughout the world, including in Iraq and Afghanistan. But what he saw during the week he spent in the Maimonides Medical Center emergency room in Brooklyn shocked him.“I’m used to seeing people being taken from an E.R. to the morgue, sometimes because of a lack of technology, education or even electricity” Mr. Gilbertson said. “ I had never seen people brought back to life on a regular basis. It was so beautiful, so powerful, but for the doctors and nurses it was just another day in their life.”The photographs that Mr. Gilbertson made of the “whole human experience in one relatively small room in Brooklyn” accompany an article by Lizette Alvarez and a video by Mathew Orr and Ms. Alvarez on Sunday in the Metropolitan section of The Times.Ashley Gilbertson, a New York-based photojournalist with the VII Network Photo Agency, documents the effects of war. In March, “Bedrooms of The Fallen,” depicting the bedrooms of service members who died in Iraq and Afghanistan, was featured on Lens. In July, he wrote about his experiences photographing the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline’s hot line for veterans.
5459	 1987	a	The Government took actions today that would mildly stimulate Japan's economy, authorizing an income tax cut and adopting budget guidelines for 1988 that depart from the no-growth policies of recent years.The tax reduction, worth $8.7 billion a year, ran into immediate political trouble because it was coupled with - and largely offset by - a new 20 percent tax on small savings accounts.The Cabinet also approved a budget outline for the 1988 fiscal year, which starts April 1. It suggested that overall spending was not likely to change significantly, an indication of the willingness of Japan to adhere to its professed commitment to stimulating its economy.In response to the Government's plan, opposition parties began a boycott of parliament similar to one earlier this year that ultimately forced the withdrawal of another tax plan - a severe political defeat for Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
6083	 1977	a	VLADIMIR SPIVAKOV, the Soviet violinist, enlivened the Mostly Mozart concert at Avery Fisher Hall on Monday night with a vivid and beautifullyplayed interpretation of Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 5 in A (K. 219).Performing with the Festival Orchestra conducted by Sergiu Comissiona, Mr. Spivaltov projected the melodic ebullience of this well‐known concerto with verve and authority that remained constant throughout the work. He was not solemn with this music, not timid about underscoring the contrasts of mood and manner that lie within it. Rather, there was an exuberance about it that told of youthful delight in unfettered melody and uncomplicated virtuosity.•Mr. Spivakov was not the only soloist of the evening. Misha Dichter was on hand to play Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23 in A (K. 488). He took what might be described as the careful .approach, working extra hard to play oh‐so‐gently on a mighty 20th‐century nine‐foot concert grand piano.Since in all its years of existence, the Mostly Mozart Festival has done nothing to clarify stylistic confusions that surround the Mostly Mozart repertory, Mr. Dichter is hardly to be chided for the giant‐instrument, dwarf‐sound incongruities. He is, after all, a sensitive and conscientious young artist, and if neither his conservatory training nor professional experience has provicde ed answers for substantial stylistic dilemmas, it is hardly his fault

6375	 1970	a	A 42 ‐ year ‐ old drifter was shot and killed in Brooklyn by a foot patrolman at midnight Friday, when he allegedly tried to attack the policeman with an eight‐inch clasp knife.According to the police of the Empire Boulevard station, Patrolman Craig Duryea was patrolling at Parkside Avenue and Bedford Avenue when a woman notified him that a man, apparently intoxicated, was throwing stones at pass ers‐by.Patrolman Duryea found James Parrish, a 6‐foot one‐ inch drifter who weighed over 200 pounds, in front of 385 Parkside Avenue. When the officer asked him what he was doing, according to the police, Mr. Parrish cursed the patrol man and drew a knife from his belt. Patrolman Duryea drew his gun and told Mr. Parrish to drop the knife.As the suspect lunged at him, Patrolman Duryea fired a warning shot over his head. When this failed to stop him, the policeman fired one shot after another at the attacker, emptying his service revolver.

663	 2015	a	VARIETY PUZZLE — For those of you just joining us, the deal here is that this particular variety puzzle looks like a crossword and it smells like a crossword (seriously; put your nose right against the paper or screen), but it is only a crossword in the sense that it crosses words.From there, the Puns and Anagrams puzzles, or PandAs as they are affectionately known, depart briskly from regular, American-style crosswords. The clues are written in a cryptic crossword style, but fear not: you can do this. The wonderful thing about PandAs is that the types of entries are limited to only two types. They are — wait for it — puns and anagrams. So, from a solving standpoint, if you are not sure what the clue is getting at, you have a 50 percent chance of getting it right, because you already know that you either need to groan or anagram something. Those are pretty good odds, in my opinion.Let’s look at some examples. If you are looking for a toehold, I personally find it easiest to look for a clue that needs to be anagrammed. Your mileage may vary, of course.Each anagram clue reads like a sentence, but is actually divided up into parts: one part is a definition of the ultimate entry, and the other part needs to have the letters changed around to make up the entry. So, at 42 Across, we have the mysterious clue, “No gay anguish,” and the word “anguish” is the definition (We can assume that “No gay” is not the definition, because it doesn’t really have any meaning.) What five letter entry could possibly mean “anguish”? Just anagram what’s left: “No gay” anagrams to AGONY.Drop that into the grid and feel very proud of yourself. You’d be surprised how much of the puzzle you can fill in that way, and then you can solve the rest of the puzzle based on how many letters you already have, plus you already know that the rest of the puzzle will wind up being puns. The only downside to that is that the rest of the puzzle will be puns, and no one deserves to have to do that much groaning all in one fell swoop. But at least you’ll have completed the puzzle.Oh, and the puns: at 29 Across, we have the clue “Scams at the pump by Frenchman,” which I am dedicating to my friend and colleague, Yahoo News national correspondent Matt Bai. Matt deeply resents any clue or entry that happens to be in French, mostly because he seems to have slept through his language classes in high school. But I would bet that even Matt could get this one. I needed some crossings, but somewhere along the way it occurred to me that the name Gascon was French, and that the answer had to be plural because the clue (“Scams”) was plural. Let’s take a closer look at that: if you divide GASCONS into two words, the answer turns out to be GAS CONS, the very scams we were hunting for. I’m fairly confident I will be hearing from Matt later today.One more, because I think you’ll be entertained by this: 35 Across’s clue is “E taxi T,” which looks like gibberish, right? It’s not, I promise. Here’s how I got it: as soon as I saw the word “taxi,” I thought CAB. First, I tried dropping it in between the E and the T, but ECABT makes no sense. Next, I looked at the placement. “Taxi” in inside the E and the T, so what if we said that literally? Turns out that the answer is CAB in ET, or CABINET.To recap, Puns and Anagrams are a ton of fun, but more than that, they are a gateway drug to cryptic crossword puzzles, which are multiple tons of fun. Give them a try.Your thoughts?
2451	 2005	a	Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students design new devices to help victims of natural disaster communicate with rescue workers, government, media and loved ones. For homework, they write proposals promoting their technology.Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hourObjectives:Students will:1. Consider the difficulties of communicating by traditional means during a natural disaster.2. Learn about the effects of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans media, residents and others by reading and discussing the article “Flooding Stops Presses and Broadcasts, So Journalists Turn to the Web.”3. Design new technology to maintain communication during disasters.4. Write proposals describing the new technology and its advantages.Resources / Materials:-pencils/pens-paper-classroom board-copies of the article “Flooding Stops Presses and Broadcasts, So Journalists Turn to the Web,” found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050901thursday.html (one per student)-computers with Internet accessActivities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Students discuss the following prompt (written on the board prior to class) with a partner: “During the past three days, Hurricane Katrina has ravaged New Orleans, leaving 80% of the city under water and residents stranded. If you were trapped in your home during a natural disaster such as a hurricane and needed help, with whom might you need to communicate? Who might need to communicate with you? How would you communicate?”After a few minutes, allow students to share their ideas and record them on the board. Remind students to consider both their need to inform (rescue workers, loved ones, etc.) and their need to be informed (disaster bulletins, government updates, etc.). What forms of communication technology might and might not continue to function during a natural disaster (land phone, mobile phone, beeper, e-mail, Internet, radio, television, shortwave radio, satellite, etc.)? Of what use would each technology be in such a situation?2. As a class, read and discuss the article “Flooding Stops Presses and Broadcasts, So Journalists Turn to the Web” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050901thursday.html), focusing on the following questions:a. Unable to use their offices and presses, to what medium have news outlets in New Orleans turned?b. What is the daily circulation of the Times-Picayune?c. What was the one-line headline of the electronic edition on August 30? To what was it referring?d. To where did the staff of The Times-Picayune evacuate?e. Which of the four local television stations has been able to keep broadcasting? How?f. What information did the Web sites of two other stations convey?g. Where did the fourth station move its operations?h. What proved more “resilient than traditional media” for New Orleans reporters? Why?i. What was the state of communications in New Orleans in the aftermath of the hurricane?j. From where is The Times-Picayune’s Web site run?k. What role have Web logs, or “blogs,” played in the disaster’s aftermath?3. Ask the class to imagine that the governor of their state has invited them to prepare a report for a committee on “Disaster-Proof Communication Technology,” whose mission is to facilitate local and statewide communication during and in the aftermath of a natural disaster.Explain to students that they will work in three to five small groups (depending on class size) to design new technology to enable residents to communicate with rescue agencies, state government, the media, and family when the power is out and traditional means of communication no longer function. Encourage students to draw on their own experiences with cutting-edge technology (i.e. computer hardware and software, MP3 players, pocket organizers, video games, etc.) and conclusions drawn from the article and the warm-up discussion, while brainstorming the look and function of their device.Each small group will work together to develop designs for the device’s hardware and software and possible uses for the technology, writing a one-page outline proposal guided by the questions below. The purpose of the exercise is to stimulate both students’ thinking about how need can drive technological innovation and their creativity in conceiving ways to fulfill that need. It may help students to review The New York Times special section on Hurricane Katrina (//www.nytimes.com/pages/national/nationalspecial/index.html) for background on its effects on New Orleans.Groups should be guided in their development of a technology design by the following categories and questions (copied into a handout for easier student access):HARDWARE DESIGN-What is the device’s primary purpose and function? What is it called?-How and with what (other devices, radio signals, etc.) or whom can it communicate? Why is it particularly useful in a natural disaster?-What does it look like? What is its size and shape?-What forces or elements can it withstand?-Will it have the ability to record and/or play audio? Can it be used to signal with light, sound, etc.?-How does it run? How can it function in a natural disaster?-What buttons or other controls does it have? For what purpose?SOFTWARE DESIGN-What type of operating system (computer, Web browser, digital camera, etc.) does it utilize?-What does the user interface look like? What is the basic “look and feel”?-What information can the user input (location, physical description, contact information, health records, special needs, etc.)?-What information can the user receive (audio or video news bulletins, Web pages, instructions, directions, message receipt acknowledgement, real-time communication, etc.)?-Where and how is information sent and received?USES-For whom is the device primarily designed (individuals, families, organizations, media, government officials, rescuers, etc.)?-How can it serve groups with special needs, such as the elderly, the ill and/or disabled, youth, pets, those with certified disaster training, etc.?-When will the device be used? Only during large-scale disasters? When else might it be useful?Remind all students to take notes on their group’s design to use for the homework assignment. Provide time at the end of class for each group to briefly present their ideas to the rest of the class. Encourage students to pay close attention to their classmates’ proposals. If time allows, discuss differences and similarities among the proposals. Ask students: What have you learned about the process of developing new technology?4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: For homework, students individually prepare formal proposals based on their outlines, editing them as they see fit. If time allows, groups may reunite in a future class to prepare a final set of proposals, which can be bound together and submitted to a local or state authority and relevant local disaster-related agencies and organizations.Further Questions for Discussion:-Who are The Times-Picayune and New Orleans television affiliates reaching through the Web? Who are they not reaching? How might news media prepare for natural disaster?-Do you access news media online? How much of the media that you read is online? Do you think that the Web will play a more central role in media in the future? Why or why not?-Do you read your local newspaper? During a natural disaster, what kind of information would you expect from it? Why? Does it have a plan for such a disaster? If so, what is it?-How might the technology developed in class be used to help residents of other areas with high risks of natural disaster?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on participation in the initial task and subsequent class discussion, contribution to the design project, and thoughtful completion of the written assignment.Vocabulary:outlets, abandoned, circulation, catastrophic, evacuating, bayou, affiliate, interim, resilient, oversees, ingenuity, magnets, impacted, assaultExtension Activities:1. Develop a series of print, radio, television and/or Web advertisements to promote the technology you designed in class.2. Write your own blog in which you express your perspective on an ongoing current events story such as steroids and sports, the war in Iraq, or a local story.3. Create a “How It Works” poster that explains how levees worked and failed when confronted with Hurricane Katrina.4. What causes electricity and telephone wires to stop functioning? Interview an electrician and do Internet research, then write an article and submit it for publication to your school and/or community newspaper.5. The article likens an e-mail message sent by a Times-Picayune editor to “a wartime cable message.” Research the cable communications technology to which the writers are referring and write an essay about whether you think cable communications are obsolete or still useful today.Interdisciplinary Connections:Civics – Write a report on the roles of local, state and national government in a natural disaster. Describe the roles played by all three in New Orleans and interview officials in your own city and state government to determine what their responses would be were a natural disaster to strike your state and how they would work together. Consider the following areas of responsibility: preparedness, rescue effort, temporary housing, assessment of damages, maintenance of public order, disbursement of relief aid, and clean-up and repair.Geography – Label a blank map of the world to show what hurricanes have affected which parts of the world in the last two decades. How much damage (human and economic) did they cause?Health – Read The New York Times article “Disease and Coordination Vie as Major Challenges” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/students/pop/articles/31health.html) and visit the official Web site of FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) (//www.fema.gov/), then create an informational pamphlet on the physical and mental health risks and remedies presented by a hurricane and its aftermath.Media Studies – Visit your local library and browse the Web sites mentioned in the article to compare coverage of New Orleans news before and after the Hurricane Katrina disaster. Write an essay that responds to the following question: How does the role and function of the media change during a time of disaster?Science – Construct a three-dimensional model to show how Hurricane Katrina caused flooding in New Orleans. Use the model as a visual aid and deliver an oral presentation on the topic to your class. The three New York Times maps showing “The Impact of Hurricane Katrina” (https://static01.nyt.com/packages/html/national/2005_HURRICANEKATRINA_GRAPHIC/index.html) and the slide show of photographs and video called “Hurricane Katrina: The Storm’s Impact” (https://static01.nyt.com/packages/khtml/2005/08/30/national/20050830_STORM3_FEATURE.html) may be helpful.Teaching with The Times – Read The Times’ coverage of Hurricane Katrina for the next month, clipping articles that relate to technology. What technology played a major role during and after the disaster? How will the crisis influence hurricane watch networks (if at all)? Did technology have a negative affect on residents who stayed in New Orleans? If so, how? Write a creative essay on the disaster that focuses on the uses (or uselessness) of technology.

4984	 1990	a	Judge Souter's personal - not his professional - resume raises troublesome questions. We do not see in his past a body of experience with people other than white middle-class males. He resides in a tiny New Hampshire town (population about 2,000), lives in the same small farmhouse in which he was born, has never married and apparently has almost no social life. The Senate may well be looking at a nominee whose major experience with blacks comes from watching the ''Cosby Show'' and whose deepest understanding of the concerns of women comes from books and perhaps films.Our society has expended effort to create social institutions in which people of all kinds and both sexes can mingle. We have done this because we have more than an intuitive sense of the value of social integration and the peril of social isolation.Social inclusion can produce a truly intelligent American: one who can relate to our national life in all its facets, who knows the wellspring -the aspirations and fears, the affections and indifferences - from which particular kinds of thought and behavior flow. Social and geographical seclusion, however, may very well yield an intellectual who may be smart on technical matters but lacking ''intelligence of the heart'' when it comes to human affairs.From all accounts, our society will become even more diverse as we enter the next century. Whites will be outnumbered by blacks, Hispanics, Asians and other people of color. As our least democratic governmental institution, the Supreme Court can least afford to be managed by those from elites who have little feel for their social environment.If the news reports about Judge Souter are correct, it is fair to say that no other male nominee to the Supreme Court in recent memory has so distanced himself from minorities, women, the disabled, the downtrodden and the powerless as Judge Souter has.Justice Marshall was as correct in apparently questioning the judge's ability to relate to life as the President was remiss in focusing only on the judge's ability to handle technical legal questions. The Senate Judiciary Committee must now assure the American people that Judge Souter is qualified on both counts.

3253	 2000	a	With his sweep in Virginia, North Dakota and Washington, Gov. George W. Bush's troubled presidential campaign has wrung an essential victory from three disparate states. But once again Senator John McCain pointed up the soft spot in Mr. Bush's candidacy by drawing strong support in Virginia and possibly elsewhere among independents, moderates and Democratic crossovers. Mr. Bush's partisans argued last night that Senator McCain's challenge to religious fundamentalists had backfired, rallying loyal Republicans to the governor's side. All of the results set up a tremendously important showdown in the March 7 ''Super Tuesday'' primaries. The battleground states of California and Ohio, where Mr. Bush leads, and in New York, which is a toss-up, may well determine whether Mr. McCain will be remembered as a transforming or a transitory figure in the G.O.P.For the Democrats, Vice President Al Gore's victory in Washington State threatens yet another blow to former Senator Bill Bradley's candidacy. Mr. Bradley needed at least a credible showing against Mr. Gore in order to revive his chances in New York and California, where he has been running behind. A bad defeat when all the votes in Washington are counted could feed pressures on him to withdraw.For both parties, yesterday's voting set the stage for a more nationalized phase of the nominating process. Republicans everywhere are wondering whether Mr. McCain's daring attempt to redefine his party is an act of historic farsightedness or self-destruction. The party's establishment is working hard to push Mr. Bush to the nomination, and his triple win will restore their wavering faith. But they are not yet sure whether to ignore Mr. McCain's disturbing message that catering to religious conservatives is becoming an outdated strategy, especially outside the Sun Belt.Mr. McCain's success so far has arisen from his ability to set the terms of the debate. To that end, it was smart of him to reverse his decision to skip the final debate before the March 7 round of primaries. By agreeing to participate from a live hookup in New York, Mr. McCain shores up his support in New York and the New England states that vote on Super Tuesday. Mr. McCain's future may depend on how much strength he shows in those states, given Mr. Bush's expected appeal in the Southern states voting that day.

3257	 2000	a	The proposed merger of America Online and Time Warner drew skeptical questioning today from the Senate Judiciary Committee, as lawmakers challenged a new pledge by the companies to open Time Warner's cable television system to other Internet service providers once the deal is completed.The pledge, announced just hours before the panel's hearing, was not binding, but it provided a framework for how the two companies would ensure that consumers have access over Time Warner Cable to service providers other than AOL.Central to the framework is a provision that allows consumers to choose Internet providers not affiliated with America Online Time Warner and still get high-speed, or broadband, services over cable modems.Industry analysts said the memorandum tried to ease the concerns of regulators, online rivals and other open-access advocates that the proposed $165 billion merger could limit competition in the hotly contested Internet field.

2552	 2004	a	DEAR DIARY:The passenger elevator in our building is undergoing a total overhaul, so we're forced to use the service elevator. It's amazing how this small change harkens one back to a simpler time. I hate to admit it, but I'm hoping the repair takes longer than expected.There's a certain civility to being taken swiftly and directly to your floor. The operator almost takes pride in remembering where you're going. He's quick to make small talk, and we all seem quick to make it back. If you're just going down to the basement to do laundry, the operator will sometimes stay and wait for you. If someone is in a hurry, he'll bypass a stop or two to get that person home all the quicker.And the change in the building is remarkable. Whereas before we just stared at the numbers, hoping that no one would break the silence, people now seem quick to converse on the elevator, talking about where they've come from or where they're going, the weather outside.Perhaps it's the novelty of the experience, but I'd like to think it's a process of being conjoined by this silly lift, carrying us from floor to floor. Before, we were separated by the sterile technology of the automatic elevator. Now, we're connected by the human presence on the lift. For a while at least, it's almost as if we live in one big apartment. Gino DiIorio

4709	 1992	a	There are two separate constitutional due process issues in the case. One is procedural, asking the Court to decide whether the West Virginia court established the procedural safeguards against excessive jury awards that the Supreme Court's 1991 decision appeared to require. The second question asks the Court to resolve the substantive issue of whether the $10 million award was so disproportionate as to be unconstitutional. The case will be argued in the spring.There were also these developments at the Court today: Old Policy and NewPresident-elect Bill Clinton's promise to withdraw the current executive order on the treatment of Haitian refugees has put the Court at risk of wasting time because the Court has agreed to hear the Bush Administration's defense of the current policy in a case due to be argued in February.After Mr. Clinton's election, lawyers representing the Haitian refugees asked the Court to suspend further work on the case until after Inauguration Day to give the new President a chance to make the case moot. Without comment, the Court denied the request. Justices Blackmun and Souter dissented, also without comment. The case is McNary v. Haitian Centers Council, No. 92-344.The Court has not yet announced whether it will hear another case that presents a similar problem in a different area of policy. The Bush Administration is appealing a ruling by a Federal appeals court in California that reinstated a lawsuit by a lesbian Army reservist, Dusty Pruitt, challenging her discharge for violating the Army's regulation against homosexuality. In reinstating the lawsuit last year, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, said the Army had not provided adequate justifications for its policy.The Bush Administration's appeal, Cheney v. Pruitt, No. 92-389, argues that the Army should not have to defend its policy and that the lawsuit should have been dismissed. President-elect Clinton has said he will lift the bar against homosexuals' serving in the military. Cable TelevisionAccepting an appeal from the Federal Communications Commission, the Court agreed to decide the validity of a section of the 1984 Federal law that provides a regulatory framework for cable television.The law permits cable operators who serve residential customers in one building or in a group of buildings owned by a single individual or company to operate without a local license, while requiring other operators to have a license. A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the distinction violated the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the law.Because it is extremely unusual for a court to invalidate an economic regulation on equal protection grounds, the case, F.C.C. v. Beach Communications, No. 92-603, is important beyond the rather narrow regulatory dispute that it involves. The broader issue is whether the Federal courts will be scrutinizing regulations of this sort more critically than in the past.

1635	 2009	a	Paul Blart’s reign at the top of the box office came to an end over the weekend, toppled by the vigilante-father film “Taken,” starring Liam Neeson. That action movie, about a former C.I.A. operative on a mission to rescue his daughter from kidnappers in Paris, earned $24.6 million for 20th Century Fox in its first week in theaters, more than enough to push “Paul Blart: Mall Cop” (Columbia) into second place, according to the box office tracking firm Media by Numbers. “Paul Blart,” a comedy starring Kevin James as a formidable shopping mall security force, earned $13.9 million for a cumulative total of $83.3 million in three weeks. Paramount Pictures took the third and fourth spots: “Uninvited,” a horror movie starring David Strathairn and Elizabeth Banks, made $10.5 million in its first weekend, and “Hotel for Dogs” the adaptation of Lois Duncan’s 1971 story about children who save stray animals, made $8.706 million ($48.2 million to date). “Hotel” barely edged out Clint Eastwood’s “Gran Torino” which earned $8.7 million for Warner Brothers ($110.6 million to date).
4491	 1993	a	This Martina II, with a radiant smile, is lithe at 5 feet 4 inches. Manufacturers are already donating equipment to her. Keretic says she may play in the junior competition at the United States Open in August, which would be her first trip ever to the United States. And she can play.The young player, who is right-handed with a two-handed backhand, was introduced to grass last Thursday by her mother, who is also her coach. Today, Hingis beat Tzu-Ting Weng of Taipei, 7-5, 6-3, after her rather undeveloped service was broken three times in the first set. Hingis beat the larger player, a day short of her 15th birthday, with lobs and drops, but also with strong forehands and a growing comfort in going to the net."It's much better how she wins the matches," said Keretic, a former West German Davis Cup and tour player based in Hamburg. "Normally, the all-round player takes longer to develop. She plays everything. She can stay back and she can force the pace." Doesn't Mind Back CourtsDuring a short interview, translated by Eva Keretic, the New York-born wife of the manager, Hingis said she liked playing on grass at the back courts of Wimbledon."I've played in front of large crowds, but here the people are interested in Agassi and Sampras and the others," said Hingis, who actually has drawn large crowds of curious fans.The young player will soon return to the small village of Trubbach, where her mother is married to a Swiss businessman. Mother and daughter left Czechoslovakia four years ago. Hingis is said to be an A student and likes horseback riding and swimming.Most people who interview her voice concern that her childhood will be cut short by the pro tour."At 14, I will decide whether to turn pro," she said. "I will travel more then. It won't be the same, but we are determined to be home as much as possible."

1533	 2010	a	Stocks fell Thursday as manufacturing and labor market data heightened fears of a double-dip recession before Friday’s crucial employment report.Major indexes were lower for a fourth consecutive day after suffering their worst quarter since late 2008, but losses eased near the end of the session, Reuters reports.“Right now everyone is so concerned about a major ‘potential depression’ or deflation taking place. It’s really roiling the market,” Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vt, told Reuters.The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 41.49 points, or 0.42 percent, to 9,732.53. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index shed 3.34 points, or 0.32 percent, to 1,027.37. The Nasdaq composite index lost 7.88 points, or 0.37 percent, to 2,101.36.In a Reuters survey, economists expected Friday’s Labor Department report on June nonfarm payrolls to show a decline of 110,000.Gold mining company stocks were among the hardest hit on Thursday after being one the few strong sectors in the second quarter as the price of gold fell.Barrick Gold fell 5.1 percent to $43.06 and Newmont Mining slid 4.5 percent to $58.99. The PHLX gold/silver sector index fell 4.4 percent.The spot gold price was down $43.30, to $1,198.95 an ounce.“What you are seeing is clearly a nervous feeling about all assets, whether they be tangible or intangible, paper or not. The overall mood is bearish, and metals may not be the safe haven that you can just bank on,” said Scott Meyers, senior analyst at Pioneer Futures, which is based in New York.Indicators suggested equity markets were oversold, but fears of a worse-than-expected jobs report, exacerbated by Thursday’s jobless claims data, kept buyers on the sidelines.Thursday’s data also included the Institute for Supply Management’s barometer of manufacturing activity, which fell to its lowest level since December, and pending home sales, which dropped a record 30 percent in May.Other data showed unemployment claims rose unexpectedly last week, heightening fears a labor market recovery was stalling.With increased worries about the trajectory of the economy, investors turned to Treasuries as a safe haven and interest rates were lower most of the session. But as stocks erased their worst losses near the close, Treasuries declined. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 5/32, to 104 22/32, and the yield rose to 2.95 percent from 2.93 percent late Wednesday.The euro rallied to a five-week high above $1.25 on Thursday, before falling back slightly to $1.2480 in late trading in New York. The dollar also fell against other currencies after the disappointing economic data heightened worries that the economic recovery is stalling in the United States.Concerns about euro zone debt and liquidity problems eased further on Thursday after Spain successfully sold 3.5 billion euros of a five-year bond, adding to positive sentiment a day after European banks borrowed less money than expected from a European Central Bank tender.Go to Article from Reuters via The New York Times »
2551	 2004	a	Speaking recently to a group of black evangelical ministers and lay people here, Genevieve Wood of the conservative Family Research Council made an impassioned plea. Black Christians, she said, must speak out against advocates of gay marriage.''They are wrapping themselves in the flag of civil rights,'' said Ms. Wood, who is white, as visitors from across the country shook their heads in dismay. ''I can make arguments against that. But not nearly like you all can.''As Ms. Wood has been brokering alliances to oppose gay marriage, Donna Payne, a board member with the National Black Justice Coalition, a black gay and lesbian organization formed to increase acceptance of gay rights among African-Americans, has been appealing to liberal black clergy members. Reaching out to potential supporters, like the Rev. Abena McCray of the Unity Fellowship Church in Washington, Ms. Payne argued that recognizing gay marriage was a matter of equal rights.''We have to find ministers who will stand with us,'' Ms. Payne said, while going through her list of contacts. ''We have to at least try to bring some balance to the discussion.''

5096	 1989	a	The flutist Paula Robison presided over a lively evening of Baroque chamber music in the Medieval Sculpture Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Saturday evening. Her partners in the endeavor were Kenneth Cooper, harpsichordist; Martha Caplin and Carol Zeavin, violinists; Linda Moss, violist; Annabelle Hoffman, cellist, and Sara Thompson, bassist.The setting played a distinct role in the performance. Apart from its visual stimulation, the Medieval Sculpture Hall is an exceptionally resonant space, and its reverberance lent a firmness to Miss Robison's tone, which can sound breathy in drier halls.Miss Robison began with Jean-Jacques Rousseau's solo flute arrangement of ''Spring,'' from Vivaldi's ''Four Seasons.'' An inventive version that uses alterations of registration and coloration to suggest the rest of the orchestra, it captures the spirit, if not quite the detail, of the original. In any case, it is impossible to prevent the inner ear from filling in the missing lines, and it served as a nice vehicle for Miss Robison's graceful virtuosity.In two other Vivaldi concertos -''Il Gardellino'' and ''Con Sordini'' -and in Bach's Suite No. 2 in B minor, Miss Robison was accompanied by her full ensemble. Her solo lines were tastefully embellished and invariably played with spirit, and her ensemble faithfully matched her energy and her stylish approach to phrasing. The one movement that might have raised an eyebrow or two was the Badinerie of the Bach Suite, which was played at a perilous speed.

4408	 1993	a	"The Distinguished Gentleman" has a lot more credibility than most fish-out-of-water comedies, since it actually bothers to explain how a con man could find his way to Congress. The facts add up, and they're funny, too. Brisk direction by Jonathan Lynn and a savvy screenplay by Marty Kaplan give this a lot more snap than the average cookie-cutter comedy. What's more, Eddie Murphy is back at the top of his form, and he's not being raw, either. This film has some mildly raunchy moments, but by and large it's a holiday comedy that works for both adults and children."Leap of Faith" is worth recommending for a fine, intricate performance by Steve Martin in a non-comic role, and for other equally chancy touches, like a plot hinging on the question of religious faith. As a fraudulent faith healer, Mr. Martin holds this interestingly offbeat drama together until it quite literally reaches the point of no return. Two bonuses: a jaunty performance by Debra Winger as the faith healer's jaded manager, and a glorious gospel score."Aladdin" remains a guaranteed crowd-pleaser. For handkerchief appeal, there's "Lorenzo's Oil," a medical detective story that avoids inspirational corn. For sheer outrageousness, there's "Bad Lieutenant." And "The Crying Game" is still the cleverest film of the season.
3659	 1998	a	But there are also indications that the scandal reaches far beyond the Dominican Republic. Traditionally the numbers drawn here each week also serve as winners for a private lottery in neighboring Haiti and for illegal lotteries that operate in Venezuela, Curacao and also among some of the million or so Dominican immigrants estimated to be living in the New York metropolitan region.Dominican Government officials said the ring had agents in all those locations who were given winning numbers in advance. In New York City, the agents placed wagers in dollars on those numbers at Dominican-owned bodegas throughout Manhattan and the Bronx, but often encountered resistance when they went to collect winnings from store owners suspicious of their repeated good fortune.''It is clear that some bodegas in New York City were burned down as a result of the refusal of their owners to pay up, probably by police officers sent up there to collect,'' said a Dominican Government official involved in the investigation who insisted on anonymity. ''We also have reason to suspect that several people were killed in New York City for refusing to pay off, and we are going to be talking to the American authorities about that.''Nine people have been arrested, among them Frederick Marzouka, a Haitian businessman who said on Ms. Piera's program that he had been a ''bagman'' for the ring, keeping a 30 percent cut of the winning bets that he placed. Also charged is Col. Manuel Cruz Madera, an aide to the former Chief of the National Police, Gen. Camilo Nazir Tejada, who was replaced last year for undisclosed reasons after the first allegations of irregularities had surfaced.''There are a lot of authorities involved in this mess,'' Mr. Marzouka said in a television interview in which he displayed an identification card signed by ''my good friend'' General Nazir Tejada that designated Mr. Marzouka as an agent of the ''secret service'' of the Dominican police. ''They were using me as a front, and now I'm the scapegoat.''Not long after his arrest Mr. Marzouka escaped from a medical clinic where he was being detained and fled to the United States, which led to the firing of the director of the national prison system, Bernardo Santana Paez. Dominican officials said that Mr. Marzouka had been living in the Miami region and that an extradition request had been filed.In an effort to restore public confidence, President Fernandez appointed Taina Gautreau de Windt as the new lottery director in March, rewarding her for her effort to clean up the Dominican immigration service. In an interview Ms. Gautreau said the Government had taken ''a series of corrective measures'' aimed at ''rescuing the credibility and transparency'' of the lottery.
4676	 1992	a	METRO DIGEST NEW YORK CITY 'WELL' OF DRUGS, STREET OF FEARThe police call it "the Well" -- the block of Knickerbocker Avenue, between Troutman and Jefferson Streets in Bushwick, that has become the most notorious drug bazaar in Brooklyn and one of the toughest in New York City. To spend two weeks in the Well -- to talk with its residents, addicts, dealers, police officers and social-service workers -- is to see how the drug trade can invade and occupy the entire life of a neighborhood. A1. DOCTORS FOR THE POORIn a move aimed at lowering costs and improving medical care, the Dinkins administration is taking its first steps toward providing poor residents with their own doctors. Beginning today, in a sweeping overhaul of health care provided to the poor, welfare recipients in southwest Brooklyn will be asked to choose their doctors from a list provided by the city. The goal is to give Medicaid recipients an alternative to emergency room care, which for many of the city's poor has been the mainstay of their medical care. A1.A SHRINKING SKYSCRAPERAfter watching their cityscape rise higher and higher over the centuries, New Yorkers are about to witness something remarkable: a shrinking skyscraper. High above the Upper East Side, a cocoon of metal mesh and netting is soon to envelop the top of an empty 31-story apartment tower at 108 East 96th Street. Within the cocoon, a robotic demolition device will begin pounding away at concrete slabs and columns. And by the time the cocoon has disappeared, the top 12 floors -- 12 too many for its neighborhood's zoning rules -- will be gone. B3.

5190	 1989	a	It is fitting that, on the way to his shipboard summit meeting with George Bush, Mikhail Gorbachev is stopping today at Vatican City for an audience with the Pope. More than any American President or Western leader, John Paul II has played a crucial role in the historic liberalization of the Communist world.It was Solidarity, after all, that first broke the grip of Communist totalitarianism, and Lech Walesa himself has described this Pope's galvinizing effect on his movement. If Mr. Walesa is the father of the breakup of monolithic Communism, the Pope is its spiritual godfather. Thus, there is poignancy for Roman Catholics in knowing that the man who helped open the way to democracy in the East is also the man who slammed shut the window of renewal that Pope John XXIII opened in 1962.For many Catholics, the effect of John Paul II's papacy has been profoundly - and often literally - demoralizing. Should the Communist rulers of Rumania ever be deposed, the Pope may be left as the last absolute authority in Europe.But as we listened to Mr. Gorbachev's astounding affirmation of religious values yesterday in Rome, we remembered that it was his visits both to Beijing and to East Berlin that seemed to spark an outpouring of democratic sentiment. Perhaps the world's top Communist can give the head of the Catholic Church some advice today on letting go outmoded controls to save what is essential to an organization and to a creed.
1819	 2008	a	Since the advent of the modern primary system in the 1970s, New York Republicans have largely avoided the fractious intraparty battles that have divided their Democratic Party counterparts in election years like 1976, 1980, 1984 and 1992. But the party did so in part by heavily favoring establishment candidates and making it hard for challengers to get on the ballot. In 1996 and 2000, the New York Republican leadership’s efforts to block party insurgents made its arcane rules the focus of national attention — and embarrassment.This year, the state’s entire Republican establishment — including the state party’s chairman, Joseph N. Mondello; its elected official, State Senator Joseph L. Bruno; and its best-known political figure, Rudolph W. Giuliani — have all lined up behind Senator John McCain of Arizona. But remarkably, it was Mr. McCain who in 2000 waged a highly publicized legal battle against the New York Republican party that ultimately prompted an overhaul of ballot access rules and the creation of a winner-take-all delegate-allocation system like California’s.Under the old ballot-access requirements, which were considered to be the most daunting in the nation, presidential candidates were required to collect 1,250 signatures or 5 percent of the registered Republicans in each of the state’s Congressional districts, whichever number was smaller. (New York had 31 Congressional districts in 1996 and 2000, but now has only 29.) A minimum of 5,000 signatures had to be gathered statewide. In a time-honored ritual, front-runners would challenge their rivals over technicalities like misspelled names. To be safe, election lawyers urged candidates to get at least twice the number of required signatures in order to withstand legal challenges.In January 1996, lawyers for Bob Dole, the front-runner in the Republican race to challenge President Bill Clinton, went to court in Brooklyn, alleging that Steve Forbes, the senator’s most serious challenger in the state, had engaged in widespread fraud in his attempt to be placed on the March primary ballot. The Dole campaign challenged the petitions submitted in each of the 11 Congressional districts in New York City.Mr. Forbes and another candidate, Patrick J. Buchanan, had fought to get on the ballot in many parts of the state, and Mr. Forbes, whose net worth is in the hundreds of millions of dollars, was not going to give up easily. He went to court, and in February 1996 won a unanimous appellate ruling ordering that his name be placed on the ballot in all 31 Congressional districts.Even with his name on the ballot, Mr. Forbes faced daunting challenges. Under the party rules at the time, primary voters did not vote directly for the candidates, but rather for delegates pledged to certain candidates. Mr. Dole had the support of the state’s Republican establishment — including Senator Alfonse M. D’Amato and Gov. George E. Pataki — and his delegate candidates were well-known local figures. Mr. Forbes’s delegates were people most voters had never heard of.In the end, such advantages worked to the benefit of Mr. Dole, who won the March 7, 1996 primary overwhelmingly, capturing 92 of the 93 delegates at stake. Mr. Forbes won only one delegate, despite having spent more than $2 million on the primary, and Mr. Buchanan won no delegates.Following the problems in 1996, Mr. Pataki, a Republican, pushed through changes that reduced some technical requirements and lowered the number of signatures necessary to qualify for the Republican presidential primary ballot in each district. But the changes did not far enough to avoid a similar and even more high-profile problem over ballot access in 2000.Going into the 2000 primary, the Republican establishment quickly rallied around a front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. As a result, three underdog candidates — Gary L. Bauer, Senator Orrin G. Hatch and Alan Keyes — announced plans to skip New York’s primary. Senator McCain’s campaign faced the daunting prospect of trying to get on the ballot in all 31 Congressional districts.“There is no reason why New York law should be so difficult,” Guy V. Molinari, who was the Staten Island borough president and heading the McCain campaign in the state, said at the time.In December 1999, Mr. McCain announced that he would file a federal lawsuit to allow all widely recognized candidates onto the primary ballot. He called on Mr. Bush, Governor Pataki and the state party to abandon the onerous rules, arguing that no other state made it so difficult for presidential candidates to enter primaries.By the following month, January 2000, even before the lawsuit had been heard, the McCain campaign had managed to secure spots on the ballot in 25 of the 31 Congressional districts. The Bush campaign signaled that it planned to start challenging Mr. McCain’s nominating petitions. Mr. McCain called on Mr. Bush to stop the effort, comparing it to Communist repression.Then the Republican State Committee announced that it would seek to disqualify Mr. McCain from the primary ballot in roughly half the state.Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had already endorsed Mr. Bush, came to Mr. McCain’s defense. “The primaries should be open, whether you like the people who are going to be in it or not,” he told reporters at City Hall.As the issue threatened to become a national embarrassment for the Republicans, the Democrats saw a political opportunity and weighed in, aiding Mr. McCain’s efforts to get on the ballot.The federal judge hearing Mr. McCain’s lawsuit declared at a hearing, “Everything tells us that the reason for all the rules is to advantage the chosen candidate of the Republican Party.” Then the judge forced the party on Long Island to drop its attempt to toss Mr. Forbes from the ballot.Worried that their hard-charging tactics had backfired, the Republican leaders signaled that they would abandon their legal battle with Mr. McCain. Then an embarrassing situation nearly turned into a farce: party officials admitted that petitions for Mr. Bush had been fraudulently assembled in a Congressional district in the South Bronx, and a state judge removed Mr. Bush from the primary ballot in the district.Governor Pataki, alarmed about the political costs the battle had exacted, finally gave in, announcing that the party would ensure that Mr. McCain was on the ballot statewide. Days later, the federal judge hearing Mr. McCain’s lawsuit ruled that two of the party’s requirements for circulating nominating petitions were unconstitutional and ordered Mr. McCain and Mr. Keyes placed on the ballot.By late February, with Republicans facing the first contested statewide primary in New York in 20 years, Mr. Bush held a slim but steady lead over Mr. McCain. In the March 7 primary, Mr. Bush’s victory was even more decisive. He captured 67 of the 93 delegates, with 26 delegates for Mr. McCain and none for Mr. Keyes.After the primary, Mr. Pataki, who had a great deal invested in Mr. Bush’s victory, urged a revision of the presidential primary rules to make the ballot simpler and to make it far easier for candidates to enter contests.Mr. Pataki’s proposal also made New York’s primary a winner-take-all contest like California’s, an idea that the State Senate majority leader, Mr. Bruno, opposed. Mr. Bruno eventually gave in, and the State Senate passed the proposal in April 2000 — although, as Richard Pérez-Peña noted at the time, many ballot obstacles remain for office-seekers in New York.This is part of a series looking back at pivotal New York primaries.

3145	 2001	a	Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, explore first-hand accounts and pictures of refugees, focusing initially on child refugees in Chechnya. They then create collages that describe, through words and images, the experience of refugees in countries at war.Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hourObjectives:Students will:1. Imagine what it might be like to be a refugee from a country at war; explore words that convey the feelings they might have from such an experience.2. Learn how Chechen children are finding refuge in Russia by attending special summer camps by reading and discussing “Russians Treat Chechen Children to a Summer Vacation from War.”3. Explore the experiences of refugees in various countries; create collages for a museum exhibit entitled “The Refugee Experience.”4. Individually reflect on the experience of refugees in one country; develop a short creative work that expresses the thoughts and feelings of refugees from that country.Resources / Materials:-student journals-pens/pencils-classroom board-copies of “Russians Treat Chechen Children to a Summer Vacation from War” (one per student)-resources about refugee experiences around the world (global history textbooks, encyclopedias, periodicals, computers with Internet access)-poster board (one per small group)-markers, colored pencils, tape or glue sticks (enough for each small group)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/ DO-NOW: Students respond to the following scenario in their journals (written on the board prior to class): “Imagine that you have lived your entire life in a country at war. Many of your relatives have been in the war. Some have died. Others have fled. You and your immediate family are now forced to flee. Write five words that describe how you might feel.” Ask students to share their responses, record their words on the board. Group related concepts. Then, as a class, discuss the following questions: Can we know what such an experience would be like without experiencing it ourselves? Can poetry or works of art communicate this experience? What are some images or phrases that come to mind that might better convey what these individual words are meant to evoke?2. As a class, read and discuss “Russians Treat Chechen Children to a Summer Vacation from War,” focusing on the following questions:a. Who are the guests in a Russian village near Nizhy Novgorod, and why are they there?b. What will these guests do in this village?c. Why is it unusual for Russians to show “such kindness” to Chechens? d. What human rights groups have helped make this experience possible for Chechen children?e. What does Dr. Maria Tarakanova mean when she says, “But Russians can be the same”?f. According to the article, who are some of the other children of the war in Chechnya?g. Why would were some of the soldiers described by Maryam Kurkayeva ashamed to accept the food she offered?h. How many Chechen children might spend time at Russian camps this year, according to Russian officials cited in the article? Why are there so many?i. According to the article, how many residents of Nizhny Novgorod opposed the camps? What reasons does the article give for why sentiments have changed?j. What background into the war in Chechnya is offered in this article? What information do you still want to learn about it?3. Divide the class into pairs or small groups of four, and assign each group a country with a large population of refugees. Suggested countries include (but are not limited to) Bosnia, Cambodia, Chechnya, Kosovo, Sudan, Tibet, and Vietnam. Explain to students that each group will be acting as co-curators in a museum exhibit entitled “The Refugee Experience.” Each group will use a collection of words and images to create a collage poster that describe the experience of refugees in their assigned country. Using all available classroom resources, one or two students in each group will be responsible for finding images that depict the refugee experience in this country [you may want to direct students to the New York Times photo section (//www.nytimes.com/photos). The other one or two students will be responsible for finding personal stories from voice recordings and written accounts from refugees from their assigned country [you may want to refer students to the Refugee Voices archive at the U.S. Committee for Refugees (//www.refugees.org/field/listen_archive.htm)]. Then, using the images and texts gathered, each group creates a collage poster. If necessary, the collages may be finished for homework or in future class periods.4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Prior to the end of class, hand each student a copy of the following excerpt from “Aman, the Story of a Somali Girl,” or write the excerpt on the board for them to copy (“Aman, the Story of a Somali Girl,” Virginia Lee Barnes and Janice Boddy, Toronto and New York: Vintage, 1995]:“My mama and grandmama had been traveling for a couple of days, walking miles and miles with their animals, searching for water. Mama was nine months pregnant. When you live out in the bush with animals … you’ve got to find water and grass for them. Some people go where water has fallen – you have to follow the rain.”Ask students to write a short piece in a similar style that describes the experience of a child refugee from the country they investigated in class. In a future class, display the collage posters and writings to create your “The Refugee Experience” exhibit. Invite other classes to view the exhibit.Further Questions for Discussion:–Who are the groups fighting in Chechnya? Who are the rebels, and what do they want?–What is an oral history? How do oral histories differ from other historical accounts? What role does subjective experience play in an account of history?–Do you agree with Dr. Maria Tarakanova when she says “children, whether they are Armenian, Chechen or Russian, are all the same”? Why or why not?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on written journal entries, participation in class discussions, participation in group research, thoughtful completion of group collages, and thoughtfully written first-person depictions of the experiences of refugee children.Vocabulary:respite, sanitariums, liturgies, refugee, anthem, conscripts, chaperone, demobilized, muster, offspring, militia, impoverished, tolerant, sentimentExtension Activities:1. Using historic periodicals, Web sites, and other resources, explore in greater depth the country assigned to your group in class. Create an illustrated timeline of the conflict that sent the refugees in that country into exile. What groups were fighting each other? When did the conflict first arise? What subsequent conflicts arose through time? What events caused refugees to leave that country? How many refugees fled and where did they resettle?2. Using cardboard, paper, clay, and other materials, create a topographical map of Chechnya. What countries surround Chechnya? How have the topographical features of Chechnya influenced political boundaries in that region? How have these features influenced the war there?3. Research the organizations that help refugees. What type of aid is available for war refugees? What goods and services are needed by refugees? How can individuals who want to help refugees become involved? Organize a drive for clothing, toys, or other goods that will aid refugees from a country you studied in class.4. Find a pen-pal network and set up correspondence with a refugee student from the country you studied in class.Interdisciplinary Connections:Civics- Research refugee situations around the world at the site of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (//www.unhcr.ch/welcome.htm), and write an article titled “Who Is a Refugee?” Can soldiers be refugees? Can criminals? What rights do refugees have, according to the United Nations?Fine Arts- Listen to the song “Imagine” by John Lennon. What was the artist trying to convey in this song? Does the information you gathered in class relate in any way to this song? Write your own song that conveys how people should live in the world. What lyrical images might convey what you learned about the refugees studied in class?Health- According to the article, “many of the Chechen children bear the psychological or physical scars of war.” Research the health problems of refugees who resettle in a new country. What health effects do traumatizing experiences cause? What treatments are available? Find the programs in your community that help refugees to cope with these problems, and write a guidebook of programs for helping refugees in your community. If possible, visit the organizations sponsoring these programs and find out how you can help.Journalism- Interview someone who has experienced war first-hand, and write an article describing what you learn. What war did this person experience? What was his or her “participation” in this war? Did he or she support the war? Why or why not? How did the experience change this person? Would the person be willing to participate in the same way again? Why or why not?Other Information on the Web:Crisis in North Caucasus (//www.cdi.org/issues/Europe/ncaucasus.html) offers analysis, interviews, maps, and research from the Center for Defense Information.Chechnya: A Land in Conflict (//russianculture.about.com/culture/russianculture/library/weekly/aa092099.htm) provides background on the conflict and a look at inhabitants of the region, from About.com.Human Rights Watch: Chechnya (//www.hrw.org/campaigns/russia/chechnya/) presents press releases and reports on the Russian incursion into Chechnya.Chechen Republic Online (//www.amina.com) contains news, maps, audiovisual content, and more on the Republic.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8World History Standard 44- Understands the search for community, stability, and peace in an interdependent world.

1452	 2010	a	It is a long-standing tradition that presidents send letters of condolence to the families of troops killed at war, whether by enemy fire, accident or illness. But since the Clinton administration at least, one group has not received those hand-signed notes: families of troops who committed suicide, even those who killed themselves while deployed to a war front.It turns out, though, that on at least one occasion a president has made an exception to the no-letter protocol.In 2005, 20-year-old Pfc. Jason Scheuerman killed himself while in Iraq with the 3rd Infantry Division. His father, Chris Scheuerman, a retired Army master sergeant, said his son had been struggling with depression and doubts about the war, and had sought counseling in the weeks before he died. But an Army psychologist who had not yet received his license to practice declared that Private Scheuerman might be feigning problems.His commanding officers decided he was a “malingerer,” records obtained by Mr. Scheuerman showed, and sent him back to his unit. He was given back his weapon, but denied access to the Internet and telephone. About three weeks later he shot himself after tacking a note to his closet door that read, “I know you think I’m a coward for this but in the face of existing as I am now, I have no other choice.”After learning about his son’s death, Mr. Scheuerman assumed that he would receive a letter from the president. When none arrived, he inquired with the White House and was subsequently told of the no-letter policy for suicides.That policy, government officials have said, is based on concerns among senior military leaders that presidential letters of condolence might appear to condone or even encourage suicide.Mr. Scheuerman wrote back arguing that the protocol was wrongheaded, particularly at a time when the Defense Department was trying to slow a rising tide of suicides. Last year, there were more than 300 suicides by active-duty military personnel members, the most since the Pentagon started keeping track in 1980. While most suicides occur on military bases in the United States, more than 184 troops have killed themselves while deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan since 2001.“The fact that we continue the policy, we continue to stigmatize soldiers who suffer from mental illness,” Mr. Scheuerman said in a recent interview. “And we continue to punish the families of soldiers who succumb to the trauma of mental illness that nine years of war has cumulatively heaped upon them.”The White House did not respond to Mr. Scheuerman’s second letter. But in late 2005, the son of the Indianapolis Colts’ coach Tony Dungy committed suicide, and President George W. Bush sent him a letter of condolence.“I pray for you,” the president wrote in a letter that was read at James Dungy’s funeral. “May God keep you. May his light shine upon you.”Mr. Scheuerman fired off a hand-written note to the White House asking why the son of a military family should be treated differently from the son of a professional football coach. (In addition to Mr. Scheuerman and his son Jason, Mr. Scheuerman’s wife, oldest son and other members of his extended family have served in the military.)“Not taking away from the tragedy the Dungy family had experienced, I felt we had given a whole lot more and sacrificed a great much more for our nation’s safety than a football coach,” Mr. Scheuerman said in an interview.A few weeks later, in March 2006, a letter from the White House arrived at the Scheuerman home in Sanford, N.C., near Fort Bragg, where Mr. Scheuerman worked at the time.“Laura and I are saddened by the loss of your son, Jason,” the letter, signed by President Bush, said. “We know this has been a difficult time for you, and we send our heartfelt sympathy.”Mr. Bush’s letter to Mr. Scheuerman surfaced only recently after he shared it with an Indianapolis man, Gregg Keesling, whose son committed suicide in Iraq last year. In an e-mail message, Mr. Keesling said he hoped that Mr. Bush’s letter would show that presidents have the flexibility to send letters based on a service member’s record, not on how the service member died.“My son, and probably the vast majority who die by suicide, had honorable service,” he wrote.At Mr. Keesling’s behest, two congressmen from Indiana have urged the Obama administration to modify the no-letter policy. White House aides say it is under review.

1508	 2010	a	Michelle V. Agins/The New York Times; right, Barton Silverman/The New York TimesWork It Out Sweat is a new biweekly series about sports. Post a Comment »There was a certain buzz at the dinner table a few months ago. My sons had heard that the new Mets left fielder, Jason Bay, was considering moving to our town of Larchmont from the Boston area, where he had played for the Red Sox. I barely paid attention, since baseball chatter around our house is constant background noise.A few days later, they were talking about it again. One son claimed he and his friends walked past Mr. Bay’s house on the way to Hebrew school. But I was still fairly sure this was one of those false rumors that fly around a small community and gather steam as they hit the schools.Then proof arrived, in the form of a tidbit my husband discovered on the Web site of Major League Baseball, which was then picked up by our local online newspaper, The Larchmont Gazette. Mr. Bay had indeed chosen our town over Connecticut — even though apparently all his friends had urged him to move to Greenwich, the ritzier community up north.“Larchmont is as far as we wanted to go from the ballpark,” Mr. Bay was quoted as saying.We were all so proud.If you thought my sons, especially 11-year-old Gabriel, were excited before, the confirmation ratcheted up the tension. In fact, among local baseball lovers of a certain age — a very wide range as far as I can tell — Mr. Bay’s move here was more thrilling than when Timothy F. Geithner, also a Larchmont resident, was selected by President Obama to become his Treasury secretary.Gabriel and his friends went into high gear. Every time they passed Mr. Bay’s house, they sought a glimpse of him. Once there was a near miss: they saw him driving off. A friend of Gabriel’s suggested bringing brownies as a welcome present. They also wondered whether Mr. Bay’s two children would play in Little League, and they were not discouraged when they found out he has two little girls. Maybe he would come to one of their games and give hitting tips!The possibilities seemed endless.And as time passed, the buzz grew. At dinner parties, adults argued about which house was Mr. Bay’s. (“It’s the green one near the library.” “No, it’s the one with all the windows.”) The village seemed more speckled with Mets shirts than in years past.For his part, Gabriel decided to write Mr. Bay a letter and wrap it around a baseball. I quote in part: “I am a huge Mets fan (like die-hard even in the years when they weren’t so good!) Here is a baseball. Can you sign it and return it to your mailbox this week between 2:25 and 3:15 (so I can retrieve it).” He was going to put it in the Bays’ mailbox, but it was locked, so he stuck the letter and baseball between boards in their white picket fence.I found something sweetly old-fashioned about all this. Gabriel wrote the note without any parental interference. He and his friends could walk past the home of a player on their favorite team, and it wasn’t a fancy mansion behind security gates. With the various scandals and multimillion-dollar salaries that sour many people on professional sports, it was redeeming to see their enthusiasm and hopes.Gabriel went back to Mr. Bay’s house the day after he left the ball in the fence. It was gone. I assumed it had either been taken by someone else or simply tossed out.The following day he checked again. This time he was wearing his Mets T-shirt with “Bay” on the back and No. 44. Again, no ball. I was rapidly losing interest and figured this would be another one of life’s sad little lessons.On the third day he and a friend went by — and the ball was in the fence! Signed! Gabriel was overjoyed, and his friend immediately asked if he had another paper and pen, to leave his own message.“This is the greatest day of my life,” Gabriel told my husband.I’m sorry, Mr. Bay, if your fence will now look like the Western Wall in Jerusalem, where people leave notes to God. But thank you for answering a little boy’s prayers. And welcome to the neighborhood.
3410	 1999	a	Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students investigate ways in which children their age can become involved in community service projects, specifically focusing on simple fundraisers that they can organize and execute.Author(s):Alison Zimbalist, The New York Times Learning NetworkSuggested Time Allowance: 45 minutesObjectives:Students will:1. Examine the definition of community service, as well as determine the needs of people in their community and what types of service a student can offer.2. Analyze the steps in planning and executing a fundraiser through reading and discussing “Banking on Super Bowl To Help Feed the Hungry.”3. Brainstorm what a group would need to do to organize a fundraising project such as the one discussed in the article.4. Develop basic plans, in small groups, for fundraising projects that they could actually organize and execute.5. Explore the importance of caring about others in your community who are in some type of situation of need, and share past experiences with service projects.Resources / Materials:-paper-pens/pencils-classroom blackboard-student journals-“Banking on Super Bowl To Help Feed the Hungry” (one per student)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/ DO-NOW: In the first five minutes of class, each student responds to the following (written on the board prior to class) on a piece of paper:–What is community service?–What types of people in need of community service exist in your community?–What types of service can a person your age offer as an act of giving to a person who is in need in some way?Students then share and discuss their responses, and the teacher writes them on the board.2. Read and discuss “Banking on Super Bowl To Help Feed the Hungry,” focusing on the following questions:a. How did the Souper Bowl service project originate?b. How has the Souper Bowl project spread to other cities and states?c. What basic materials do students involved in the Souper Bowl project need to make their fundraising efforts successful?d. How does this fundraiser meet the needs of the communities in which it is held?e. What does Brad Smith mean when he says, “We can acknowledge that football transcends many things in our society, and we can use that for good”?f. What makes the Souper Bowl project a simple fundraising project in which to participate?g. What other national events or holidays have service projects tied to them (e.g., Toys for Tots and Christmas)? Why are these big events useful in encouraging people to give money, items, and time to those in need?h. What benefits might be gained by a fundraising organization in obtaining sponsorship from corporations or spokespeople?3. As a class, discuss what a group would need to do to organize a fundraising project such as the one discussed in the article, keeping in mind the Souper Bowl Sunday project and the student responses from the initial class procedure. The teacher should write ideas on the board in preparation for the next procedure.4. Tell students that they will be developing a basic plan for a fundraising project that they could actually organize and execute. Students divide into small groups of three or four. Each group decides upon a yearly event (such as a holiday, a national or local yearly event tied to a season, sports, tradition, and so on) to which the service project can be tied. Then, each group begins planning a service project by responding to the following questions:–Who will be the recipients of your project’s funds, and what needs does this group of people have that can be met by the funds you raise?–How will you raise money for these recipients (e.g., selling flowers, bake sale, washing cars, sponsoring a dance-a-thon)? Be creative!–What adults will need to help you with this project, and how?–What other students will need to help you with this project, and how?–Where will this fundraiser be held, and why is this location a good choice?–What materials would you need for this project (what you will be selling, as well as other equipment such as a table or posters explaining the project)?–How and where will you advertise this project?–What is the name of your fundraiser? (Must tie into the event and the type of service provided.)Students present their fundraising project plans to the class. Students may vote on the project they like best as a class fundraising project.5. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: In their journals, students respond to the following questions: Why is it important to care about others in your community who are in some type of need? How have you helped someone in your community, and how did it make you feel? Students can share their answers in a future class.Further Questions for Discussion:–What is the definition of “community service”?–In what ways can people give of themselves to others?–What types of acts do you consider to be “charitable”?–What types of service can a person your age offer as an act of giving to a person who is in need in some way?–How was the Souper Bowl project originally started, and how has it evolved since its inception?–What steps are involved in planning a service project?–What national events or holidays have service projects tied to them, and why are these big events useful in encouraging people to give money, items, and time to those in need?–In what service or fundraising projects is your school involved?–How could a person go about getting involved in a community service project or other charitable project?–What is the importance of fundraising in our society?–What experiences have you had in participating in community service?–What types of everyday acts of giving do you perform?–How does performing acts of giving or good deeds for others make you feel?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on initial writing exercise, class discussion, thoughtful participation in small group planning of a fundraiser, and written journal response.Vocabulary:cul-de-sac, conspicuous, consumption, parishioners, divinity, publicizing, contemporary, materialistic, trappings, transcends, bandwagon, integrity, gleans, bombarded, stewardsExtension Activities:1. Create an informational poster about a specific service organization (the Internet is a great place to do your searching). When, where, and why was the organization founded? Who was the founder? What services did the organization originally provide, and what does the organization do now?2. Locate charitable organizations in your community. How do the needs met by these organizations reflect the needs of your community? What organizations do you think need to be developed, and why?3. Research a local or national fundraising project. How and when did the project begin, and how has it grown since then?4. Write letters to large businesses in your community asking about the types of community service or fundraising projects in which they are involved.5. Visit a soup kitchen, food bank, homeless shelter, or other location in which you can donate your time to help someone in need.6. Write a reflective essay defining “community” and “service” and discussing reasons why people should offer service to members of their community. Include your personal experiences with community service and charitable acts in your writing.7.

100	 2019	a	Foradori Vigneti Delle Dolomiti Teroldego 2016 (Louis/Dressner Selections, New York) $25This trio of grapes — freisa, schiava and teroldego — is far from the most obscure that Italy has to offer. I might have considered cornalin or fumin, pelaverga or grignolino, gaglioppo or schioppettino, but the three I chose may be a little easier to find. You can try them if they come from other producers or vintages as well.Still, if you find one of these other grapes I mentioned and prefer to try that, why not? Or if you discover something you have never heard of before, go for it. The idea here is exploration. The variety is endless.None of the three wines I recommended is heavy. They are bright and aromatic, and ought to be delicious summer reds suitable with either meat dishes or light pastas. Don’t hesitate to serve them lightly cool.Often when I suggest somewhat obscure wines, somebody will respond that they already know what they like, why try something different? I get that. People often feel that way about the foods they enjoy and the friends they already have in their lives.
1401	 2011	a	MADISON, Wis. — Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany spent about an hour before Nebraska’s debut game in the Big Ten taking pictures with Cornhusker fans.“Thanks for the invite,” repeated fan after fan, with their tone implying that they were happy to be out of the Big 12.In an interview outside Camp Randall Stadium, Delany seemed to relish the scene he had helped create. An estimated 30,000 Nebraska fans poured into Madison for the game, and they helped make for a boisterous atmosphere.“It’s more than you could hope for in a way,” Delany said. “We couldn’t have predicted the teams would open up undefeated.”Delany said it could take five years to know whether the conference realignment frenzy has calmed in a significant way. He maintained that the Big Ten would not change just to change and lamented how a lot of the changes occurred.“It’s not sometimes the decisions that you make that are so key, it’s the decisions that you don’t make,” he said. “Most injuries are self-inflicted, they’re not necessarily inflicted by others. Unfortunately in my view, while there’s always been some change, it hasn’t really been evolutionary, it’s been a little more revolutionary.”Delany said that he sees leagues trying to force stability through increasing exit fees. “Usually those things happen as a result of comfort, not necessarily to ensure comfort and stability,” he said.

4092	 1995	a	BEYOND UHURA "Star Trek" and Other Memories. By Nichelle Nichols. Putnam, $22.95.Nichelle Nichols, best known as the communications officer on the Starship Enterprise on "Star Trek," has written a monotonous memoir in "Beyond Uhura." Her narrative begins with her 19th-century ancestors, continues with her Midwestern childhood and concludes with the twilight of her "Star Trek" career. But there is little more here than endless brushes with greatness and repetitious hosannas to her onetime lover, Gene Roddenberry, the producer and creator of "Star Trek." And that's a pity, because to read between the lines of "Beyond Uhura" is to uncover the story of a competent performer entangled in a capricious profession and its exclusionary and often humiliating practices. Ms. Nichols has some good stories to tell, but she fails to engage. TONI L. KAMINS
5299	 1988	a	Swimming heads the list of 40 participant sports in a survey taken in 1987 by the National Sporting Goods Association. More than 66 million Americans took the plunge last year, and swimming was followed in the poll by exercise walking (58.1 million), which drew the most new participants (7.2 million).A participant is defined as someone 7 years of age or older who plays a sport more than once during a year. In swimming, exercise walking, bicycling, exercising with equipment, running and jogging, and aerobics, the participant must have engaged in the activity six times or more during the year.

698	 2015	a	A celebration of spinning vinyl and twirling teenagers, “Northern Soul” captures a brief, blazing moment in 1970s England when the passionate lyrics and addictive beats of American soul ignited dance floors and working-class dreams.Two dreamers take center stage. John (Elliot James Langridge), a high school misfit and all-around mope, is dazzled and flattered when Matt (Joshua Whitehouse), a skinny show-off and virtual orphan, befriends him at the youth club. Introduced to flared trousers and flashy dance moves — with a side order of aggro and amphetamines — John is soon a willing member of the cult of rare recordings.Funny and feisty, gritty and sometimes grim, this first feature from the photographer Elaine Constantine delivers a sweaty snapshot of a very specific time and place. Surrounded by industrial drabness, the dance halls of Lancashire pulse with light and movement. Squeaky-clean pop is fading, and disco is waiting in the wings, but for these kids, it’s Edwin Starr and Frankie Valli who offer escape from sausage factory futures and nagging parents.Performed with loose energy and studded with beautifully observant moments — like the worn spot on the hideous bedroom carpet where John practices his spins — “Northern Soul” suffers most from a lack of dramatic focus and a tendency to elbow women out of the frame. There’s tragedy, and there is disillusion, but Ms. Constantine’s writing is no match for her empathy and ability to conjure atmosphere. That said, the songs are smashing and the stomping joy infectious, smoothly summoning the way music can inject hope into the bleakest of lives.
4020	 1996	a	To the Editor:Lawrence Krauss (Op-Ed, July 29) does a disservice to the public and to the scientific community to argue that ''a theory whose predictions fail the test of experiment is always wrong, period.'' Far from it. This argument, known in the jargon of philosophy of science as ''naive methodological falsificationism,'' is indefensible.Social scientists are familiar with debates that ensue when a theory fails to predict accurately. Do we junk the theory after a single prediction failure? Of course not. The theory may indeed be wrong. But it may also be that we did not derive the predictions accurately from the theory. Or we made mistakes in measuring the data. Or the experiment was poorly constructed, so that it was not a definitive test. Or perhaps we have run into unexplained variance, since no theory explains everything all the time.Physicists are better than social scientists at making sure that predictions do derive directly from the theories they test. And they often have better means of measuring data than do social scientists. But few physicists I know would discard a theory for prediction failure without thinking through a number of reasons the prediction failed.Scientific debate is about trying to agree on what experiments to conduct and how to interpret the results, in ways that can falsify theories. It is a hard discussion.

1579	 2010	a	Our House forecasting model continues to show Republicans as having about a two-in-three chance — 67 percent — of taking over the House on Nov. 2, similar to the forecast in recent weeks.The most likely number of Republican pickups is in the range of about 45 seats — although significantly larger or smaller gains remain possible. The model does not expect a clean sweep: Democrats are favorites in 4 seats currently held by Republicans. But Republicans are favorites in exactly 50 Democratic-held seats, according to the model, which would be enough to give them control of the House.As in past weeks, the various indicators that the model uses to formulate its forecasts show varied patterns.The Democrats’ position in the generic ballot has improved slightly. But they remain about 6 points behind the Republicans among likely voters.Expert forecasters, like Cook Political and the Rothenberg Political Report, continue to move their characterizations of races slowly but steadily in the direction of Republicans.Local polling tends to be ambiguous. There were a handful of poor polls for Democrats this week — one, for instance, showed the outspoken incumbent Alan Grayson trailing in his race in Florida’s 8th congressional district. But in other districts, Democrats have released campaign polls showing themselves to be in a reasonably strong position, and Republican campaigns have not always countered them.As we remarked last week, Democrats seem to be in a more vulnerable position in the Midwest than elsewhere in the country. Of the 50 Democratic-held seats that the model regards Republicans having at least even odds of gaining, 6 are in Pennsylvania, and 3 are in Ohio, and several seats in Michigan, Illinois and Iowa are also vulnerable.While Republicans are more likely than not to take over the House, there are comparatively few individual seats in which they are overwhelming favorites: there are “only” 20 Democratic-held seats that the model assigns them at least a 80 percent chance of picking up, for example, and only 7 where they have at least a 90 percent chance.But a much wider list of seats — possibly as many as 90 or even 100 — could conceivably fall into Republican hands. Unless there is either a shift in Democrats’ direction between now and Nov. 2, or the polling proves to underestimate them, the party will probably either lose the House or come perilously close to doing so. They have only about a 10 percent chance of holding onto 230 or more seats in the new Congress, according to the model, which might allow them to retain a reasonably functional working majority.* * *You may notice that we’re in the process of rolling out additional detail on the House forecasts. Each contest now has its own race page, for instance, which we have released in beta form — see for example the pages for Illinois’ 10th congressional district or Florida’s 24th.In addition to charting the evolution of the forecast in each district over time, these pages also contain a list of polls, including those released by campaigns. Bear in mind as you browse these pages that local polling is but one of several inputs in our House model, and not always the most important one. In addition, the polls — particularly those released by campaigns — are subject to heavy adjustments of various kinds. We are working on various types of graphics that will convey a more comprehensive view of how our forecasts are calculated.

4917	 1990	a	The space shuttle Atlantis pierced a cloud-strewn night sky with fire and thunder early today as it lifted off on a secret military mission.The shuttle, lighting the sky from horizon to horizon with the whitish-yellow glow of its powerful booster rockets, carried a five-man crew into orbit on what was expected to be a four-day flight to deploy a large satellite to spy on the Soviet Union.Liftoff at 2:50 A.M. from the Kennedy Space Center came after five previous delays caused by adverse weather, illness of a crew member and the malfunction of a ground-based tracking computer.Showers Delay CountdownThe countdown for the flight was held up while a line of showers passed over the space center. It was quickly resumed when weather forecasters and an astronaut circling the area in a jet determined that skies were clear enough for a safe launching.
3276	 2000	a	Under a little-known financial agreement with the magazine industry, the Office of National Drug Control Policy has indirectly encouraged magazines to include antidrug messages in their editorial content.An article in the online magazine Salon yesterday reported that six magazines -- U.S. News & World Report, The Sporting News, Family Circle, Seventeen, Parade and USA Weekend -- have benefited from a media campaign the drug policy office put in place during the last year, providing financial incentives to magazines for content that the office considers sympathetic to its antidrug message.The arrangement partly mimics one that existed with the television industry. Until late January, White House drug policy officials were given advance viewings of more than 100 episodes on all the major TV networks. If the government approved a particular show that featured an antidrug message, the network programming it received credit that reduced the number of expensive public service announcements it was required by law to broadcast.The White House was allowed to review some scripts and advance footage of television shows including ''E.R.,'' ''Beverly Hills 90210'' and ''Cosby.'' After Salon reported the arrangement in January, the office said it would no longer collaborate with the networks in that manner.

6049	 1977	a	WASHINGTON, June 2—The House, considering a bill to establish a Department of Energy, defeated a major proposal of the Carter Administration by refusing today to give the head of the new department the authority to set natural gas prices.Republicans, who argued that the move would give one man too much power, voted overwhelmingly In support of an amendment that would put that pricing authority in a new independent Federal commission.There was no major opposition to the concept of a single department to deal with the nation's energy problems, but the vote on this amendment showed that the House, like the Senate earlier, had reservations about a sweeping grant of power over natural gas pricing, on which the Administration's policy is regarded as unclear.With a long list of amendments before it, the House could not complete work on the bill tonight, but was expected to pass it tomorrow. It will then go to a conference with the Senate, which adopted a somewhat different price‐setting mechanism.

6259	 1973	a	The committee's statement covers a wide range of problem areas in undergraduate education, from fiscal planning to decision‐making procedures to the role of students in shaping policy.But the tuition proposal seemed certain to attract the most attention and argument. As the report put it:“The committee is fully aware of the controversial nature, particularly within the academic community, of any recommendation to raise the tuitions of public institutions to approximately 50 per cent of instructional costs.”The committee's main arguments for financing shifts are social. The present low‐tuition structure at public institutions, it maintains, amounts to governmental subsidy of middleincome and wealthy students who should be required to pay more, and thus a diversion of funds from those who are poorest.The report acknowledges the benefits to society of higher education and says they justify some subsidy for most students. But it adds:“Nevertheless, because of the benefits of education to the individual, we consider it appropriate for students and their families to pay as large a part of the cost as they can afford.”The report was presented at a news conference in Washington's Sheraton‐Carlton Hotel by W. D. Eberle, President Nixon's I special representative for trade negotiations and chairman of the Committee for Economic Development subcommittee that conducted the college study; Alfred C. Neal, president of the committee, and Sterling M. McMurrin, dean of the graduate school of the University of Utah and the study's project director.The three stressed that the increases in tuition recommended in the report should not go into effect until adequate grant and loan systems were in operation.Mr. McMurrin, a former United States Commissioner of Education, disagreed with the tuition‐increase part of the report because of its heavy reliance on loans for students not poor enough to qualify for outright grants.
4248	 1995	a	With a .250 winning percentage, the Islanders came into tonight's game with the 25th-best record in the 26-team National Hockey League. At .295, the Ottawa Senators were ranked No. 23.In a game worthy of both teams and both records, before 8,167 enablers, the Islanders survived a late Senator surge and escaped with a 5-3 victory.The crowd, in a building that seats 10,575, was the smallest home gathering in the four-year history of the Senators, but none of the Islanders seemed to mind. They probably would have been happy to stay and play them again and again. The Senators have not won in their last 12 games, and only 1 of them was a tie.When Coach Mike Milbury was asked to discuss the Islanders' next game, which will be Saturday against the Devils, Milbury replied: "No. We don't have too many to enjoy. Even though we had to hang on at the end, it was good."

5837	 1984	a	HALF MOON STREET: Two ShortNovels. By Paul Theroux. 219 pages.Houghton Mifflin. $14.95. Lauren Slaughter is disappointed in London. As the protagonist of ''Doctor Slaughter,'' the longer of the two novellas in Paul Theroux's latest work of fiction, ''Half Moon Street,'' Lauren finds that London isn't London. ''She had not seen anything here that she had expected, and after a month she had seen too much that she had never expected,'' including the frozen toilet in her Brixton bedsitter, which a plumber repairs in exchange for Lauren's sexual favors.Worse, despite her Ph.D., her knowledge of Chinese and her job as a Persian Gulf expert at the Hemisphere Institute of International Studies, Lauren is not a success. She is not one of the 5,000 that a man at an Institute dinner party identifies as the real population of the world. ''That's official,'' the man says. ''I am speaking of reality.'' ''Yes,'' says Lauren, ''in reality there are a billion people in China.'' ''Wrong,'' says the man. ''There are two people in China. I know both of them.''So Lauren Slaughter takes a second job. After working hours at the Institute, she becomes an ''escort'' for the Jasmine Agency, which means that for a fee of a few hundred pounds she provides her ''companionship'' to various men for the evening. It's a long way from Culpeper, Va., where Lauren grew up. But at last she seems to have found a way of making it in London.Gerald DeMarr, hero of ''Doctor DeMarr,'' the other novella in ''Half Moon Street,'' hates not London, nor even his hometown of Boston, where his story is set, but rather his twin brother, George, whom he sees as an ''ugly parody'' of himself. So when George shows up after years of silence, asking for ''a place to stay for a while,'' Gerald gives him a week and takes off for his cottage on the Cape.

2046	 2007	a	I always knew I was special. And now research from San Diego State University proves that I am just as unique as everybody else: I and my collegiate peers are 30 percent more narcissistic than the fluffy-haired and spandex-clad college students of 1982.I’m not sure how something like this is measured, but apparently our inflated self-confidence follows us into the workplace. In an article entitled “The Most-Praised Generation Goes to Work” [$], Jeffrey Zaslow of The Wall Street Journal explores this “culture of praise,” noting an increase in the need for approval among workers in their 20s and the hiring of corporate “celebration assistants,” who help teach managers to compliment young employees with encouraging e-mail, prizes and “public displays of appreciation.”Now, I enjoy a compliment on a job well done; no one likes to go unnoticed. But I don’t know that I require more praise than older people in order to perform the same level of work.It may be true that our parents tended to over- rather than under-praise us. But I suspect that it is simply feedback, rather than praise, that my age group craves. I can’t speak for more than a handful of my friends and myself, but I know that I feel anxious when I have no inkling of how I’m doing. Growing up with the Internet embedded in my daily life, I’m used to hearing from people constantly. When I hear nothing, my hyper-connected self assumes that I’m performing at a mediocre level, if not doing something wrong.Online, everything is instantaneously judged. Anyone who has access to a computer has a voice, and everyone’s opinion can be recorded. Being able to post amateur photographs or writing and receive comments from anonymous readers in Japan and Kansas contributes to an inflated ego.Yet a touch of cynicism taints the complimentary experience. In a world where people can become famous by videotaping themselves stuffing a record number of marshmallows into their mouths, it’s hard to take praise seriously. Public attention and affection seems to be shifting away from the accomplished and toward the abnormal.The striking downside to an institutionalized celebration assistant is that workers may no longer feel unique or singled out for their work. If it’s someone’s job to tell you that you’re fabulous, and if your cubicle-mates are also regularly showered with confetti, the praise rings hollow. Specific, content-driven feedback is what we need, not praise for simply showing up to work or performing a basic job requirement.Do employers truly consider us thinner-skinned than previous generations? I think we’re merely more high-strung. With colleges graduating more and better-educated students than in years past, the competition for even entry-level positions can be fierce. It’s become increasingly difficult to turn down any opportunities that fall in front of us. So we’re taking on responsibilities earlier in our lives than our elders did.A good friend who had an internship the summer leading up to his senior year received a job offer starting in the fall, when he was still busy completing his last semester of schoolwork. As he thumbed through his Blackberry after – and frequently during – class, his furrowed brow and frazzled demeanor belied his image as a calm professional. In fact, he felt trapped by his opportunity; he couldn’t turn it down, regardless of the toll it took on his personal life.The weight of responsibilities like these adds up, as each one is precariously balanced. While we’re building our platforms to become the Professional American 2.0, taking on the jobs that society offers, maybe we need reassuring feedback in order to cope.Is a little bit of ego-stroking too much to ask?

1359	 2011	a	In this edition: one pundit’s serious candidate is another pundit’s long-shot flake.ReactionsThe field of candidates fighting for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination is mostly settled — if it were made out of Jell-O, we would almost be ready to take it out of the fridge. Accordingly, the debate has pretty much moved past the “who will run” question (except for Rick Perry and Sarah Palin). But we’re not ready to answer the “who will win” question. First, the question of “who can win” must be asked, and no one seems to agree on an answer.Going against the conventional wisdom, The New Republic’s Jonathan Chait has argued that the campaign of Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, is doomed to fail, mortally wounded by “Romneycare.” But, in part because of FiveThirtyEight’s analysis, Mr. Chait upgraded Mitt Romney’s campaign from “dead” to “mostly dead.” (Even if you don’t care about Mr. Romney’s electoral pulse, Mr. Chait’s post is still worth visiting if for no other reason than that it includes a clip of the Billy Crystal scene from The Princess Bride).Mr. Chait notwithstanding, there is general agreement that Mr. Romney can win. The same cannot be said about Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota. FiveThirtyEight ranked her as one of the top four contenders for the nomination. But that ranking didn’t sit well with a bar patron in the beginning of a great article in The New Yorker by John Cassidy that looks at Ms. Bachmann’s candidacy.Disagreement has also been rife over the chances of the former Minnesota governor, Tim Pawlenty. After a poor showing in the The Des Moines Register’s first poll of the cycle, some analysts moved Mr. Pawlenty down into the second tier of Republican candidates. Nate, however, cautioned against putting too much stock into that first poll. Slate’s David Weigel concurred.Perhaps the greatest discord is over the prospects of Jon M. Huntsman Jr., former governor of Utah. The great Huntsman debate of 2011 has been raging for weeks. Is he a top-tier contender? Is he conservative enough to win over G.O.P. primary voters? No and no were the answers from Nate. Outside the Beltway’s Doug Mataconis came down on Nate’s side of the fence.But straddling that fence was Politico, buying into the Huntsman hype, then mocking it.And finally, Nate already talked about the reaction to his article contrasting the leadership styles of President Obama and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York. Specifically, Nate addressed some criticisms of the post made by Matt Yglesias, the blogger for Think Progress. The Washington Post’s Ezra Klein said he “lines up most directly” with Mr. Yglesias. Mr. Klein wrote, “In the end, major social change can be accelerated by political skill and delayed by political ineptitude. But whether it happens or not is rarely a story that governors or presidents ultimately control.”ReadsAt The New Republic, Alex Klein dissects the political futures market Intrade and finds some major flaws.This Sunday’s issue of The New York Times Magazine has a beautiful graphic showing how often the Major League Baseball team with the highest payroll wins the World Series.The Post’s Ezra Klein put together an eye-opening post on what would happen to the nation’s balance sheet if Congress took a 40-year vacation.
4836	 1991	a	President Bush will extend formal recognition to Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia on Monday regardless of whether the Soviet legislature acts to grant Baltic independence by then, Administration officials said today.The officials said that although Mr. Bush had been withholding formal recognition of the three republics, out of deference to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, he had decided that he is giving Soviet legislators enough time to act."We wanted to give them a respectable grace period so if we had to act on our own, nobody could complain that we did it precipitously," one official said.The American officials' comments today appeared to be a clear effort to prod Soviet legislators. The Soviet Congress of People's Deputies meets in Moscow on Monday. It would have a full working day to act even if Mr. Bush were to make such an announcement as early as mid-morning on Monday here, because Moscow time is seven hours ahead of Eastern Daylight Time.

5666	 1985	a	The Federal authorities have subpoenaed the guest list for a party held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art on Dec. 15, the night a painting was believed to have been stolen.The art work was last seen by a security guard at 7 P.M. on Dec. 15, propped against a wall in a gallery used for storage.At that time, 120 people, including the Mayor of Philadelphia, W. Wilson Goode, and some of the city's best- known black judges, doctors, lawyers and businessmen, were attending a formal cocktail party in the museum's Great Hall.The men's room used by guests is between the Great Hall and the gallery where the painting was stored.
5367	 1987	a	As Mikhail S.

One diplomat said that on at least two frequencies the broadcast could be easily understood. On other frequencies, the speech was drowned by static.Listeners in Leningrad reportedly received the President's message clearly.Mr. Reagan decided to beam his message to the Soviet Union by radio over the Voice of America after the Soviet Union rejected a White House proposal for an exchange of televised New Year's messages between Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev.Soviet spokesmen said such an exchange would be inappropriate in light of what they described as a poor state of relations between the two countries, notably over the issue of arms control.

2296	 2006	a	If you're a secret service agent reaching for the red telephone, relax. My brother is one of the gentlest men I've ever met. But he knows his neighbors - not just the ones who live next door, but also the virtual homelander community that's scattered coast to coast. He surfs the right-wing-media scrum on a daily basis, the blog sites, the AM radio and Fox News blather-fests. He hears the hatred, the viciousness, and the unreason. "I hate that stuff," he admits. "All the mocking and the lack of civility. It's nutty how some conservatives talk. Just like it's nuts how liberals talk about George Bush. But that's how people feel."It's late summer, and we've been driving for a week through southwestern Kansas, down across the interlocking panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas, dipping into New Mexico. For blue state types this is enemy territory, the undiluted heart of red America. For a hundred miles in any direction, the culture war is over. The Democratic Party has dried up and blown away.A woman down in Texas told me, with a kind of superstitious awe of seeing a single Democratic sign in some poor fool's yard during the 2004 campaign, "It's like putting a bull's-eye on your property. If you ever told people you were a Democrat, like at a party or something, they'd think you were just plain crazy."Most of the things that stick in the craw of conservatives are either nonexistent or invisible here. The nearest abortion clinic is half a day's drive north, in Wichita, Kansas. Gays and lesbians who live in this part of the country are tolerated, for the most part, so long as they keep their sexuality to themselves. "Of course we have gay people here, too," says David Scott, chairman of the Republican committee in Ochiltree County, Texas, "but it's sort of Don't ask, Don't tell. They're treated well, but they're not marching down the streets either."In some of these sprawling counties, nine out of ten voters chose George Bush to be their president, and they would do it again in a heartbeat. In summer 2005, as Allen, the boys, and I road-tripped through homelander America, Bush's approval rating was plummeting in much of the nation, battered by Iraq and endless scandals, but his rural base was unperturbed. One survey found that the president's popularity was actually growing in a half-dozen homelander states, up 25 percent in Utah, up 11 percent in Idaho, and up 5 percent in Oklahoma.In this parallel America, the New York Times and CNN feel as remote and irrelevant as the Village Voice or Le Figaro. The radio dial offers a scratchy drone of conservative and evangelical chatter, delivered with complacent, easy-going certainty. These are the voices of men preaching to a vast, far-flung choir. With Rush and Dr. Dobson scripting the libretto, the music of rural America is scored by a parade of puff-chested country-and-western singers, thanking God for their families and the U.S.A."I'm just a singer of simple songs," croons Alan Jackson. "I'm not a real political man. I watch CNN, but I'm not sure I can tell you the difference between Iraq and Iran. But I know Jesus, and I talk to God ..."Advertisement Continue reading the main storyAfter six days of this stuff, even David is tired of it, or maybe he's just eager to dust off one of his corny jokes: "If you play country music backward," he says, "your wife comes back, your boat's fixed, and your truck'll start running." And maybe homelanders will start voting for Democrats again.The occasional jangle of a Spanish-language tejano station begins to sound downright transgressive. It hints at far-off things, at impending change, like the rumbling of a thunderstorm on the horizon. And things are changing. This isn't a fair sample of modern America, not by a long shot. The Rockies rise out that way somewhere, and the Pacific slope stretches beyond with its vast suburban metroplexes. In the opposite direction, back East, there are cities so dense and byzantine that at this remove they resemble biological organisms.Somewhere on this continent there are three hundred million people, a dizzying mix of different races and creeds and faiths, a crackling Internet, Starbucks, skyscrapers. But here there is only the humbling imperative of land and emptiness. It's so profound, so global in scope, that it reduces all the rest of creation to myth and figment.Allen points ahead at a punctuation, a shape of light on the rim of the world. Grain silos anchor hundreds of these midwestern towns, rising bleached and massive like Mexican cathedrals. Their bulk suggests a hidden bounty, dispersed like manna over the emptiness. The two kids, David and my own son, Nicholas, stir with restless energy. "How long until we get there?" Nicholas asks. "Can we get hamburgers?"His cousin is a political junkie, but at age ten my boy is baffled by this whole enterprise. Drive around asking people their opinions? Strike up conversations with complete strangers about politics? He thinks the whole thing is nuts. "You know what you think, Papa. And you know they don't agree with you.""That's why I'm curious about their ideas," I tell him. "I want to know why they think the way they do.""But you're not going to change your mind, are you?""No, probably not. Not much anyway.""Are they?""I doubt it."Nicholas is unconvinced. So is Allen, to be honest. He has gamely agreed to play the role of rural conservative, the red yin to my blue yang, but he's a little nervous. "You just can't make me look like a bumbling idiot," he says.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyIt's a reasonable enough concern. Metros have made a sport of denigrating rural Americans. Even as they lose battle after battle, urban pundits and politicians continue to dismiss homelanders as bumbling hicks, too stupid or misguided to look out for their own welfare. "People getting their fundamental interests wrong is what American political life is all about," Frank writes on the first page of What's the Matter with Kansas? "This species of derangement is the bedrock of our civic order; it is the foundation on which all else rests."The day after the 2004 election, London's Daily Mirror published a front-page banner that was adopted as a talking point by millions of American metros: "How can 59,054,087 Americans be so dumb?"There is practically a sub-genre of urban punditry that aims to diagnose GOP supporters like my brother. Depending on whom you ask, they are racists, neurotic failures, or morons. One scholarly paper widely circulated on the Internet (it served as the basis for an article in the on-line magazine Slate) attempted to identify the "specific variables that have been hypothesized to predict conservatism." The motivating factors included fear, aggression, "intolerance of ambiguity," and (my personal favorite) "anxiety arising from mortality salience."Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The official-looking chart, later debunked, ranked Kerry voters at 100-115 IQ points, while slatternly Bush voters drooled along in the 85-100 point range. It received half a million hits in a single day and was fodder for articles in The Economist and Florida's St. Petersburg Times.In March 2006 a University of California-Berkeley researcher published a paper in the Journal of Research in Personality claiming that whiny, insecure children grow up to be conservatives with right-wing traditional values. "The confident kids turned out liberal and were still hanging loose, turning into bright, non-conforming adults with wide interests," wrote Kurt Kleiner in a Toronto Star article that circulated widely on metro blog sites. "[The study] reasons that insecure kids look for the reassurance provided by tradition and authority, and find it in conservative politics.""One of the biggest changes in politics in my lifetime," argued progressive journalist Bill Moyers, in a speech after the 2004 election, "is that the delusional is no longer marginal. It has come in from the fringe, to sit in the seat of power in the Oval Office and in Congress. When ideology and theology couple, their offspring are not always bad but they are always blind. And there is the danger: voters and politicians alike, oblivious to the facts."This kind of fear and distrust is widespread in metro culture. When I began work on this project, a common objection voiced by friends and colleagues was that homelanders were simply too backward to warrant serious scrutiny. "I think you're taking this multiculturalism thing too far," a fellow writer told me. "Sometimes certain cultural values are just wrong. Maybe even evil."I asked him for an example and after a pause, he said, "Genital mutilation. Or genocide.""No, I mean give me an example of something evil that conservative rural Americans are doing."He thought for a long time. I could see that he was determined to produce clear evidence that homelanders were as dangerous and threatening as a band of cannibals. "Supporting the war in Iraq," he said finally. "And pushing millions of Americans into poverty. And the deliberate erosion of civil liberties. And the separation of church and state."Advertisement Continue reading the main storyAll of which struck me as valid concerns, especially in an era when the Democratic Party offered only a token counterweight to the Republicans. But there's a sizable gulf between the Patriot Act and the Beer Hall Putsch, a lot of ideological bandwidth between picketing a Planned Parenthood clinic and genital mutilation."My idea," I said, testing it on another colleague, "is to look for the people and institutions that are disseminating these traditional ideas. I don't mean the screamers. I want to find intellectuals, writers and thinkers who are shaping the movement. I want to find communities where these principles are being applied. Let's see how well they work."A skeptical silence followed. "Well, take creationism," I said. "It's inching its way into textbooks now. Tens of millions of Americans believe in it, including my own nephews. Nineteen states are talking about downgrading evolution in science classes, describing it as a theory on a par with intelligent design. So where does that stuff come from? How does it fit into in people's lives? There must be someone in the conservative community who's really thought deeply about this stuff.""What if there's not?""What do you mean?""Do you really think you'll find someone who can defend that nonsense in a thoughtful way?""But conservatives have universities now. They have think tanks and journalists. They can't all just be lunatics and propagandists.""What if they are? George Bush is their leader, and he's not exactly a thoughtful guy. It seems to me that the Right is made up of a few very bad and manipulative people and a lot of very stupid and gullible people."This from a friend who is worldly and thoughtful and as open-minded as anyone I've ever met. He would never dream of talking dismissively about a traditional society in Africa, say, or Central America. The difference, of course, is that those rural tribesmen can't vote in our elections. They don't make decisions that affect our urban-centric lives. They can't tell us who we can marry. They can't tap our phones. They can't send our kids off to war.This sort of fear and loathing has made it difficult for metros to understand what they're up against: not a group of crazy, Bible-thumping zealots but smart, aggressive political activists with a coherent agenda. Republican strategist Bill Greener often serves as a consultant on rural political campaigns. He shakes his head at urban America's sneering assessments of the homelander movement, delivered (as he describes it) "in the tone of 'What's wrong with these people?' I don't think that does the Democratic Party any favors," he says.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyCertainly not with voters like Allen, who fumed for days after Howard Dean dismissed Republicans as "pretty much a white, Christian party" and complained that conservatives had "never made an honest living in their lives." Dean later said that he was talking about GOP leaders, not rank and file voters, and he complained that his words had been taken out of context. But for many homelanders, the flap was proof that top Democrats don't respect rural issues or cultural values. "That is the thing that sticks under my skin more than anything else: the level of condescension I often feel," Allen says, "when I'm talking to somebody and express a conservative viewpoint and they think that I must be a complete idiot for having those viewpoints. It's almost like a kick in the gut. You know that whatever you say the gulf between you and them is so vast that there's no way to even have the conversation. I want to feel like the positions of my people are respected."The first signs of civilization on the outskirts of Guymon, Oklahoma, are a truck stop, a trailer park, and an empty cattle yard. Towns out here have the quality of settlements along some tenuous trade route. The houses are modest, the brick streets wide enough for a military parade. The sidewalks feel empty.There are churches everywhere, some big and cocky looking but most of them modest and spare. God is ubiquitous in this country, on billboards, on the radio, even on the editorial pages of local newspapers, which often offer daily passages from Scripture. In my notebook there is a quote copied down from the top of a roadside picnic table: "The best drug of all is when Jesus calls." The words were carved with deliberate, calligraphic neatness into the pine planking, next to mustard stains and etchings of phalluses. "If you listen, you can hear. Jesus is with you everywhere."For those of us from the other America, from the realm of cities and suburbs, rush hours and Google-enhanced globalization, homelander culture feels strange and arid. We suspect that there are pieces missing, as if the concept of a society had been sketched out quickly in rough draft, with the details and subtlety and nuance to be added later.The people, too, seem improbably spare, their hearts filled with blunt notions of patriotism and kinship and the Holy Gospel. They believe that certain things are right and proper and certain other things just aren't.This kind of thing offends the urban sensibility. Perhaps it's no surprise that city folk who encounter it so often respond with irony or flat-out scorn. "The tailgates groan with huge coolers, and groan even more when proud, gigantic rear ends are added," wrote Christopher Hitchens in Vanity Fair, after a reportorial dip into the rural culture of Virginia. "Should you desire to remove the right to bear arms from these people, you might well have to prize away a number of cold, dead, chubby fingers." . . .

Until shortly before her death she continued to advise on the production of ''Steal This Movie,'' a film produced by Robert Greenwald that is scheduled for release next summer. It is based on letters she had exchanged with her husband during the six years he was sought by the F.B.I. on charges of selling cocaine. The exchanges appeared in a book, ''To America With Love: Letters from the Underground,'' not long before Mr. Hoffman committed suicide at 52 in 1989.After Mr. Hoffman, the founder of the Yippie movement, jumped bail in 1974, Mrs. Hoffman and her son, america, who was deliberately named with a lower case a, became the objects of constant F.B.I. surveillance. For his part, Mr. Hoffman traveled in the United States and Europe and eventually settled with his companion, Johanna Lawrenson, in a remote hamlet in New York near the Thousand Islands, where under the name of Barry Freed he campaigned to protect the St. Lawrence River.Fully aware of his relationship with Ms. Lawrenson, his wife wrote regularly and supportively, at one point helping him to find a psychiatrist to treat him for what was later described as schizophrenia and manic depression.

4787	 1991	a	We were loading lunches, rods and tackle into my skiff by the glare of the car's headlights. The weather was deteriorating. I turned on the marine weather on the skiff's radio and learned that we were in a tropical disturbance and that a hurricane plane had been sent out to view the center of it. George Anderson and Jimbo Meador were my companions, two men who never confuse angling with male bonding: fine dining and gentlemanly hours were out the window. We had fueled up at the dock instead of siphoning gas from the rental car with a borrowed garden hose, as George and I had done in the past. We were going to look for tarpon in a new place, a stretch of south Florida beach, a deep pass, broad, sandy banks that looked ready to receive spring migrants. We had a watermelon in the ice box, sandwiches, a couple of gallons of water. With George aboard, this would be all there was to eat until the last drop of gas had been burned looking for fish.George had tied up a supply of leaders, cautioning us to lubricate our knots with Chap Stick instead of spit. "Use spit and you overheat these co-polymers. You break off a lot of fish." George had been chasing tarpon so long this spring in the Keys that he had tendinitis from pulling up leader knots. Jimbo had never caught a tarpon before and right now it was the only thing in the world he cared about. I had made a blind guess that this area would hold fish, but I wasn't really sure.I eased the skiff up onto a plane. The quartering chop was coming at us from the southeast and the boat pounded up sheets of spray that stung our faces. I strained into the darkness ahead of the semi-airborne skiff, trying to remember any obstructions that might lie in front of us. "I remember this old boy from Baldhead Island," came Jimbo's Alabama drawl above the wind, "going from Southport across the Cape Fear River headed from Frying Pan Shoals, I guess. . . .""What about him?" I hollered."Well, he hit something in the dark. Found him dead in his skiff."I looked even harder into the blackness ahead, picking out a few lighted markers, a few house lights along the shore, the lights of a barge and then a tug. We didn't realize what a lee we'd enjoyed until we got around the island. The wind was gusting up to 25 knots and prospects for fly fishing were bleak.

3419	 1999	a	In a new world order that is melding Wall Street and Silicon Valley, the business of buying and selling stocks for smaller investors is being shaped as much by lesser-known on-line brokerage firms as it is by the big brand-name firms.While Charles Schwab & Company and E*Trade have established themselves as the most recognizable on-line names, the fastest-growing firms are Waterhouse Securities, a discount broker turned on-line provider that does relatively little advertising, and Datek Online, a broker that caters to what some in the business call ''hyperactive traders.''And that, analysts say, is another hint that when it comes to the retail market -- that is, smaller investors -- the shape of things to come may be trickling up from below.''All the big Wall Street firms are looking at how these companies are shaping on-line trading,'' said Bernard L. Madoff, a member of the Securities Industry Association, which represents many of the big investment houses. ''Nobody at this point can or should ignore it; it's not a passing fancy.''
4253	 1994	a	Keeping 'He' in GodThe latest battle over how much traditional religious language should change to accommodate modern sensibilities has been fought before the nation's Roman Catholic bishops.Tradition won.The bishops recently voted, for example, to stick with the version of Psalm 98 in the King James translation of the Bible that includes this verse:"O sing unto the Lord a new song; for He hath done marvelous things: His right hand and His holy arm, hath gotten Him the victory."In doing so, they rejected the updated version that went like this: "Sing a new song to the Lord who has worked wonders; whose right hand and holy arm have brought salvation."The rejected changes were incorporated in "The Grail Psalter (Inclusive Language Version)," a revision that, in various forms, has been debated before the National Conference of Catholic Bishops for a decade but has never been authorized for use. A psalter is a translation of the Book of Psalms that is sung or read during church services. The new translation, written by a committee of scholars and translators, uses sex-neutral language, trying to avoid "He" for God or "man" for humanity.

4229	 1995	a	"Halloween is not really remembered for religious associations, and that makes it available for wider celebration," said Leigh Eric Schmidt, a professor of religion at Princeton University and author of a recent book, "Consumer Rites: The Buying and Selling of American Holidays."In addition, Mr. Schmidt said: "There's this attempt to create an American calendar out of a hodgepodge of traditions. There's this desire to create national traditions -- this hope and vision of unity. It's a deep national impulse."In the case of Halloween, it has bred some unwanted consequences. School administrators in New York City said that many junior high and high school students treat the day as a de facto holiday, in some cases because they fear the pranks of peers and in others because they plan pranks of their own, and that attendance dips discernibly each Halloween.School officials said they do not have precise statistics from past years and do not know how many children stayed out of school yesterday. But in a sign of concern, Francine Goldstein, the director of the Board of Education's Division of Student Support Services, sent letters to principals last week reminding them that Halloween is not a school holiday.But in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn, groups of high school students gathered in Marine Park yesterday during school hours to dig large trenches in which they hoarded crates of eggs to throw at passing cars. In one group, the boys were dressed in elaborate coveralls of rain gear, hockey masks and asbestos-removal uniforms as a defense from others throwing eggs at them.Some schools around the country, particularly in the South, have abandoned Halloween decorations and discussions in deference to conservative Christian parents, who have voiced concern that the holiday promotes satanism.But some experts said that the whiff of controversy is much more a sign that Halloween has truly arrived than a signal that Halloween is on the way out.
2947	 2002	a	Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz warned America's allies in Asia today to keep their guard up against terrorist activities within their borders, cautioning that even nations with large Muslim populations remain targets for attack by Islamic extremists.''I still think the terrorism problem is felt as a little bit remote, as a little bit America's problem,'' Mr. Wolfowitz told reporters traveling with him to a three-day regional security conference here that ends on Sunday. ''It's not just America's problem. The targets also very explicitly include the 500 million Muslims who live in the Pacific Rim.''Mr. Wolfowitz, a former ambassador to Indonesia, said he intended to use his stature as the highest-ranking Pentagon official to visit Southeast Asia since the Sept. 11 attacks to underscore that the Bush administration's long-term goals in the capaign against terror extended well beyond Afghanistan.''Perhaps, they may not realize quite how committed the United States is or quite how long we expect this to take,'' Mr. Wolfowitz said, referring to Asian allies, a few hours before separate meetings with military officials from Indonesia, Singapore and India.
4703	 1992	a	To the Sports Editor:"Football the Way It Oughta Be Played" (The Times, Oct. 2) made this Columbia man stand up and cheer. I played in 1939-41, and graduated in 1942. October 31 was our 50th reunion homecoming game against Princeton. My team's last game, against Princeton, was played at Princeton in 1941. We won, 21-0, and our three touchdowns were scored by three men worth remembering: Paul Governali, an all-American and the Maxwell Award winner; Phil Bayer, who scored the winning touchdown against Georgia in 1940 and a Marine killed in action on Palau in 1944, and Stewart McIlvennen, a 170-pound fullback, basketball captain, recently retired lawyer and the only survivor of the three.George Vecsey has found something fresh and positive in college football. We should also thank him for for helping us to remember the right stuff. JACK ARBOLINO Harrington Park, N.J.
2520	 2004	a	Correction AppendedNine years ago, Rachel Morris and her two partners at the Stencil Library, a British company, attacked their 14-room farmhouse in North Umberland and didn't stop until they had embellished every surface, right down to the carpets. ''You can get hooked on it,'' Ms. Morris said. Today they design and sell thousands of patterns, mosaics, borders, silhouettes and alphabets, in themes like Celtic or Bad Attitude.

DEBORAH BALDWINCorrection: January 8, 2004, Thursday A brief report in the Currents column last Thursday about the Stencil Library, a British company, misspelled the name of the English county where its partners decorated a farmhouse with their patterns. It is Northumberland, not North Umberland.

4396	 1994	a	Responding to Russian complaints of rude treatment by consular officers at the American Embassy here, Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said today that he had taken steps to improve the visa application process.Mr. Pickering said he had brought in specialists to monitor the "comportment and deportment" of officers as they conducted interviews, as well as Russian-language experts to study their "use of language."Mr. Pickering said the embassy had introduced an express line for some applicants to speed the process and to make it less stressful. In an experiment, a handful of accredited tourist agencies will be allowed to apply for visas for their business travelers, he added.To underwrite some of the costs of a new computer system for issuing and checking visas, the State Department has begun charging Russians a $20 fee for each application, effective today. Up to now the visas had been free. A single-entry visa now costs $20, while a multi-entry visa costs $120.
287	 2017	a	The actor Mark Rylance, the opera singer Bryn Terfel, the Kinks singer Ray Davies, the Vogue editor Anna Wintour and the war photographer Don McCullin are all on this year’s New Year’s Honors 2017, the eagerly awaited list of awards given by the British Cabinet Office to reward service in a variety of professional and charitable fields.The Honors List was first established by King George V in 1917 as a way of recognizing achievement for fields other than those coming from the military, diplomatic corps or the aristocracy. (This year includes awards for “service to Plant and Bee Health” and “For services to Tackling Tax Non-Compliance and Tax Avoidance.”) The awards, which are given twice a year, are formally called the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, and include Knights and Dames, followed by CBE (Commander of the British Empire), OBE (Officer of the British Empire) and MBE (Member of the British Empire).Mr. Rylance, Mr. Terfel, Mr. Davies and Mr. McCullin all received knighthoods, entitling them to the honorific Sir, while Ms. Wintour and the actress Patricia Routledge received damehoods. Among other arts figures, the theater director Rupert Goold received a CBE, and the Oscar-winning costume designer Jenny Beavan received an OBE, as did the fashion designer Victoria Beckham, the artist Patrick Brill (known as Bob and Roberta Smith) and the actress Naomie Harris. The theater director Richard Eyre and the percussionist Evelyne Glennie, who are already a knight and dame, were made Companions of Honor, a special award for service of national importance.Sportsmen and women weren’t neglected: The tennis player Andy Murray and the distance runner Mo Farah were awarded knighthoods and Jessica Ennis-Hill, the 2012 Olympic Heptathlon champion, was awarded a damehood.
2943	 2002	a	Political surveys suggest the issue has not become a major concern for most New Yorkers. Indeed, some drivers, like Dr. Jonathan Epstein, an emergency medical specialist in Manhattan, seem to be taking the price increases with a shrug. ''If it goes up,'' he said, ''there's very little I can do about it. I have to have a car and I have to have insurance.''But Abby Scala, an account executive at Kay Insurance Associates, one of the biggest brokers for auto and home insurance in metropolitan New York, said lots of other customers are beginning to rebel.''My phone hasn't been this busy in 25 years,'' she said. ''Almost everyone is calling when they get their renewal notices, asking us to shop around for better prices.''Most customers, she said, do not see auto insurance as a political problem, however. ''They blame the insurance companies,'' she said. ''They don't even think about the Legislature or the governor.''Just across the Hudson River, prices in New Jersey have been the highest in the country for several years and have been a big factor in recent gubernatorial elections. The latest data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, an umbrella group of state regulators, put the average annual cost of insuring a car in New Jersey at $1,034 in 1999, $91 more than in New York and $351 more than the national average.But Mr. Hartwig said that with prices declining in New Jersey as they are rising in New York, New York is likely soon to take the title of most expensive state. It may already have done so, he said; the statistics run two years behind the calendar, with the next report, for calendar year 2000, expected in mid- to late June.Those figures will probably show New Jersey still in the lead because fraud costs were not significantly reflected in coverage prices in New York until 2001, Mr. Hartwig said. He estimated the average cost of insuring a car in New York in 2001 was $1,080, or $100 more than in New Jersey. But that is not official. And the headlines that come with becoming No. 1 may make a big difference politically.
7480	 1964	a	Don Meade, the stormy petrel of the American turf in the days when he was the nation's jockey champion, said yesterday that his 18year ban from racing had been lifted and that he intended to apply Monday for a license to be a trainer in New York State.The 50‐year‐old former rider said he had been notified by officials in Mexico that the lifetime suspension he received there in 1945 for using profane language to track stewards was lifted on July 19.Except for five days in 1950 when the state of Florida gave him a probationary license that he later returned, the Mexican suspension has kept Meade out of racing in the United States because United States and Mexican racing bodies abide by each other's rulings.Once Meade said that he would begin a comeback, if he could win reinstatement, by returning to the saddle in Mexico. But today he said that his age was against that.
5187	 1989	a	President Bush today reluctantly signed into law a measure creating an independent inspector general within the Central Intelligence Agency.Creation of the new inspector general's office, similar to those that review other Government agencies' programs and seek out abuses, was part of a broader bill authorizing intelligence activities for the coming year.In a statement, Mr. Bush, a former Director of Central Intelligence, said the new post ''could impair the ability of the C.I.A. to collect vitally needed intelligence information by creating a perception that confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.''But the President said his objections were eased by a provision allowing the Director of Central Intelligence to kill any investigation he believed might compromise national security.
1839	 2008	a	Aired Friday night on NBC: Political experts are saying that to offset his weaknesses, Barack Obama should choose a running mate who is older, a veteran and from a different part of the country. So today, Obama chose John McCain.Yesterday, presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said that he won’t stay in the race “beyond reason.” Then Huckabee announced he’s dropping out six weeks ago.There’s a rumor that “American Idol” contestant David Hernandez used to be a gay stripper. When he heard this, Ryan Seacrest said, “I thought that guy looked familiar.”This week, the U.S. Border Patrol arrested a man responsible for smuggling thousands of Guatemalans into California. An angry American official said, “Those Guatemalans were taking jobs that should have gone to Mexicans.”In England, police report that bales of cocaine have been washing up on the beaches. Which may explain why a beached whale was spotted driving a Camaro.In a new interview, Keith Richards says that he wishes he could talk to his younger self and tell him to lay off drugs. Unfortunately, young Keith Richards can’t understand anything old Keith Richards is saying.
5487	 1987	a	The situation seems to call for a tough quarterback, and Crocicchia has credentials. He said his nose and his right little finger had been broken while boxing. Amateur boxing? ''No,'' he said. College boxing? ''No,'' he said, ''bar boxing. I took a couple of hits, but I can take care of myself. But don't make me out to be a fighter. My mother will kill me.''Before the strike, Crocicchia put off job hunting and attempted to keep in shape by running, playing tennis and trying to find pass receivers. He got some of his high school teammates to join him after they finished work and threw passes to them.''It's all coming back,'' he said. ''I feel a little ahead of the game. Some guys' heads are spinning a bit. I have a grasp. But I need fine-tuning.''Busch was back at South Dakota State, taking the 14 credits he needed for his degree, helping coach the varsity quarterbacks and wide receivers as a $500-a-season graduate assistant. He was also bagging groceries at the Hy-Vee supermarket in Brookings, S.D., for $4 an hour.Now he must take incompletes in his seven courses, and when the strike is over he will look for a new job to earn expenses. He said it was all worth it, and he cited a comment by Coach Mike Ditka of the Chicago Bears.''He said that all of us are going to be on N.F.L. rosters,'' said Busch. ''He said that's one thing they can't take away from you.'' ROSTER AT 52The Giants' roster remained at 52. Because the Giants play Monday night, they have until 4 P.M. Monday to reduce the active roster to 45. They may also declare up to 10 players inactive for that game, making them more or less a taxi squad. . . . The striking Giants called off their Wednesday-morning practice in Washington Township, N.J., because of rain. Gary Reasons lives near the field there, and the 18 players who turned up drove to his home. He briefed them on Wednesday's meeting held by Gene Upshaw, the executive director of the Players Association, with player representatives and other players.

4025	 1996	a	''If we don't get anywhere in committee,'' he said, ''then we'll try to take the fight to the floor. We think we have enough votes to do that for sure because all you need is a quarter of the platform committee or six state delegations.''In recent months, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Weld have been in contact with other party moderates about the abortion issue, among them Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey. Asked how many other governors and leading party moderates could be expected to join the fight for the substitute plank, Mr. Wilson replied, ''We'll begin to see now that we have a plank to propose.''Governor Whitman's office said she was on vacation in Alaska and would have no immediate comment.Mr. Wilson said that the Dole campaign was told earlier this week of the plan to offer the substitute, but that ''I don't know what they intend to do with it.''Mr. Dole, after considerable backing and filling, recently tried to head off any embarrassing convention split on abortion. He proposed that the party retain its long-standing anti-abortion plank but also add a tolerance plank, which would welcome party members who have ''deeply held and sometimes differing views on issues of personal conscience like abortion.''After the wording of the suggested substitute plank was released today, the Dole campaign released the following statement: ''Bob Dole's long and consistent pro-life record is as strong as his belief that the Republican Party is an inclusive party. The issue of platform language is one that will ultimately be decided by the platform committee.''
4360	 1994	a	NATIONAL FIGURES SWARM TO ALBANY RACE With the possible exception of California's gubernatorial race, no statewide election this year is drawing more attention from politicians with an eye on the 1996 Presidential election than the New York campaign, top Democratic and Republican officials say. A1. NEW YORK CITY POLICE SEEK SOURCE OF DEADLY HEROIN Searching for the supplier of a deadly blend of heroin that may have killed as many as 14 people in the last week, the police have saturated the Lower East Side of Manhattan with undercover agents and surveillance teams. B3. BILLBOARD QUITS SMOKING TO PUSH HEALTH In a head-spinning switch, a prominent billboard in Times Square that spent five years promoting cigarettes is being reborn as a central element in a crusade to encourage healthful nutrition habits among shoppers. B3. BOMB TRIAL IS POSTPONED UNTIL DECEMBER Acting over the objections of 11 defendants, a Federal judge postponed for more than two months the trial of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and 12 others accused of conspiring to wage a war of urban terrorism on the United States. B3. EMERGENCY SHELTERS WITHOUT KITCHENS Struggling to find shelter for the more than 150 homeless families who are sleeping in New York City offices each night, the city will again put homeless families in hotel rooms without kitchens because its existing shelters are full. B3. GETAWAY CAR HITS BICYCLE, KILLING A BOY A car chase through the Hollis section of Queens, with robbers in one car exchanging gunfire with a store owner in another, ended after the robbers' car struck and killed a teen-ager riding his bicycle, the police said. B3. REGION MAN SUSPECTED IN SERIAL DEATHS In the last two years, five prostitutes have been found strangled in Bridgeport, Conn. On Saturday, a man confessed to killing one prostitute that morning and trying to kill another. The police say that he may have been involved in some of the earlier killings. B6 A CHEERLEADER FOR GOVERNMENT In Connecticut, a state that has recently been fertile ground for insurgent candidates attacking the political system, John B. Larson's campaign for governor is preaching a novel message: Government works. B6. NEW ART FORM, WITH TRACTORS AS BRUSHES Norman Greig is a practitioner of a new art form, crop art. He is one of 14 farmers in Dutchess County, N.Y., who have created large images and sculptures on their farms. B6. MALL POSTPONES PLAN TO BAN BUSES A Connecticut shopping mall that wanted to discourage teen-agers from congregating there on weekends has temporarily dropped plans to bar buses from stopping on mall property on Friday and Saturday nights. B7. REPUBLICANS WINCE OVER DONATION A New Jersey lobbyist who wanted to go to an expensive political fund-raising reception got his client to pay the $5,000 contribution. But when a reporter told the Republican recipients who the donors were, they immediately said that the $5,000 would be returned: The contributors were owners of adult bookstores. B9. I'D LIKE TO TEACH THE WORLD . . . Rutgers University announced a $10 million deal giving the Coca-Cola Company exclusive rights to sell to about 48,000 students on its three campuses over the next decade. B9.
2040	 2007	a	How does a four-star restaurant look through the eyes of a New York teenager eating at one for the first time?I set out to find the answer with two students who weren’t happy about how I had portrayed them in an earlier story in the Dining section.They are students at Food and Finance High School, the city’s first high school dedicated to mixing culinary education and academics. Overall, I heard through their teacher, they liked the story. But a couple of things really bothered them.I started out my story by saying that Brooke Arce would not be eating at Le Bernardin any time soon. I pointed out that she, like most of her classmates, came from low-income families. But, I wrote, she might work there one day.Why, Brooke wanted to know, did I say she would work there as opposed to own it one day? And why did I have to point out income levels? She thought some of the reasons might have had to do with race. Brooke is half-African American and half-Puerto Rican. (Race had absolutely nothing to do with it, but I can see how she might interpret things that way.)They also wanted to know why in the world I picked Le Bernardin, a restaurant they had never heard of. (Simply because it was the closest four-star restaurant to their school, and one people would easily recognize.)Rebecca Rios, the other teenager in my story, wanted to know how I could spend only two days at their school and then write a story that sounded like I knew them. (Welcome to the exciting world of daily journalism.)I decided the best way to remedy the situation was to let the girls speak their minds over lunch at Le Bernardin, with a little private kitchen tour to follow.We had the best time. The girls opened my eyes to how both the world and Le Bernardin look when you’re 15 and new to both journalism and four-star dining.During lunch, they noticed things I usually don’t. Two people open the big doors leading into the restaurant. The move creates an instant transition between the street and the restaurant space that was particularly magical, they thought.“It looks like somewhere Donald Trump would eat,” said Brooke.They were in awe of how the waiters worked together so effortlessly, and got a lesson in the hierarchy of the dining room. They learned what a table captain does and why the sommelier wears a tastevin around his neck. (He said it was for tasting wine at tableside and that long ago it was used to reflect candlelight in dark cellars so sommeliers could find the right bottle.)Brooke, watching the endless plate and silverware changes, asked the waiter what happens if the dishwasher breaks. (A teacher had told her that when you own your restaurant, you end up doing everything sometimes, even washing dishes.)The answer? They have two — one just for glasses and one for everything else. If one breaks, the other can be used as a back-up. And, our waiter pointed out, if something happens they can have someone to repair it at the restaurant in 20 minutes.They loved the attention to detail. They ooohhhed over the way sauce was poured over a slice of fish tableside and loved the way waiters replaced napkins when someone went to the bathroom, or used linen to cover spilled sauce.Rebecca, who is part of an after-school catering club at her school, said the service at Le Bernardin made her realize that, while the catering club service is good, it could be better.“Everything here is so precise and systematic,” she said. “It makes everyone feel like they’re special and the service is just for you.”My young guests ordered particularly well, and like serious food students usually do, scribbled notes as every dish arrived at the table (O.K., I had given them the notebooks, but still …)After a few jokes about eating Nemo, they settled into reviewing. Brooke likes crab but hates cauliflower. That is, until she tasted a dish of warm Peekytoe and Maryland lump crab with shaved cauliflower and a light coat of Dijon emulsion. Rebecca ordered a skate wing because it had jalapeño and mango salad, two flavors she thought would go nicely together.Even the bread program impressed them. Rebecca liked how both the olive rosemary stick and a slice of fruit bread both worked with each dish.The sodas kept coming, and so did the dishes. They had their first taste of fish eggs — crunchy tobiko dyed green with wasabi – but the biggest challenge of the day was a small, black plate of braised baby octopus with a purée of black trumpet mushrooms and sauced with a wine-squid ink infusion.Rebecca bravely forked into it. She liked it!“This dish proves a point to never eat with just your eyes,” she said.Brooke was a little more reluctant. But in the name of educating her palate she acquiesced and swallowed a tentacle.“I can’t believe I am eating an octupus leg,” she said.We had a long talk about a salad of grilled bacalao, a technique that Brooke thought gave the salted cod a nice, homey flavor. Her grandmother from Puerto Rico used bacalao to make a kind of potato salad. Rebecca explained how in Mexico, she’s had the same fish with olives, chilies and tomato. It was a salted cod “We are the World” moment.“It’s all how you express yourself through an ingredient,” said Rebacca, warming up to the role of food critic.Brooke’s final assessment? “I’d give this an A plus plus, unless there is a letter before A.”We also got to learn a little something about making mistakes. One plate had a small, wing-flapping fruit fly stuck in the sauce. The girls were horrified, more out of concern for the kitchen than the bug or our pleasure. We decided to point it out to the waiter, if only for a good lesson in how to handle tough situations.The waiter whisked the plate away, apologized and got another dish out to us within minutes.Afterward, he explained that the chef would always like to know if something is wrong so he has a chance to correct it.The same goes for journalists.

5873	 1984	a	The sales tax in Suffolk County will increase a quarter of a percentage point Saturday, from 7.25 percent to 7.5 percent.As a result, an extra penny of tax will be added to every $4 worth of goods or services purchased in the county.The increase was approved by the County Legislature in September to help bail out the Southwest Sewer District and to avoid a doubling of sewer taxes for Islip and Babylon residents who live in the district.William Brotherton, the deputy county executive in charge of finance, said that most of the tax increase would be spent in the sewer district for the first two years. But he said that over the five-year life of the tax increase, nearly 40 percent of the $115 million he expects it to yield would be spent in other sewer districts to lower tax rates.

5271	 1988	a	Unusually spirited and rythmically alert Bach playing was the unifying thread of a stimulating organ recital by Kei Koito at the Church of St. John the Evangelist Monday evening.Miss Koito played four works of the Thomaskantor - an early Vivaldi concerto transcription (BWV 593), the canonic variations on ''Vom Himmel hoch'' (BWV 769), the Trio Sonata in C minor (BWV 526) and the Prelude and Fugue in E flat (BWV 552) - with brilliant contrasts of registration (almost, but never quite, gaudy) and with a motoric swing that sometimes called to mind the Bach interpretations of Glenn Gould. Miss Koito is by no means alone in her application of a lean, often non legato style to these works, but her presentation of it was particularly fresh.She played the adagio of the Vivaldi arrangement with a blunt, measured tread and hollow timbres; the variations brought singing fluency and deft ornamentation. The big final piece began with majestic pacing but in a way that remained relatively brisk and bright; the fugue was begun in severe colors that gave way to a sort of crescendo of registrational variety.Interspersed with the Bach were three new pieces, all of them announced as New York premieres. Henri Pousseur's ''Deuxieme Vue sur les Jardins Interdits'' explored contrasts of timbre and confrontations of dissonance with pastiche consonance; it seemed limited by a stop-and-go character. Episodic construction, though, did not undermine the charm of Eric Gaudibert's ''Jetees,'' a partly aleatory work of great variety; my favorite section was one in which pretty, tweety high beepings cavorted with an Alberich-like bassoon stop below. Giacinto Scelsi's ''In Nomine Lucis'' built wild-sounding tone clusters into a vague, chaotic climax and dwindled; it sounded primitive but stirring.

[Page 1, Column 8.]A noted leftist labor leader in Spain, Marcelino Camacho Abad, who was freed under an amnesty decree by King Juan Carlos I, said that he would not recognize the legitimacy of the monarchy until the Spanish people had been freely consulted and given their consent. An organizer of clandestine workers' commissions, he said defiantly that he would continue his activities. He acknowledged that this might put him back in prison, where he had spent nearly nine years. He was released with several other political prisoners.

4411	 1993	a	A Village Bistro ReopensUpon walking into the recently reopened La Gauloise in Greenwich Village, you would never guess that it had been closed for a year. The dining room still has a languid, Gallic atmosphere, with its handsome Belle Epoque bar and cozy dining room with polished wood trim, mirrored panels and soft lighting.The restaurant, on the Avenue of the Americas near 13th Street, has been revived by Steve Tzolis. the principal owner of Il Cantinori, Periyali and Aureole, all in Manhattan.Mr. Tzolis also owns the defunct Harvey's Chelsea House on West 18th Street, which he said he plans to renovate and reopen as an American restaurant.At La Gauloise, the new chef is Jean-Robert de Clavel, who was the chef at Le Regence in the Hotel Plaza Athenee in Manhattan.

5490	 1987	a	WHILE the new CBS series ''Tour of Duty'' continues tonight to exploit the Vietnam story with standard war games and buddy stories, a made-for-TV movie on ABC at 9 P.M. makes a more oblique yet considerably more powerful attack on the same subject. ''Proud Men'' is set not in Vietnam but in the American Northwest. Charlton Heston plays Charley McLeod, a weathered, tradition-steeped cattle rancher who is told he is dying. His wife, Laura (Nan Martin), phones their son, an increasingly successful photographer in France, to come home. Charley Jr., portrayed by Peter Strauss, went AWOL 15 years earlier in Vietnam.Written by Jeff Andrus, the script is uncomplicated. And the Von Zerneck-Samuels Production, directed by William Graham, is as attractively lean as an old-style western. But instead of trying to paper over a grueling experience with uplifting stories of battlefield heroics, ''Proud Men'' confronts painful realities that linger in the national psyche. The older Charley still disapproves of what his son did. He is still ashamed that his son, as he puts it, ''cut and run.'' And Charley Jr. is just as convinced that ''the thing was absurd - I swore an oath to my country, not to what was going on over there.'' Father and son are very much alike, two proud men, each convinced that he alone is right. Mr. Heston and Mr. Strauss bring them to life with strong and sensitive performances.''Proud Men'' is strewn with cliches. When, for instance, Charley reveals that he might cut his son out of his will, Mom cries: ''This land has been in the McLeod family for three generations.'' But for the most part, the more predictable moments are handled well. Upon his return, Charley Jr. discovers that a good many people in the small town are not about to forget. There is much muttering about ''traitor'' and ''yellow-belly.'' But then there is the sweet old girlfriend, already divorced, who is willing to believe that Charley Jr. acted honorably, although she was never in favor of those war protesters who seemed to be ''cheering for the other side.''When the older Charley takes a turn for the worse, Charley Jr. sends to Paris for his French wife and young son. Needless to say, the presence of his grandson, a cowboy fan, softens the old man considerably, even if the youngster can't speak English. Taking the boy out on horseback, Charley gives him a hot dog, assuring him that ''you take a bite out of that and you'll start talking American.'' In the end, the town toughs, the ones making a big issue about Charley Jr.'s ''cowardice,'' turn out to be nasty bigots against all ''outsiders.''

4772	 1991	a	Eliot Reif, the president since 1980 of the retirees association of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, died yesterday at the home of a daughter, Marilyn Cooper, in Rye, N.Y. He was 84 years old.He died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly called Lou Gehrig's disease, Mrs. Cooper said.Mr. Reif was a former president of Local 299 of the union's recreation employees division and was a member of the executive board of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, A.F.L.-C.I.O.He was a native of Manhattan, a graduate of City College and a former recreation director in New York City's Parks and Recreation Department. He served in the Army in World War II.Besides his daughter Marilyn, he leaves his wife, Anne; a second daughter, Phyllis Jacobs of Staten Island, eight grandchildren and a great-granddaughter.
2419	 2005	a	From all appearances, Or seems to have long ago assumed the role of the responsible one in the family: she collects bottles and cans for money, works as a dishwasher in a restaurant owned by a sympathetic neighbor and keeps up the family's cramped, cluttered apartment as best she can. In turn, Ruthie, recently returned from a hospital stay, behaves like one of those out-of-control adolescents who show up on cable television: she dresses like Slattern Barbie, refuses to get up in the morning, sneaks out at night, keeps bad company and whines, a lot.Shot in an unadorned style that makes everything look fairly grotty, the women included, the film mixes scenes of quotidian life with melodramatic incident, and then the whole thing grinds to a stop. Along the way, Ms. Yedaya and her co-writer, Sari Ezouz, build the case that prostitutes are purely victims and that prostitution is so pathological, so radically dehumanizing, that the prostitute herself is little more than an empty shell.In this formulation, prostitution isn't a lousy way to make a living; it's an iron cage with a rusted lock. Ruthie and Or are victims not only of poverty, male opportunism and social indifference, but also of their actions and desires, which don't really belong to them in any meaningful sense because, well, everything they do and feel is symptomatic of their pathological existence.Ms. Yedaya's take on prostitution would be tolerable if her characters, especially Ruthie, weren't such ideological constructs. A monster from her gaudy blue eye-shadow to her Frankenstein platforms, Ruthie insists on breaking her daughter's heart by turning tricks. She says they need the money, but something else clearly drives her into the streets. But because Ms. Yedaya refuses to give Ruthie a hint of a dreamscape, a moment outside that iron cage, we never learn what makes her tick.That Ruthie might get something she needs from prostitution, however unhealthy, is something the film refuses to consider; worse, there's a suggestion that Or's teenage lust is a symptom of Ruthie's pathology rather than something good and real and human. Prostitution isn't the only disease in this film; so is desire.

5499	 1987	a	rrxhAs long as Reagan evidences no qualities of an economist nor of a statesman, one will justifiably not expect any American iniative to defuse the time bomb that has been ticking away for years, until after 1989 when a new gentleman sits in the White House. Completely apart from this political influence, the uncertainty of business trends has increased sharply in the wake of the stock market crash; it will take months before one can see to what degree the global destruction of hundreds of millions in potential buying power will paralyze economic development. The financial markets must adjust to the new situation. The stock crash will without doubt stimulate the existing discussions. Neue Zurcher Zeitung ParisrrxhRonald Reagan, accused from all sides of being responsible for the worsening budgetary impasse -which, along with the United States' current account deficit, is the main element of the world's economic imbalances - has been led to open the door halfway to an eventual tax increase, a door that he had until now kept carefully closed. . . . Ronald Reagan, by accepting a meeting with Congress on that subject, acknowledged that all the economists' analyses were well-founded: the explosive combination of the American internal and external deficits calls for fast, strong-willed action. . . . The end of six years of the dialogue of the deaf between the White House and Congress on the budgetary problem was well worth saluting. . .Following the bitter Wall Street downturn, there is one other lesson: promises and overtures will no longer suffice. Stock traders want action. Will they have it? Le Monde LondonrrxhUnless his statement acknowledging the gravity of the situation is a harbinger of better things to come, the only charitable description of President Reagan's performance over the last week is that it has amply demonstrated his known limitations. Once the beneficiary of favorable circumstances, he appears to lack the capacity to handle adversity. . . There is, sadly, a fundamental inability at the top to grasp complex issues, not seen at a Presidential level since Herbert Hoover. . . . What is needed is a realization in the U.S. capital that neither the nation nor the world can wait until a new President is installed for a coherent set of policies to emerge. . . . Gramm-Rudman, for all its deficiencies, at least provides a starting point. This year's target must be met as a minimum, if government is not to cede policy-making to the markets entirely. Equally important is the recognition that a managed decline in the value of the dollar, far from demonstrating a failure of national virility, may be the least of present evils. Financial Times RomerrxhSince the stock market is ever more the metaphor of freedom in financial garb, October's catastrophe opens the way to more than a simple economic contraction. The crash is the prelude to the redimensioning of that freedom, it promises the advent of another phase in the cycle of American history. Today all signs indicate that 1987's Black Monday will bring an end to deregulation and the return to the age of public monitoring and regulations. And the wild excesses of today's Wall Street, abandoned to itself by political power, will again become a more reasonable stock market game.And it is even amusing to observe how the boom of Reagan prosperity will not turn into another depression thanks not to the self-balancing virtues of the market, which today are totally absent, but rather thanks to the social and banking safety belts set up by Franklin Roosevelt. If people still are not questioning whether banks will fail, and they don't run to collect their savings, it is because the state, through the Federal Reserve, is ready to intervene. It is in fact Roosevelt's ghost which will save America from the risks of Reagan's experiment. La Repubblica
726	 2015	a	Robo-SauceWritten by Adam Rubin. Illustrated by Daniel Salmieri.“Robo-Sauce” begins with a wise-guy voice talking to the book’s main character and saying the very same words that opened Rubin and Salmieri’s best-selling “Dragons Love Tacos”: “Hey, kid!” This time our protagonist and his dog are dressed in robot costumes made out of cardboard, and the voice first compliments him, then begins to taunt him for not being a “real robot.” The solution, he’s told, is a recipe for “robo-sauce.” The stuff is rendered in the most neon shade of orange imaginable, which Salmieri uses judiciously throughout the book, making his always delightful squiggly-lined drawings pop in whole new ways. The sauce turns the boy into the genuine article, complete with an electrical charge and an array of gizmos that can turn everyone around him into a robot, too. Amid the ensuing mayhem the voice begins to back down: “You’re supposed to realize that you miss being a human,” it whines.In the three years since “Dragons Love Tacos,” that sort of cheeky breaking down of the power dynamic between author and character has become common in picture books. So this time, Rubin and Salmieri have another trick to offer. Book-savvy children may notice that this one comes without a jacket. That’s because just as the boy-as-robot appears poised for world domination, the reader is instructed to pull out a long gatefold and follow the directions, which leads to the creation of a book jacket for an entirely new book made out of the final few pages, now by necessity viewed upside down. This new book, its title page tells us, is called “Robo-Book” and has “data by Adroid Rubot” and “images by Salmatron 5000.” There are a lot of beeps and boops, and then the glorious victory over the humans by our little robot-hero, who has converted his entire family into his own kind. It’s a gimmick, and it works beautifully, folding into all the lunacy a lesson in paper engineering. In the final image everyone is again in cardboard robot outfits, that creative staple of modern childhood.

2010	 2007	a	In the months since the Congressional elections, President Bush has lost substantial support among members of his own party, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.Mr. Bush’s approval rating dropped 13 percentage points since last fall among Republicans, 65 percent of whom now say they approve of the way he is handling his job as president, compared with 78 percent last October.Over all, Mr. Bush’s job approval remains at one of its lowest points, with 29 percent of all Americans saying they approve of the way he is doing his job, compared with 34 percent at the end of October. Sixty-one percent disapproved, compared with 58 percent in October, within the margin of sampling error.Twenty-three percent of those polled approved of the way Mr. Bush is dealing with the situation in Iraq. Twenty-five percent approved of his handling of foreign policy.Even the president’s campaign against terrorism, long his signature issue, is seen positively by only 40 percent of those polled, while 53 percent disapprove.Three-quarters of those polled say things are going badly for the United States in Iraq, and only 23 percent say the efforts to bring stability and order to Iraq are going well.Seventy percent, including 52 percent of Republicans, say there is not much the United States military can do to reduce the sectarian fighting in Iraq.Over all, 23 percent of the public say the country is going in the right direction and 68 percent consider it as having “gotten off on the wrong track.”The nationwide telephone poll was conducted Friday through Tuesday with 1,281 adults and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. The margin of sampling error for Republicans is plus or minus five percentage points. Complete results are available here. A video is available here.

2639	 2004	a	Although my recipe makes enough for 12, I wouldn't halve it. Simply freeze the six you don't want as soon as they cool, and make life easier for yourself another day. Shortcakes really have to be eaten the day they are made (if you are not freezing them), so unless you have a voracious horde coming over, it isn't worth splitting and filling the whole batch now. Besides, once you make these, you're going to have requests for them again. Now you're prepared. So sit back and enjoy the remaining bit of summer while you can.SALMON WITH THYME, LEMON BUTTER AND ALMONDS Time: 40 minutes1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 4-pound salmon, cleaned and scaled, head and tail removed 2 scallions, trimmed 1 small bunch (about 1/2 cup) fresh thyme 6 tablespoons melted butter 1 tablespoon sea salt 1/3 cup sliced almonds Juice of half a lemon.1. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Lay out a double layer of foil big enough to wrap fish in, and drizzle with oil. Place fish on foil. Put scallions and half the thyme in cavity of fish. Drizzle 2 tablespoons butter over fish, and sprinkle with salt to taste. Wrap fish loosely, place on a baking sheet and bake 35 minutes. 2. Place a small skillet over medium heat. When pan is hot, add almonds, and stir until golden brown. Remove from pan, and set aside. In a small bowl, combine remaining melted butter and lemon juice; set aside. 3. When fish is cooked, carefully peel skin from side facing you. With a knife, divide fish in three portions by making two long cuts parallel to each other and perpendicular to the backbone. Cut down to the rib bones, but do not cut through them. Remove a portion of meat by sliding a spatula over rib bones and pulling meat away; repeat with 2 remaining portions, and place on three warmed plates. Remove backbone and attached rib bones. Cut three more fillets from remaining fish, placing them on plates. 4. Drizzle lemon butter over each fillet, and sprinkle with toasted almonds. Pull leaves from remaining sprigs of thyme, and scatter over fillets. Serve immediately.Yield: 6 servings.CHOCOLATE RASPBERRY SHORTCAKES Time: 40 minutesFor the shortcakes:Vegetable oil or nonstick spray, for pan 1 2/3 cups flour 1/3 cup cocoa 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 2 tablespoons sugar 8 tablespoons (1 stick) diced chilled butter 1 large egg 1 cup sour cream 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 3 tablespoons honeyFor the filling: 1/2 cup heavy cream 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar 1 cup raspberries.1. To prepare shortcakes, heat oven to 400 degrees. Oil bottom of each cup in a 12-cup muffin pan. In a mixing bowl, combine flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and sugar. Using a pastry blender or an electric mixer, or working by hand, cut in the butter until mixture resembles damp sand. In a separate bowl, whisk together egg, sour cream, vanilla and honey. Add to flour mixture, and stir until thoroughly blended. 2. Put a scant 1/4 cup dough into each muffin cup. (Do not use muffin papers.) Bake until risen and firm on top, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat, and allow to cool. Then remove from pan, and cool completely. Place 6 shortcakes in an airtight freezer bag, and freeze for another use. 3. To prepare filling for 6 shortcakes, whip heavy cream with 2 teaspoons confectioners' sugar until thick but still soft. Add 1/2 cup raspberries to cream, mashing them roughly with a fork. 4. Split each shortcake in half horizontally, and place a dollop of raspberry cream onto bottom half. Add a portion of whole raspberries, and put the top back on at an angle. Sprinkle a dusting of the remaining 1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar over shortcakes, and serve.Yield: 12 shortcakes, and filling for 6.

5246	 1988	a	Tomorrow is the busiest day so far this year for Kentucky Derby prep races, with 44 3-year-olds entered for four races in Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky and New Jersey. All but 8 of those 44 horses have been nominated for the Derby on May 7, and about half of them are being seriously considered for the race.The biggest name in tomorrow's entries is Brian's Time, the Florida Derby winner, who heads a field of 11 in the $500,000 Jim Beam Stakes at Turfway Park. The Roberto colt's main competition at a mile and an eighth should come from Dynaformer, Stalwars and Kingpost. The others in the race, all Derby nominees, are Delightful Doctor, Cannon Dancer, Drouilly's Boy, Buck Forbes, Glory Afar, Jim's Orbit and Longview Ashley.The Rebel Handicap at Oaklawn, the major prep for that track's Arkansas Derby April 23, drew a field of 10 Derby nominees headed by Notebook, who was third in the Florida Derby; Smackover Creek, undefeated in two starts, and Proper Reality, whom Jerry Bailey chose over Brian's Time as a Derby mount. Word Pirate, Morgan's Levee, Din's Dancer, Sea Trek, Contempt, Gallantmister and Hedevar the Bold complete the field for the mile race.The $250,000 Tropical Park Derby at Calder, usually run in January but pushed to April this season amid Florida's chaotic racing politics, drew a weak field despite its fat purse. The leading 3-year-olds who wintered in Florida have been sent north rather than raced over Calder's unusual synthetic track surface. Digress, the trainer Woody Stephens's third-stringer, is the likely favorite against Zie World, Primal, Frosty the Snowman, Above Normal and six others at a mile and an eighth.
1682	 2009	a	He is the first chief executive in decades to lead a major car company into bankruptcy, but Robert L. Nardelli hardly considers himself a failure.Instead, Mr. Nardelli was holding his head high Thursday for helping keep Chrysler in business — bankruptcy or not, The New York Times’s Bill Vlasic reported. “It’s not the fate I would have chosen, but it has allowed us to save the company,” Mr. Nardelli told The Times in an interview. “I think the cup is half full, and not half empty.”His efforts were recognized Thursday by President Obama, who singled out Mr. Nardelli in his remarks for his “positive and constructive role” in getting deals with the Italian automaker Fiat, the United Automobile Workers and Chrysler’s largest lenders that will be integral to a successful restructuring in bankruptcy court.Once Chrysler emerges from Chapter 11, Mr. Nardelli, 60, will leave the company as it transitions to new management selected by a reconstituted board.It was his decision to leave at that point, he said. “I got us here,” he told The Times. “And I feel good about getting us here.”Still, Chrysler’s trip into bankruptcy was hardly the comeback that Mr. Nardelli envisioned when he was hired by Cerberus Capital Management to run the automaker in August 2007.Mr. Nardelli came to Detroit with a reputation as an autocratic executive who had clashed with shareholders and directors at his previous company, Home Depot.He methodically tried to change that perception at Chrysler, where his long days of work and disciplined approach to business decisions won over many skeptical employees and industry experts.A year ago, the privately held Chrysler was flush with cash and leaner than at any time in its history after rounds of job reductions, plant closings and production cuts.Mr. Nardelli told The Times that he believed that Chrysler was poised for a renaissance — until the slumping United States economy dragged new-car sales into the ditch.By last fall, Chrysler was spending billions of dollars in cash reserves and running dangerously close to insolvency. Only a $4 billion federal loan kept the company from shutting its doors months ago.When he joined his fellow chief executives from General Motors and the Ford Motor Company last November to seek government aid for the industry, Mr. Nardelli was set against taking Chrysler into bankruptcy.Even during marathon negotiations in recent days with Chrysler’s unions and banks, he held out hope that bankruptcy could be avoided.“I’m disappointed that we couldn’t get all of the lenders to agree,” he told The Times. “Filing for Chapter 11 was obviously not my preference.”He says he sees a bright future for Chrysler in its alliance with Fiat, which can provide small cars and fuel-efficient engine technology that Chrysler sorely lacks.Once out of bankruptcy, Chrysler will have a new board of nine members — the government will select six and Fiat will choose three.That board will select a chief executive for Chrysler. While Mr. Nardelli said he was never told he could not compete for the job, he felt it was “the right time to transition” to a new chief executive, possibly Fiat’s leader, Sergio Marchionne.“I tend to be proactive,” Mr. Nardelli told The Times. “I felt, let’s get past this issue and get it off the table and behind us.”Thomas LaSorda, a vice chairman who was Mr. Nardelli’s immediate predecessor as chief executive, will also be leaving Chrysler. Mr. LaSorda, 54, said Thursday that he planned to retire, but had not set a date. During a conference call with reporters, another vice chairman, James Press, did not make his plans known.In his relatively short time at the top of Chrysler, Mr. Nardelli did fulfill much of the agenda laid out for him by Cerberus. He streamlined the company and significantly lowered its costs, although tens of thousands of jobs were eliminated in the process.He said he would go back to Cerberus as an adviser, and then evaluate other opportunities.Yet wherever he ends up, Mr. Nardelli’s business career will be defined, in part, by Chrysler’s trip into bankruptcy.It has been an emotionally charged experience, particularly Thursday morning when he flew back to Detroit from Washington to be at Chrysler headquarters in time to watch Mr. Obama’s speech.“I wanted to be here with our people to provide some confidence and assurances about the future,” he told The Times.Go to Article from The New York Times »

3081	 2001	a	To the Editor:Re ''A Global Warning to Mr. Bush'' (editorial, Feb. 26):Not only does President Bush not seem to be interested or even aware of the real possibility of international calamities arising from global warming, he also seems inclined to foreclose on learning more about this phenomenon by cutting back on scientific research.In the midst of talk about trillions of dollars of surpluses, a minuscule increase -- in effect a decrease -- in financing for the National Science Foundation, one of the major sources of research on global climate change, is tantamount to hiding one's head in the sand.Stifling research on global warming will not make the phenomenon go away; it will just enable us to prolong our ignorance about it.PIERRE E.

3008	 2002	a	THEY may be wearing pinstriped uniforms, but five of the nine Yankees in tonight's batting order still have to prove they're Yankees.And you can prove you're a Yankee only by winning the World Series.Anything less, as George Steinbrenner would be the first to tell you, means you've failed to do what has been done by so many proven Yankees, who Joe Torre called ''my guys'' -- earn four World Series rings in five years and come within the ninth inning of another ring a year ago.Many of Torre's guys are still here: Derek Jeter at shortstop, Bernie Williams in center field, Jorge Posada catching, and several pitchers, notably Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte, David Wells, Orlando Hernández and Mariano Rivera. And even without a World Series ring, second baseman Alfonso Soriano has shown he's a Yankee.But the Yankees' success this month figures to turn on those new guys.Of the five new postseason Yankees in tonight's opener of the American League division series against the Anaheim Angels, first baseman Jason Giambi and third baseman Robin Ventura don't need to be introduced.

6050	 1977	a	Governor Carey said yesterday that rents in rent‐controlled or stabilized apartments should be related to the tenants' ability to pay “so that those who need rent control will have it, and those who don't need it and can afford higher rents will pay them.”The proposal could mean higher costs for thousands of tenants in New York City and other parts of the state.He announced that he was forming a “task force” to develop a “needs‐based. rent‐control system” as part of efforts to change the present rent laws. Any such system would have to be approved by the Legislature before it could be adopted.The Governor's statements, made during and after a meeting of corporate executives and members of the Regional Plan Association, immediately drew fire from a major tenants' group, but were applauded in varying degrees by real‐estate spokesmen.

2814	 2003	a	The majority of the 51 seats of the New York City Council were filled with fresh faces two years ago, thanks to a new term-limits law. This November the usual four-year term is shortened by half to allow for a post-census redistricting and all the seats are up for grabs again. But even abbreviated incumbency has its benefits. Only a few members of the Democrat-dominated Council face serious challenges in the Sept. 9 primary. These are The Times's endorsements for some of the most heavily contested races in Manhattan:Eighth District (East Harlem, the Mott Haven section of the Bronx and part of the Upper West Side): The incumbent, Philip Reed, is facing a vigorous challenge from Melissa Mark-Viverito, a member of Community Board 11 in Spanish Harlem and an activist who understands issues most important to its residents. She is Puerto Rican born, an advantage in a district with a majority-Latino population.Mr. Reed is African-American, but his Latino constituents have been among those benefiting from his Council tenure since 1998. While his most-noticed action this term was fathering the ban on cellphone use in theaters, Mr. Reed has a much fuller résumé. On workers' rights, women's rights, tenant protections and services for the elderly, his record is exemplary. In Spanish Harlem the epidemic of asthma among children is being addressed -- and is in decline -- due in part to the attention Mr. Reed won for the problem. While his Spanish admittedly is in a learning stage, Mr. Reed is fluent in the language of an effective councilman. We endorse Mr. Reed for another term on the City Council.10th District (Washington Heights, Inwood): Miguel Martinez, the first-term incumbent, is a likable, low-key politician. But a district with desperate problems like a lack of affordable housing and severely overcrowded classrooms would benefit from an infusion of independent ideas and energy. Ydanis Rodriguez, a teacher and grass-roots organizer who has worked with immigrant children and created a local college preparatory program, has demonstrated a special kind of vitality in pressing for better services for the community. Recently, when the subway stop at 191st Street was closed for repairs through the end of the year, Mr. Rodriguez led a successful effort to get shuttle service for residents. We endorse Ydanis Rodriguez.
3316	 2000	a	The trial is expected to last two days.Mr. Bove was a little-known farmer and union official until last August, when he and the nine other men took a tractor, pick axes and power saws to the local McDonald's. Mr. Bove said at the time that he was incensed by what he saw as the unfairness of the United States to tax French delicacies like Roquefort cheese and pate de foie gras in retaliation for Europe's decision not to import hormone-treated American beef.''That tax decision was outrageous,'' said Arianne Gurreau, a schoolteacher who was camping with her boyfriend. ''I think the judge needs to see that there are all these people who think what he did was correct. We are fighting for values here, for the right to care about what we eat.''Many came with their own fights inspired by Mr. Bove. ''What prompted us to come is the problem of water,'' said Giselle Joffre, a retired government worker. ''In our town it is terribly expensive because we are working with a big company. It is the same with all these multinationals doing what they want.''This was clearly not what many Millau residents had braced for. Most had seen pictures of protesters, including Mr. Bove, at the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle and feared that this demonstration would be just as disruptive.''People were so scared,'' said Christianne Chazal-Martin, the owner of a gift shop near the courthouse who decided to stay open. ''First one got talking and then another, and they went on and on about how bad it was going to be.''Mr. Bove's attack on the McDonald's here last August was only one of a number of assaults on the fast food chain, which is often a target of anti-American protesters. But Mr. Bove became instantly famous when he was thrown in jail for it, and then refused to pay bail for three weeks in protest. Eventually, he did pay the bail with money supplied by a group of supporters, many of them American.Mr. Bove faces charges that could result in a fine of as much as $70,000 and up to five years in jail. But it is considered unlikely that he or any of his co-defendants will serve any jail time for the vandalism, which resulted in $110,000 worth of damage.

4413	 1993	a	By rejecting insistent Bosnian demands today that the United Nations either send soldiers to defend Sarajevo or let the Muslims there buy arms freely to do the job themselves, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has upped the stakes for his organization in its efforts to resolve the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.Throughout a long and difficult day of constant heckling by Sarajevo's residents, the Secretary General insisted over and over again that the only way forward was through negotiation and dialogue, not guns and fighting, and that the omens were good."I believe 1993 will be the year of peace for Bosnia," he said repeatedly. Power Seems to Be SlippingA success would clearly raise his own prestige hugely, along with that of the United Nations. But it is equally clear that another failure would deliver a serious blow to the organization's reputation as a peacemaker at a time when, after a string of early post-cold-war successes, its powers seem to be slipping in several parts of the world.
1433	 2011	a	Timothy Egan on American politics and life, as seen from the West.PHOENIX — When it became clear in the early fall of 2008 that Barack Obama, son of a Kansan and a Kenyan, would be the 44th President of the United States, many citizens rushed to their gun shops, stocked up on ammo and camo, and tried to fortify their nests with all manner of lethal weapons.Though he had said nothing about gun control in the campaign, Obama, to a certain kind of person, appeared to be a grave threat to the Second Amendment. He was urban — Chicago, not the kind of place where a man could shoot a coyote with a laser-sighted Ruger while on his daily jog, as Gov. Rick Perry claims to have done. He was professorial, with scholastic braising at that home of confiscatory consensus, Harvard. And he’d made that statement about rural people clinging to guns and religion.Into the early months of the Obama presidency gun sales went though the roof. A nation of at least 200 million firearms reached for ever more, in a hurry and a frenzy.And then, nothing. No legislation. No speeches about the ubiquity of guns in the most violent of Western democracies. Obama actually increased gun rights, signing a bill with a rider that allows people to pack loaded and concealed heat in national parks. Even after the slaughter in Tucson in January of 2011, when six people were killed and 13 wounded, including Representative Gabrielle Giffords, in a madman’s spree, Obama did nothing to keep guns out of the hands of those at the margins of sanity.At last, though, some evidence seemed to emerge of his real intent: the story of a federal agency, Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, allowing high-powered guns purchased in this state to flow to Mexican drug cartels — a woefully misguided effort to catch bigger fish.To the gun wackos, it was all a grand scheme, hatched at the very top, to move the masses against weapons. That is, guns like AK-47 rifles, sold with some restrictions by dealers here. If the government could prove, through an operation called Fast and Furious, that loose American gun laws were responsible in part for the firepower of Mexican drug gangsters, well, then surely they would move next to restrict the arming of private citizens in the U.S. of A. That was the logic, and the battle cry.Fast and Furious was plotted at the top, proclaimed Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, “so they can stick more gun legislation on honest American gun owners.”Isaac Brekken for The New York TimesThe gun lobby, whose ownership of Congress rivals only that of Wall Street, started a television campaign to oust Attorney General Eric Holder, who said he never authorized the operation.Congressional Republicans, eager to do the N.R.A.’s bidding, launched investigations. Subpoenas were issued. Fox News fanned the flames, without, of course, breaking any news. “Fast and Furious Just Might Be President Obama’s Watergate,” was one headline at Forbes.com.Well, surprise, surprise, surprise, in the words of Gomer Pyle, simpleton and role model no doubt for this Congress. What the documents and testimony showed was that Fast and Furious originated with field agents here in Phoenix — not in the White House — and the tactic was first used under President George W. Bush. His attorney general, Michael Mukasey, was told in a 2007 briefing paper of gun border operations that were precursors to Fast and Furious, and of the need to expand them.Oh. So Bush wanted to take everyone’s guns. Case closed, yes?The plain and simple truth is that Democrats learned from the last gun law episode, when President Clinton led Congress to ban certain kinds of assault weapons in 1994, not to touch this issue. And ever since then, after many Western and rural Democrats were voted out, they have been silent. Your typical Democrat from the West, now, is as likely to show off his gun collection as any preening Republican.In American politics, some issues fade away naturally, while others recirculate. We are a violent nation. More people die from firearms (often their own guns, in suicides, domestic fights and accidents) in America than in almost any other civilized country. About 1 million people have been killed by guns in the United States since 1968.But at the same time, violent crime is down considerably in most parts of the country — as in, levels not seen since Beaver Cleaver’s time. You can argue that the crime decline is because of all the guns in our midst (protection). Or you can argue that we still kill our own at a much higher rate than most countries because of those same guns.But there’s no serious case that President Obama is trying to take people’s guns. Guess what grade the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence gave Obama after one year in office? He got an “F” for his gun stance, or lack of same. This after the N.R.A. predicted that he would be the most anti-gun president in history.Of course, sensible laws might have kept people like Jared Lee Loughner, the clearly deranged accused shooter in the Tucson massacre, from owning — and legally concealing — his Glock 19 semiautomatic, with its multiple-round magazine. But Obama would not use his executive power to make even that case.Left with nothing to fear but imaginary fear itself, the gun nuts are in a terrible rut. They need scary opposition in order to flourish. They need someone to hate. They need conspiracies. And, as always, they need donations.So, in their world, Obama’s silence, his reticence, his passivity is proof of a grand scheme.“It’s all part of a massive conspiracy to deceive voters and hide his true intention to destroy the Second Amendment,” LaPierre told a major conservative gathering this fall.Get it: he’s a stealth threat! By design.It’s much harder to accept the nuance of truth, because that would imperil the power of the gun lobby. And it’s difficult for many to accept the idea that the drift of civilizations in general is toward less violence.“Believe it or not — and I know most people do not — violence has declined over long periods of time, and today we may be living in the most peaceable era in our species’ existence,” wrote Steven Pinker in his provocative new book, “The Better Angels of Our Nature.”Would you think the gun lobby could call a truce? Not a chance.Note: In an earlier version of this article, the caption incorrectly referred to “hand guns.” Also, “multiple-clip magazine,” in the text, should have read “multiple-round magazine.” Both have been corrected.
3385	 2000	a	In two weeks, New York City will submit its bid for the 2012 Summer Games. Last night, the city strutted some of its stuff by gathering more than 100 Olympic athletes from the New York area who competed from 1920 to 2000.It may not curry much favor with the United States Olympic Committee. But the parade of Olympians who collectively won a total of 180 medals, including 83 gold in 35 different sports, celebrated New York's rich Olympic history.Among the all-star cast at the New York Athletic Club was 92-year-old John Slade, a member of the 1948 field hockey team, who says he will always remember the cheers of the 120,000 fans at Wembley Stadium in London during the opening ceremony; Dick Button, who won gold medals in figure skating in 1948 and 1952; Doug Heir, the four-time Paralympian and 2000 U.S. Paralympic team captain in track and field; and Diane Dixon, who won a gold medal in track in 1984 and a silver in 1988.Daniel Doctoroff, founder and president of NYC2012, the nonprofit organization authorized by the city to lead its efforts to host the 2012 Olympics, said the reunion was a way of honoring the ''circle of Olympians'' living in the New York area, including 63 in New Jersey, 60 in Pennsylvania, 28 in Connecticut.

5632	 1986	a	The House of Representatives will bid a fond, sentimental and bipartisan farewell tonight to Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., who is retiring when Congress adjourns, probably in the next few days.Since 1980 the senior elected Democrat, Mr. O'Neill has spent virtually all his adult life in politics.He was elected to the Massachusetts legislature in 1936 when he was 23 years old and served until 1952, the last four years as Speaker of the House. In 1952 he was elected to the House of Representative, where he has served 34 years, the last 16 as a member of the Democratic leadership and the last 10 as Speaker.When the House concludes its regular business this evening, leaders of both parties will salute the Speaker with floor tributes. It is not a surprise party. A screen will be installed behind the rostrum for a special O'Neill film, which features his cameo appearance in the television show ''Cheers'' in a Boston bar. Then all hands will adjourn to the Capitol Rotunda for a reception honoring Mr. O'Neill and his family.

1845	 2008	a	Updated, 11:06 a.m. | Even as supporters of congestion pricing prepared to gather at City Hall at 11 a.m. today to cheer the City Council’s vote approving the plan and to urge the State Legislature to approve the $8-a-day traffic fees, opponents of congestion pricing have mobilized as well — at least in their talking points.City Room received an intriguing e-mail message this morning from Carolyn Daly and Corey B. Bearak of Keep NYC Congestion Tax Free, a group that opposes congestion pricing.“Despite all of the efforts of the city administration and City Council, the congestion pricing scheme died at midnight last night,” they wrote. “Last year, the State Senate, State Assembly and governor passed into law legislation which set out the creation of the commission to study traffic congestion. It also set the deadline for final action in a clear and unambiguous manner. That legal deadline was March 31, 2008. The language is very clearly and explicit. And it is equally clear that the State Legislature did not approve anything regarding congestion pricing by the stated deadline. The governor did not sign any measure into law by the stated deadline.”Although a federal memorandum of understanding with the city sets the deadline at April 7 — rather than March 31 — that deadline is “legally only an agreement to agree and does not supersede a law,” Mr. Bearak and Ms. Daly wrote.Unsurprisingly, supporters of congestion pricing immediately dismissed the argument as specious. After all, if the Legislature set the March 31 deadline in the first place, the Legislature can extend such deadline.“This is nonsense,” Stu Loeser, the press secretary for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, wrote in an e-mail message in response to questions from The Times. “As we are reminded again and again, a current Legislature cannot bind the hands of a future one. The State Legislature has the same powers to pass congestion pricing today as they did yesterday.”Gene Russianoff, a staff lawyer at the Straphangers Campaign of the New York Public Interest Research Group, also scoffed at the notion. “April 7 is the real deadline — 90 days since the start of the legislative session, which was the requirement,” he said in a phone interview. “The March 31 deadline, which is part of the law that created the commission, on which I sat, is not a real deadline. The Legislature could just change it. If the Legislature decides to do congestion pricing, the March 31 deadline will not be an obstacle — or an excuse.”

1126	 2012	a	PhotoEarly in “Being Flynn,” the new movie directed by Paul Weitz, Jonathan Flynn slides behind the wheel of a yellow cab as his voice, on the soundtrack, gives vent to a barrage of misanthropy. It is hard for a movie lover not to detect a wink in this otherwise perfectly ordinary scene, since Jonathan is played by Robert De Niro, the most famous taxi driver in movies. “Being Flynn” is a much milder movie than “Taxi Driver,” pursuing intimate themes rather than big ideas, but Jonathan Flynn and Travis Bickle are linked by the discrepancy between self-image and reality and also by Mr. De Niro’s gift for portraying alienated men at odds with themselves.He has not done much of that lately. Moviegoers too young for “Taxi Driver” or “Raging Bull” know him as the comically menacing patriarch of the “Meet the Parents” movies, the last of which was directed by Mr. Weitz. And while his performance as Jonathan Flynn strays now and then into histrionics (not without reason), it also provides a reminder of what a resourceful, unpredictable and subtle actor Mr. De Niro can be.Jonathan runs on vodka, orange juice, bile and delusions of grandeur. He is a writer, and in his own estimation one of only three in American letters worth bothering with, the other two being Mark Twain and J. D. Salinger. His own shaggy, rambling manner, and his shabby circumstances, suggest Charles Bukowski, but with more blarney and less compassion. “We are put on this earth to help other people” is his motto, but in practice it seems to mean that everyone else on earth should either see to his needs or leave him alone.Jonathan is not the only Flynn, or the only writer, in “Being Flynn.” The movie is equally the story of his son, Nick, who grew up with his mother (Julianne Moore) and the legend of his absent dad. Jonathan served time in federal prison for passing bad checks, writing letters to Nick that fed the boy’s literary ambition but even after release never showing up in person. In his 20s Nick, played by Paul Dano, starts working at a homeless shelter where Jonathan, after losing his apartment and his job, happens to take up residence. The two of them establish a difficult, painful and ambiguous connection. The real Nick Flynn wrote about this in a memoir with a title too pungent and profane for me to repeat here. Mr. Weitz, whose adaptation has been approved by Mr. Flynn, has softened and streamlined the story, but his desire to retain some of the book’s candor and poetry is evident. Sometimes awkwardly and sometimes gracefully, “Being Flynn” charts a middle course between the rough honesty of its source and the sentimental triteness of the much worse movie it could have been.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThe melodrama of parent-child reconciliation, of redemption and recovery and hard lessons tenderly learned is a staple of movies and television, and the magnetic pull of that therapeutic genre is hard to resist. It is to Mr. Weitz’s credit that he tries. He does not force Jonathan and Nick into teary embraces or ringing speeches but rather lets Mr. Dano and Mr. De Niro find their own rhythms, which don’t always harmonize. Mr. Dano is a quiet, inscrutable presence, but has an odd charisma, a blend of sensitivity and bottled-up rage, that makes him an intriguing foil for Mr. De Niro, as he was for Daniel Day-Lewis in “There Will be Blood.”Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Jonathan certainly knows how to call attention to himself. Nick is more diffident and watchful, and it is easier to sympathize with someone tormented by the death of his mother and the toxic legacy of his father’s neglect. He has his own self-destructive patterns of behavior, but these are examined more superficially than his father’s, which is too bad.

5495	 1987	a	''Now, it's all about a legacy for this team and for Kareem,'' Riley said. ''That's the only thing left for them at this point. Once he leaves there'll be a new, fresh challenge. Another ring? That's not enough. When I asked them who they thought the greatest team ever was, the only team out of their lips was Boston. Every time anyone looks at Russell, all they think of is the respect he achieves through his association with that team. These guys have a chance to attain that same kind of respect.''In fact, the Lakers are well stocked and well prepared to defend their title, perhaps more so than any champion in the last 18 seasons. But talent and preparation, as many of their predecessors have proved, do not assure any team of repeating. Other factors conspire to undermine the champion's resolve. Jealousy? If this was to have afflicted the Lakers, it would have done so last season when Riley passed the torch of leadership from Abdul-Jabbar to Johnson. With that torch came a season in which Johnson took more shots and scored more points than he had in any of his seven previous seasons, and won the most valuable player award for the first time. Rather than resist what was a drastic change, the Lakers, including Abdul-Jabbar, seemed inspired by it.Byron Scott, James Worthy, Michael Cooper and even Abdul-Jabbar all either had what Riley calls ''career seasons'' or surpassed their achievements of the previous season.''I think everybody has taken their game to a higher level,'' said Scott, the Lakers' other guard. ''We all still take our cues from Magic. It's worked so far.''This season, Johnson and his lucrative smile dominate the cover of the team's media guide, clutching the golden championship trophy behind smaller images of Abdul-Jabbar, Cooper, Worthy and Riley. So far, copies of the book have not been passed around the locker room. Greed? It often happens that teams are weakened by the desire of players to cash in on their championship seasons, or the feeling by management that it must make personnel changes in order to avoid stagnation. Either the team loses one or more players through free agency or it executes a trade, or players press for renegotiation of their contracts, all of which tinker with the championship team's already-delicate balance. For example, in the year following the Seattle Supersonics' championship season in 1979, tensions between starting guards, Dennis Johnson and Gus Williams - primarily over money - and their coach, Lenny Wilkens, began a long decline for that team.On Friday evening at the Forum, perhaps all but one of the 12 players who were members of the championship team will be present to receive their rings. Adrian Branch, a bit player, is on the verge of losing his place on the roster to Milt Wagner, the former Louisville guard, or Jeff Lamp, formerly of Virginia.And the only player who has crowed for a raise is Johnson, who is unhappy with his $1 million salary (even with $1.5 million in deferred money starting in 1994), which is about $2.5 million less than what Abdul-Jabbar earns. Jerry Buss, the team owner, will probably settle the issue before it becomes a problem. Injuries? This is the one area over which no one has control, and it is already beginning to have an effect. Johnson played in only three games during the exhibition season because of tendinitis in his left ankle, a condition that will require him to wear a specially constructed shoe and perhaps undergo regular treatment. And last week, Worthy suffered a sprained ankle in an exhibition game against the Nets. It was not diagnosed as being severe, although Worthy has missed two games.

3458	 1999	a	The State Department report said Mr. bin Laden, who has recently operated from bases in Afghanistan and is being sought in the United States on murder charges, had ''global reach'' and offered ''logistical help to extremists not directly affiliated with his organization.''Department officials insisted that the decision not to designate Iran as the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism was not meant as a gesture of good will toward Iran.Instead, they said, it reflected a reduction in terrorist attacks that could clearly be attributed to organizations supported by Iran. The report found that Iran apparently killed fewer Iranian dissidents abroad last year than in 1997.''There is a slight improvement in their record, and we wanted to reflect that in our conclusions,'' said a department official who insisted on anonymity. ''We just didn't feel the need to single them out in the way we have in the past. We obviously want to encourage better behavior.''Others in the Administration said the report had been worded in a fashion that they hoped would make clear to Iran the willingness of Washington to improve ties.''It would obviously be tough for us to go out there and brand Iran as the world's premier terrorist state while at the same time talking about our hope for better relations,'' said an American official who insisted on anonymity. ''If the Iranians read this as a signal for better ties, fine.''The report found that Iran ''continued to be involved in the planning and execution of terrorist acts'' and that it might have been responsible for the murders of five leading Iranian writers and political figures last year. The department also said Iran continued support a variety of terrorist groups in the Middle East, including Hamas, Hizballah and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.

5371	 1987	a	Q.You recently recommended storing a power lawn mower indoors in winter. However, I prefer not to store anything indoors that contains gasoline. I don't have a garage, but I am storing the mower in an unheated utility shed. Will extreme cold cause problems when I try to start the mower in spring? A.Your concern does not apply. One of the first things recommended when storing a power mower is to drain all gasoline from the tank, carburetor and fuel lines. However, storing the mower inside a cold shed will do it no harm and should not affect the engine in any way. Q.We recently moved into a house with an unheated dirt basement. We found firewood stored there, covered with mold. A strong odor of mold pervades the house. We are removing the wood. What else can we do to get rid of the moldy odor? A.First, cover the dirt floor with heavy sheet plastic or heavy tar paper. Overlap strips at least 6 inches and lap them up onto the walls 8 to 10 inches on all sides. Hold the plastic in place with bricks or cement blocks. Be sure the basement area is well ventilated with louvered openings on opposite sides for cross ventilation. The openings should be large enough to provide at least 1 square foot of unobstructed area for every 1,500 square feet of floor area in the basement (screens and louvers over the vents cut the actual size of the opening by half). Q.My family room has a concrete slab floor that is very cold in the winter. It is about a foot lower than the first floor, so I may add a ''false'' insulated floor on top of the slab. I plan to put down 2-by-4's with 5/8-inch plywood on top, filling the spaces between the 2-by-4's with fiberglass insulation. The insulation will have a foil vapor barrier on one side. Where should the vapor barrier go - on the bottom, against the concrete, or on the top, directly under the plywood? A.Always put the vapor barrier on the warmer side of the insulation - the side facing the heated area in the winter. Your vapor barrier should be on top of the insulation, directly under the plywood. Q.Our concrete basement walls are covered with a white crystalline substance that looks something like a powdery dusting of snow. After we washed a portion of the wall off with bleach and water the substance seemed to ''grow'' back. What can be used to remove this? A.This substance is the result of efflorescence. It is caused by the release of alkaline salts that leach out of the concrete when there is dampness present and when there are excess alkalies in the masonry.You can get rid of the powder by washing with a mild solution of muriatic acid (one part acid to five parts water). This neutralizes the alkalies and washes off the white powder.There is no guarantee that the efflorescence won't come back, unless you can eliminate the dampness. Applying a masonry paint or sealer sometimes helps, but not always.Questions about home repair problems should be addressed to Home Improvement Department, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036. Questions of general interest will be answered in this column; unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.
82	 2019	a	TEL AVIV — “He’s a magician! He’s a magician!”It was nearly 2 a.m. on April 10, and supporters of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had packed a sporting arena in Tel Aviv, were cheering his apparent election victory.Facing a stiff challenge from a former military chief and the prospect of criminal indictment on corruption charges, Mr. Netanyahu, whose unrivaled political instincts had him on track to become Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, had pulled another rabbit out of his hat.Less than two months later, after his failure to assemble a governing coalition forced the country into an unprecedented do-over election, Israeli pundits are asking whether even magic can save him now.With the new election still more than three months away, no one is foolish enough to write him off altogether. But the math and the calendar are unforgiving.

333	 2017	a	Jeter and Bush have lined up Citibank to help them pay for the team, which is owned by Jeffrey Loria, a New York art dealer who has often conducted fire sales of expensive talent. The club is expected to sell for about $1.3 billion, but about $400 million of that amount is debt on the team. Bush, Jeter and their fellow investors would need to raise $800 million to $900 million to cover the rest.Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said recently that the Bush-Jeter group was not the only bidder for the Marlins, who have consistently ranked near the bottom of the major leagues in attendance and payroll. The other major bidder remaining is a group that includes Tagg Romney, the eldest son of Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee for president in 2012. Tagg Romney has worked in marketing at Reebok and with the Los Angeles Dodgers.If it can complete the details of its financial plan to buy the team, the Bush-Jeter group is the favorite to win the bidding because of Jeter’s prestige inside baseball and Bush’s standing in Florida.“The team will be sold,” said a person with knowledge of the process who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. “It’s just a question of when.”If the Marlins are sold for $1.3 billion, it will represent the second-highest price paid for a major league team, after the $2 billion paid for the Dodgers in 2012.

4633	 1992	a	The Spicing of AmericaThe American appetite for spicy food has yet to be sated. Total consumption of spice last year was 821 million pounds, an increase of 3 percent over the year before, according to figures from the American Spice Trade Association. Black pepper, up 18 percent, now accounts for about 10 percent of total spice consumption. Consumption of red peppers like cayenne and chili increased by about 10 percent. While its rise last year was not as striking as black pepper's, total red-pepper consumption amounted to 155 million pounds, nearly 20 percent of the total. Foods From All OverOn Saturday from 11 A.M. to 10:30 P.M., Water Street in lower Manhattan, from Fulton to State streets, will be the scene of a food festival. Restaurants and small vendors from all over New York will sell foods of many of the city's ethnic populations. In addition to Manhattan restaurants like Rosa Mexicano and Tropica, Greek restaurants in Astoria, Queens, Korean restaurants in Flushing, Queens, and the River Cafe in Brooklyn plan to take part.Fish Ban in ItalyA parasitic round worm called the Anisakis nematode infests fish caught and eaten in many countries, including the United States. In Italy, the Ministry of Health has prohibited restaurants and other food-service outlets from serving raw, marinated-uncooked and cold-smoked fish. The ministry called sardines, anchovies, mackerel, red mullet and cod especially risky.Only if the fish has been treated to kill the parasites, by freezing at less than 0 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 24 hours, or by heating to 140 degrees for 10 minutes, is it considered safe. The ministry said the parasites pose a health risk only if they are alive. Fish Market Branches Out

1190	 2012	a	Seventeen was once the magazine girls picked up before they turned 13 and cast aside well before they headed to senior prom.But Seventeen’s popularity has been growing with college students, and now the magazine is introducing along with its August issue a 40-page supplement called Seventeen College Style. Due out Tuesday, the issue includes articles on campus fashions, creative ways to apply eye makeup for rush week events and affordable ways to decorate a dorm room and make it the “hangout, study haven, makeout spot of your dreams,” according to the magazine.In developing material, Seventeen worked with several Web sites, including hercampus.com, aimed at women in college, and relied on a survey of 1,000 female college students. It also tried to tailor its articles to women on a variety of campuses.“We are the magazine that helps them go to college,” said Ann Shoket, Seventeen’s editor in chief. “We designed the stories so that it was drilled down to what kind of college you are going to.”Seventeen views the supplement as a safe investment, citing data from the media research firm GfK MRI showing that the number of 18- to 24-year-old women reading the magazine jumped by 17 percent in the last five years.Ms. Shoket credits the growth partly to the events it has been holding on college campuses, where copies of the magazine and samples from advertisers are distributed to students. For the last five years, Seventeen has also run a “Freshman 15” program in which 15 women write blogs about their first year.Danai Kadzere, a 19-year-old Harvard student entering her junior year, who appears in the latest issue, said that after taking a break from reading Seventeen for a couple of years, she returned to it because she wanted to see clothes she could actually buy.“Vogue, I cannot afford a single thing in there. But in Seventeen I can afford most of all of it,” said Ms. Kadzere. “In college, your parents aren’t paying for your clothes anymore. Even with a summer job, it still doesn’t come up to being able to afford a $100 T-shirt.”

2856	 2003	a	But after he heard the testimony of SUNY's chancellor, Robert King, at the committee hearing in New York City on Tuesday, Mr. Canestrari said, he doubted that SUNY would deliver such material before the governor issued his next executive budget, for the 2004-05 fiscal year.''These are public dollars, and legislators have a right to know how they will be spent,'' Mr. Canestrari said, explaining why he and other legislators wanted more information. ''I don't know why SUNY won't provide it. They have done it before. It is not as if we are reinventing the wheel.''David Henahan, a SUNY spokesman, said that five years ago, SUNY assessed each campus's critical maintenance needs before assembling a five-year capital request. This time, he said, the university had planned to allocate money based on the size in square feet ''to provide the campuses with maximum flexibility.''If SUNY was loath to be more specific, CUNY faculty members, students and administrators turned out in force at the Assembly hearing last week to make the case for how capital ought to be spent at their university.Some of the most devastating testimony came from the chairwoman of the biology department at the City College of New York, Jane Gallagher, who said the college's Marshak science building had deteriorated to the point of crisis. She said that people fainted from leaking fumes in the building and had to be carried out on stretchers, and that black dust showered on people from air ducts.''We have been inundated in water from broken pipes to the point where we have had waterfalls going down the fire stairs from the 13th floor to the basement,'' Ms. Gallagher said. ''Every time it rains outside, water seeps from the external balconies into the labs on the corners of the building. Some of the labs have growths of species of fungi known to be harmful to human health. We have been unsuccessful in eradicating these fungi.''Barbara Bowen, president of CUNY's faculty and staff union, the Professional Staff Congress, said many CUNY colleges had poor conditions, including falling concrete, elevators that do not reach all floors and crowding that results when 18,000 students are squeezed into space designed for 7,000.
1748	 2009	a	Sara Krulwich/The New York TimesAs part of its 2010-11 season dedicated to the work of the playwright Tony Kushner, the Signature Theater Company will mount the first New York revival of his “Angels in America” since the Pulitzer Prize- and Tony Award-winning work closed on Broadway in 1994, the troupe’s artistic director said this afternoon.The production, to be directed by Michael Greif (“Next to Normal,” “Rent”), will open at the Signature’s 160-seat theater late in 2010, and is expected to run for about four months, said the artistic director, James Houghton. Both plays that make up “Angels” — “Millennium Approaches” and “Perestroika” — will run in repertory; the theater also plans to have performance days where the plays (each three and a half hours) are presented back to back.Set in 1985 and 1986 against the backdrop of the AIDS epidemic and the Reagan administration, “Angels” interweaves the stories of a gay couple grappling with AIDS; a closeted Mormon lawyer and his drug-addicted wife; and several other, often fantastical characters, from the real-life, right-wing lawyer Roy Cohn to a steel-winged angel who memorably crashes through a ceiling at the end of “Millennium Approaches.”“Millennium Approaches” opened on Broadway in May 1993 and “Perestroika” that November, and were widely praised as landmark works of theater as well as significant meditations on gay life, politics, and religion in America. Both parts of “Angels” won Tony Awards in 1993 and ’94 for best play, and “Millennium Approaches” won the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1993.Mr. Houghton said that he and Mr. Kushner agreed very quickly that the timing was ripe to include an “Angels” revival in a season devoted to Kushner plays (Signature features work by a single playwright over a full season).“Among other things the play is a rumination on how we confront change, the challenge of change, and our choices around the themes of changes — both the courageous choices we make and the less so,” Mr. Houghton said. “It’s an incredibly relevant piece of writing for the America that we’re living in today.”No casting decisions have been made yet, and Mr. Houghton said that the creative team was in the early stages of conceptualizing an epic work like “Angels” for Signature’s intimate Off Broadway space on 42nd Street.“It’s a huge challenge to figure out how to make these terrifically theatrical elements come to life within certain space limitations, but the great thing about theater is that limitations often yield truly creative and original results,” Mr. Houghton said.Asked if the angel would still crash onto the stage at the end of “Millennium Approaches” — a moment that prompts a character to remark, “Very Steven Spielberg” — Mr. Houghton said, “We don’t know yet how we’re solving that particular challenge.”Mr. Kushner said in a statement that Signature was “the perfect space” for both the epic and intimate qualities of “Angels.” He is likely to attend rehearsals, Mr. Houghton said, but has no plans to do any new writing on “Angels.”The Kushner season will include two other plays, which Mr. Houghton was not ready to announce yet. He said he and Mr. Kushner were discussing the possibility of him writing a new play — Signature seasons often include a new work by the playwright being showcased — but nothing had been decided.As part of Signature’s Ticket Initiative, sponsored chiefly by Time Warner Inc., all tickets to “Angels” will be $20. The production is also being supported by a $750,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, provided expressly for the “Angels” revival, Mr. Houghton said.

4167	 1995	a	To publicize their prime-time programming for the 1995-96 season, the CBS and NBC television networks are sponsoring large promotional partnerships.CBS has teamed up with Sears, Roebuck & Company for an integrated promotion meant to create awareness of the new CBS fall schedule and attract customers to Sears stores for an annual anniversary sale. The network declined to discuss the budget.The promotion, called "Where It's At," begins in September with print and broadcast advertising; on-line promotions on Prodigy, owned by Sears and I.B.M., and on the World Wide Web of the Internet, and a "CBS Fall Viewing Guide" booklet. A sweepstakes will offer consumers a grand prize to "Be a TV Hotshot" -- the chance to "get an inside look at life as a network executive." CBS previously sponsored promotions with the Kmart Corporation.NBC, a unit of the General Electric Company; Nintendo of America and Blockbuster Video, which is owned by Viacom Inc., have joined for a $5 million promotion touting the NBC fall lineup and Virtual Boy, a new Nintendo 3-D video game that will be available to rent at Blockbuster. The promotion begins on Aug. 14 in 3,000 Blockbuster stores, with a sweepstakes offering prizes like trips to the tapings of NBC shows.

4412	 1993	a	JEAN HARRIS IS ONE, BUT MANY REMAINWhile Governor Cuomo granted clemency to Jean Harris, who has served 12 years for the slaying of her lover, other women incarcerated for killing the men in their lives -- most of them in a single act of violence after years of brutal physical abuse -- remain behind bars. In New York, as across the country, advocates for battered women are urging a re-evaluation of the harsh sentences usually given women who kill or assault the people who have abused them. A1. NEW YORK CITY EMPIRE GRANTED RATE INCREASEThe Cuomo administration granted a large rate increase to Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the state's largest health insurer, presenting 1.4 million New Yorkers -- many of whom cannot get coverage from commercial insurers -- with increases in premiums that will average 25.5 percent. The increases are to take effect immediately, though hope of a state-financed bailout remains.

4629	 1992	a	More than any other initiative taken by Tokyo in the postwar era, the peacekeeping bill has become the symbol of how far Japan is willing to go in fulfilling its pledges to take a greater political role in world affairs, one that would be more commensurate with its economic might.But as the debate unfolded, it became clear that many of Japan's leaders envision a far more active, risky role than do many of its citizens, who see little advantage in dispensing with the postwar prohibition on sending forces abroad. Under most current interpretations of the Constitution, which was written by the American occupying force here after Japan's surrender, the country's Self-Defense Forces are strictly prohibited from venturing beyond Japan's shores or engaging in acts of "collective security."Since the gulf war, when Japan contributed $12 billion but no personnel to the multinational force that liberated Kuwait, debate has raged here over whether the post-cold-war era requires a fundamental change in Japanese policy.Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa declared passage of the bill one of his top priorities, and many political analysts here believe that his tenure may depend on how skillfully he secures its passage without harming his party's chances in a critical election this summer. Many political leaders here also consider passage a prerequisite if Japan hopes to realize its ambitions to become a member of the United Nations Security Council in coming years. Public Is OpposedNonetheless, polls show that the Japanese public is clearly opposed to any plan to send its troops into combat areas, with many questioning whether they can yet trust their Government to keep a rein on the military. As a result, the governing party -- fearful that its efforts to pass some kind of peacekeeping bill could be defeated for a third time -- has been struggling for ways to pass the core elements of the bill, while at the same time at least seeming to be responsive to the public's apprehensions. And it is possible the fragile coalition being built around the bill could still collapse, perhaps leading to the dissolution of both houses of Parliament and the calling of a general election.
5093	 1989	a	Successive NATO commanders have said that at present strengths, Soviet conventional superiority will force them to request authority to use nuclear weapons very early in any conflict. Gen. John Galvin, Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, said that ''we must rely on our short range nuclear forces.'' His predecessor, Gen. Bernard Rogers, calculated that it would be just a matter of days after coming under attack that nuclear weapons would be needed to prevent the collapse of NATO defenses. Complex Control of WarheadsBut even in the unlikely event that the alliance's civilian leaders agreed that tactical nuclear weapons should be used - in the equally unlikely event that such a war broke out - the request and authorization process to use nuclear weapons must go through seven military and political levels before a warhead would be released. Under the best of circumstances this would take about 24 hours. In the chaos of the early days of a war, it is doubtful that the process could be completed in time to keep up with events on the battlefield.Gen. Donn Starry, in testimony on Capitol Hill before he retired from the Army, said, ''The delays that are attendant upon asking for and receiving nuclear weapons release always create a situation in which, if you wait until they get into your territory to ask for the use of nuclear weapons, it is always too late.''The Soviet Union has forsworn first use of nuclear weapons, but its military writings make it clear that NATO's battlefield nuclear arsenal is at the top of its list of targets. There are less than 100 American-controlled nuclear storage sites in Europe and the Soviet commanders know their locations. According to American intelligence officers, the Soviet forces plan to attack them from the air and with special operations forces in the event of war. And Soviet military journals imply that if there are signs that the alliance is preparing to use the weapons, the other side would pre-empt such action with its own nuclear weapons. A Short-Lived AdvantageBut even if NATO forces fire first to halt a Soviet attack, it would provide only a short-lived military advantage if Soviet forces responded by using nuclear missiles from their own formidable inventory of battlefield weapons. This in turn could lead to nuclear escalation, which neither side wants.

Eliezer Associates, Inc. wishes to extend its deepest sympathies to Betty Quadracci, her family and all of the employees of Quad/Graphics, Inc. for the passing of Harry Quadracci, our friend and an industry activist. Our association with Harry Quadracci spans nearly 30 years, both personally and professionally. He was the consummate, innovative businessman, with that special insight into how to make individuals work together to create the largest private printing firm in the world. In addition, he was a tireless philanthropist who supported many worthwhile causes, in Wisconsin and throughout the country. We will miss him dearly, in our everyday working environment and in our hearts.
31	 2019	a	Dear Simon Branson: Today is going to be a good day, and here’s why.Oh wait, wrong show.But a person could be forgiven for momentarily confusing “Superhero,” the new musical about a withdrawn teenager and his anxious mother, with “Dear Evan Hansen,” the hit musical about a withdrawn teenager and his anxious mother.It’s not just that the boys’ names scan so similarly. Or that both shows are about fatherless families: Evan’s the result of divorce; Simon’s the result of an accident. The opening songs (“Anybody Have a Map?” in “Dear Evan Hansen” and “What’s Happening to My Boy?” in “Superhero”) have nearly identical emotional setups, including nearly identical phrases about mothers finding their way back to their sons.More fundamentally, both “Superhero” and “Dear Evan Hansen” show how damaged people try to use stories, whether fictional or outright false, to rebuild themselves after trauma — and how they may create new traumas in the process.
4200	 1995	a	For the first time since the wars of Yugoslavia's destruction began in 1991, the way to an unlovely peace appears to be opening, but several extremely difficult issues remain.The door to negotiation was opened over a fifth summer of war by several crucial developments: a new balance of power, inimical to the Serbs, rooted in the growing strength of the Croatian Army; a new wave of expulsions -- of Serbs from Croatia and Muslims from Serbian-held eastern Bosnia -- that virtually completed the slicing up of the former Yugoslavia into ethnically homogeneous zones; and the political victory, consummated this week after more than a year of maneuvering, of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia over a much weakened Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic.These internal developments were complemented by equally important changes in Western capitals and in the United Nations command in Bosnia that have made a resolution of the war more likely.In Sarajevo, Lieut. Gen. Rupert Smith replaced Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose as commander of the United Nations forces in Bosnia and brought a complete change of style. General Smith pointed relentlessly to the fundamental contradiction of Western policy: The presence of United Nations peacekeepers in territory exposed to any NATO air strikes.

711	 2015	a	PhotoAdministrivial Notepad-in-the-Tuesday-Puzzle Alert! If you solve the crossword using Across Lite, the iOS app or the Windows app, please take the time to read the Notepad in the Tuesday puzzle. I can’t tell you what it says because it would spoil the puzzle, but trust the emus: you’ll have a much better experience if you read it.MONDAY PUZZLE — Well. Here we are, with a hilarious and well-developed puzzle by Loren Muse Smith and Andrea “I Rock Mondays” Michaels. Now I just have to blog this in a way that won’t get me fired. [What? — Ed.] [Nothing. — D.A.]It’s definitely a refreshing theme by our standards, and this makes a pair of New York Times puzzles by Loren Muse Smith. There are three types of bras hinted at by the starts of the theme entries, and the revealer at 58 Across gives the entire puzzle an energetic boost. Interestingly, the last time BOOBY TRAPS was seen in The New York Times crossword was in 1968, and it’s high time it was brought back, so kudos, Ms. Smith, Ms. Michaels and Will Shortz.What I really liked was the smoothness of the solve and you could definitely feel Ms. Michaels’s touch here. I don’t think I hit any speedbumps here at all. My favorite entries were PADDED CELL, PUSH UP DAISIES, MIRACLE WORKER, ODDS MAKER and SPORK.Let’s chat with our constructors:Constructors’ Notes:Loren Muse Smith: A couple of years ago, Andrea emailed me, telling me I should consider trying to construct. We started working on various ideas – man, she’s a bundle of energy and enthusiasm! And patience. It occurred to me that I could take some wordplay I’d been joking around with for years before constructing and translate them into themes. I’ve been maintaining for years that BOOBY TRAPS would be a fun name for a bra store. So then I thought it’d be a cool revealer. My thought on its execution was utterly pedestrian; Andrea is the one who suggested going the disguise-the-bra-type-in-another-phrase idea. We racked our brains coming up with kinds of bras – training, halter, Wonder, support, plunge – until we settled on this group. It’s cheeky, but I hope solvers will be good sports as Will continues to allow the Grey Lady to, well, to bust out of her more traditional confines of propriety and decorum. Andrea Carla Michaels: I was impressed with Loren’s unbridled enthusiasm and hysterical anecdotes on “another” blog and thought she’d make a fantastic constructrix, if given a bit of a nudge. This took 3-/2 years to “develop”! It was quickly accepted 3 years ago, but sat on for who knows why! By the time it was ready to publish, we were told the fill would no longer fly. We had five entries, some starting with the bra type, some ending, so in order to get a cleaner fill, we decided four would be the new five, and we would start all the theme phrases with types of bras … Loren created a nice new grid with CHEST in the middle. But in the end, CLINT gave us the cleanest fill. We are thrilled that it’s finally seeing the light of day … and yes, we would like a medal AND a chest to pin it on!O.K., then. Let’s change the subject:Your thoughts?
348	 2017	a	WASHINGTON — George T. Conway III, the husband of the presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway, has withdrawn himself from consideration to become the head of the Justice Department’s civil division, he said in a statement on Friday, citing family considerations as he became the latest sign of personnel woes at the White House.Mr. Conway had been President Trump’s pick to lead an office staffed by about 1,000 lawyers — with a vast portfolio of cases dealing with issues ranging from national security to the actions of the president — but his nomination had not yet been submitted to the Senate. Mr. Conway’s decision to step aside comes as the White House — hobbled from the start by a sluggish transition that failed to generate a list of fully vetted candidates — is still struggling to fill some of the most important positions in the federal government.James Donovan, whom Mr. Trump nominated last month to be the deputy secretary of the Treasury, dropped out just three days later, citing family considerations. Also last month, Mark E. Green, a Tennessee state senator and Army flight surgeon, became the second person to withdraw as Mr. Trump’s prospective secretary of the Army.The president has also yet to settle on a new F.B.I. director after his abrupt firing last month of James B. Comey. Former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut announced he did not want to be considered for that position, citing his law firm’s role in the legal team being assembled to represent Mr. Trump during investigations into whether his presidential campaign had ties to Russia.

2405	 2005	a	For several years now, Thomas L. Friedman has balanced two major subjects: the Middle East and globalization. The Middle East, with the specter of civilizational clashes and apocalyptic terrorism, has been the bad news. Globalization, promising international prosperity and harmony, has been the good. Yet as Friedman shows in his new book, "The World Is Flat," this good news may not be all that good, at least for those who keep an eye on America's place in the world. Friedman presents a passel of statistics showing that we are falling badly behind in the crucial areas of science and technology.There is probably no one more aware of these trends than Fareed Zakaria, the editor of Newsweek International and author of the best-selling book "The Future of Freedom." In his review of Friedman's book (Page 10), Zakaria cites a passage in which Friedman stands outside an outsourcing company in Bangalore and watches "wave after wave" of young Indian techies passing by, all eager, all prepared to participate in the new global economy. Meanwhile, as Friedman tells us, America ranked third in the world in the number of science degrees awarded to 18-to-24-year-olds three decades ago. Today it ranks 17th.On the back page, Randy Cohen, who writes the Ethicist column for The Times Magazine, makes an unusual appeal to readers: Cohen is putting together, with the help of the graphic artist Nigel Holmes, a literary map of Manhattan for the Book Review -- not of authors' homes and haunts, but those of their fictional characters: from the Plaza, where not only Eloise but Woody Allen's Emma Bovary lives (and Jay Gatsby visits), to St. George's Church in Stuyvesant Square, where Mary McCarthy's novel "The Group" begins. We're counting on readers to send in their own favorite New York literary citations. See the box on Page 31 for more information.

2919	 2002	a	To the Editor:Citing the First Amendment, Stephen Gillers opposes a Minnesota rule that bars judicial candidates from announcing their views on issues likely to come before them if elected (''Let Judicial Candidates Speak,'' Op-Ed, March 28). But there are values of equal constitutional importance on the other side of this controversy: the right to fair and impartial courts.Already that right is jeopardized by the increasing role of money in judicial elections. The public wants judges who dispense impartial justice, but three-quarters of voters now believe that campaign contributions are influencing judicial decisions.Without safeguards like the one in Minnesota, judicial candidates will feel more pressure to speak to the special interests that pay for campaigns.DEBORAH GOLDBERGNew York, March 28, 2002The writer is a lawyer at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.

4902	 1990	a	A woman with a passion for clipping coupons and proof-of-purchase seals has been convicted of dealing in counterfeit coupons in a $2 million scheme.A Federal jury deliberated five days before reaching its verdict Tuesday against the 34-year-old defendant, Connie Arvidson of Boca Raton, Fla. Mrs. Arvidson was convicted of one count of conspiracy and two of mail fraud.She could receive up to 15 years in prison and $750,000 in fines at sentencing on March 23.A second defendant, David Rees of Center Point, was found guilty of conspiracy. A third defendant, James Floyd Richards, of San Antonio, was found not guilty on all charges.Judge Sidney Fitzwater of Federal District Court set bond for Mrs. Arvidson at $10,000, pending sentencing. Mr. Rees was freed on his own recognizance.
6382	 1970	a	“I was never worse than third,” he said. “I was behind George Lewis and Ranchos Lejos along the back side, carefully staying wide of them in case they collapsed. They did and I was In front without even trying for it. My horse handled the track well and I thought my chances were good. But once he tired, he lost his rhythm and that did him in. I looked ahead and Dust Com mander kept getting smaller and smaller as he kept going away from me.”Perhaps the most surprising of the dis appointed jocks was Eddie Belmonte, the mod‐fashion‐plate who rode Personality the more highly regarded of John Jacobs's entry. He was a stunning eighth, while his stablemate, High Echelon was in the money as third finisher.“At the three‐eighths pole,” said Eddie, “my horse was full of running. I know him and what he can do. I even was beginning to smell roses. That's how confident I was. We were in good position and everything was breaking good. He was moving nice and beautiful. But some where near the quarter‐pole there was a patch of water on the track.“Now this is a young, inexperienced horse. He's still leading but he's a shadow jumper. You know, he jumps at shadows. When he saw the water he swerved and ducked in and out. He never got back in proper stride. I know he can do better.”Fashion TailoredEddie reached into his locker and fin gered the velvet suit he had especially tailored for the victory party. The trousers are emerald green and the jacket is salmon pink. The colors of the Jacobs family. Per haps he can wear it more happily after the Preakness or Belmont.But the other jock on the other Jacobs starter, Larry Adams, emerged from some misadventures with a third place on High Echelon. The big unpredictable gray also has bad jumping habits.“He jumped across the path in front of the grandstand,” said Larry, shaking his head in disbelief. “It took at least a quar ter of a mile for him to regain momentum and we dropped back to 17th and last place. That should show you how far he had to come and how well he did it.

5032	 1990	a	A Federal judge said today he would approve a plan to liquidate the assets of the American Continental Corporation, Charles H. Keating Jr.'s company that was the parent of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.Under the plan, American Continental's assets would be liquidated over three years to provide partial payment to the company's 25,000 creditors, who are owed $365 million.More than 9,200 creditors participated in a recent vote on the proposal, and 95 percent approved it, said Donald Gaffney, a lawyer for unsecured creditors.The plan was opposed by Mr. Keating and some of his former top executives, who invested in the company's securities. They said it would push them to the end of the creditors' line and make it unlikely they would receive any money.

317	 2017	a	Players from other countries followed the U.S.A. Hockey negotiations closely. Janine Weber, a member of the Austrian national team, said many European women’s players shared news of the boycott on Facebook.“I think it’s something we can all relate to and something we hope to accomplish one day in terms of equal support from our federations,” Weber wrote in an email, adding that more investment would help close the performance gap between the United States and Canada and the rest of the world in women’s hockey.Jongah Park, a forward on South Korea’s national team, said that even though women’s hockey was a relatively new sport in her country, her team had begun to think about the importance of expanding the game to the point where resources for both genders were equal.“Even we have desire to fight for equal wages and gender equality,” Park wrote in an email during the United States team’s boycott. “I don’t know how to do that. But always think of equalities.”American players hope their stance will ultimately assist women’s hockey programs across the world, but they first are focused on increasing diversity in U.S.A. Hockey’s leadership.Currently, only 15 of 91 voting members of its board of directors are women. It is the only national governing body among American Winter Olympic sports with a board that has less than 20 percent women. According to U.S.A. Hockey’s annual guide, the terms of 29 board members end this year.The importance of having strong voices on the board was clear in the contract negotiations.Meghan Duggan, the national team captain, is a player representative on the board. To avoid a conflict of interest, she did not vote, but she remained involved in negotiations throughout, acting as a channel for the concerns of her 22 teammates.

463	 2016	a	Dear Diary:This Passover, I ran into the Prophet Elijah on the Amtrak platform in New Rochelle.I am old, and I had already dragged my luggage through the caverns of Union Station in Washington only to miss my train home to New York. Back to the counter to buy another ticket, this one for a slower train.When we finally got into the tunnel under Pennsylvania Station, I fell fast asleep. I awoke as we were leaving the station heading north. By the time I got off at the next stop, I had no energy left to drag my luggage up onto the bridge and over the tracks to catch a southbound train.But there, sitting on a bundle of his stuff, sat Elijah. We had, of course, opened the door for him at the Seder. The littlest children were sure he had sipped wine from his special cup.No one actually saw him, but I recognized him by his actions. He said: “Let me take your luggage. I know many of the cabdrivers here. I’ll get you a good price.”

4797	 1991	a	The Journal Company, which owns The Trentonian and eight other daily newspapers, said it was extending a debt exchange offer and would make an overdue bond interest payment. The company said it had received a loan from affiliates of E. M. Warburg, Pincus & Company, its controlling shareholders, to meet a $7.6 million interest payment that was due May 1. The grace period was to have expired today on the semiannual payment on debentures paying 14.825 percent and 14.625 percent interest. The Journal Company, a unit of the Journal Register Company, also said it was extending through June 12 a debt exchange offer announced May 1 that was to have expired Wednesday.
5198	 1989	a	Scientists have found a deficiency of a substance that is important to the normal functioning of cells in a small study of people infected with the AIDS virus.The finding raises the question whether a deficiency of the substance, glutathione, leads to the collapse of the immune system that characterizes AIDS, scientists from the National Institutes of Health said in a report being published today in the British journal Lancet.The study involved 14 men who were infected with the AIDS virus but had no symptoms and 19 men who were not infected. The amount of glutathione was reduced by up to one-half the usual levels in the men infected with the AIDS virus.''We don't know how important the finding is,'' Dr. Ronald G. Crystal, one of the authors, said in an interview.

3209	 2001	a	A security company that was cited for several security lapses at Logan International Airport after Sept. 11 will no longer screen passengers or baggage at the airport under an agreement reached today with the state.The company, Argenbright Security Inc., agreed to the settlement after the state police, upset by the lapses, tried to revoke its license on Nov. 15.The announcement came hours before a scheduled hearing on the Argenbright license issue before a state police board. Col. John DiFava of the state police, Logan's interim security director, said the compromise met his goal: cracking down on mistakes by airport screeners.''It's not a question of trying to blow up Argenbright,'' Colonel DiFava said. ''It's a question of trying to get security at Logan. I was sensitive to the fact that they were fighting for their very survival.''
2245	 2006	a	The only weak part of the season’s new qualifying system is – as has often been pointed out – the first 12 minutes or so of the third and last 20-minute part when the final 10 cars go around in circles doing nothing at all but burn fuel.Cars waiting for the green light in the pit lane moments before the final qualifying session for the U.S. Grand Prix at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Saturday. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy) Cars waiting for the green light in the pit lane moments before the final qualifying session for the U.S. Grand Prix at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Saturday. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy)At Indianapolis today, though, that for me was the highest moment of the weekend so far, for its significance against the backdrop of last year’s U.S. Grand Prix fiasco. There they were, today, a year later, in front of a burgeoning crowd (as opposed to a big one) and nine of the 10 cars in the final session went out together, waiting in the pit lane for the light to turn from red to green before they engaged in a race to burn fuel.The big word is “race.” It was really like a grid line-up as the cars waited and then off the start Fernando Alonso got the better of Michael Schumacher and refused to let him pass. There could be no other reason than to show who is boss. Once they were really into it, though, when it was clear the Spaniard was slower, Alonso let Schumacher pass, and the German acknowledged it with a friendly wave.Even so, there they were, 9 cars going around as if racing against each other – instead of six cars during last year’s race – and these were the fastest cars of the day – unlike last year’s situation – and they were soon to be joined by the tenth. Four more than last year on the Sunday, and more of a race.But it looks as if Michelin has been a little more conservative with their compounds – as the two Ferraris were fastest, and Ralf Schumacher was right up there too on his Bridgestones, in eighth position. Which is great for a guy who does not want to race on the Indianapolis track where he had an accident each of the last two years.The story of the fiasco is now fading into the past. The possibility of a thunderstorm tomorrow could create a different kind of fiasco for the drivers, of course. But will the public think about how when it rains on the Indianapolis 500 there is no race – whereas in Formula One … Donington 1993, Spain 1996, Nurburgring 1999….
3370	 2000	a	City personal income tax cuts first proposed nearly a year ago are finally making their way toward reality, with a City Council committee yesterday approving a scaled-back cut that would save city taxpayers only about $190 million a year, about a quarter of the original plan.The city tax cut, when combined with an already planned state-financed reduction in the local income tax, would result in a combined savings of about $327 next year for a two-child family with an annual income of $100,000. For a single taxpayer earning $25,000 a year, it would translate into about $73 in savings over all.The city tax cut approved by the Council committee yesterday is tentatively set to go into effect Jan. 1, and has already been approved by the State Legislature and endorsed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. It still needs to go before the full Council, which is expected to approve the measure.''The city has enjoyed an incredible fiscal recovery, and now it's time to return some of that money back to our taxpayers,'' Peter F. Vallone, the Council speaker, said yesterday.

2585	 2004	a	It was clear from the moment they took power that President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney were determined to greatly accelerate oil and gas drilling on the public lands of the West. Driven by a belief that energy independence could be achieved by aggressive exploitation of the public domain, the administration set its sights on doubling the number of wells on lands controlled by the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management and urged the environmental community not to block its efforts with frivolous lawsuits.The truth of the matter is that nobody, including conservationists, challenged the government's right or need to look for oil and gas, given the tight markets for both. All anyone asked for was a balanced approach that would broadly respect the requirements of nature and spare particularly fragile landscapes. To the dismay of some Western governors, fish and game commissioners, ranchers and hunters -- many of them lifelong Republicans -- the administration has not produced a balanced policy. Both Washington and the regional B.L.M offices have repeatedly made clear their belief that extraction of oil and gas trumps all other uses of the public lands.This being an election year, the administration is making noises about a more nuanced approach, and has begun to reach out to its critics among the ranchers and sportsmen. There are 90 different land use plans or leasing proposals on the table. Four are especially controversial. How they come out will tell much about whether the administration has had a genuine change of heart.One involves the Rocky Mountain Front, a 100-mile-long stretch of northern Montana wonderfully rich in wildlife. The administration is deciding whether to honor some old drilling leases. Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat, has urged that the leases be bought out and that drilling be barred forever along the Front. The administration should embrace both ideas. While the oil and gas deposits in the Front are trivial, the potential damage from drilling is enormous.
5467	 1987	a	The United States, which has portrayed Iran as the main aggressor in the Persian Gulf war, has strongly protested Iraq's renewed attacks on Iranian targets, State Department officials said today.But Iraq's Ambassador to the United States, Nizar Hamdoon, said that despite the American protest, Iraq would continue its attacks on Iranian offshore oil installations and ships carrying Iranian oil in the gulf.''Iraq never promised anybody we were going to stay idle for a specific time,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''We share the Americans' concern, but we have the right to decide our own policy.'' Iran Attacks Kuwaiti ShipAs Iraq carried out air raids for the third straight day today against Iranian oil targets in the gulf, an Iranian speedboat opened fire with machine guns on a Kuwaiti freighter. The attacks took place as the latest American-escorted convoy of re-registered Kuwaiti tankers headed up the gulf. [ Page A6. ] American officials said it was feared that the new attacks by Iraq might cause Iran to retaliate against the United States convoys.
2851	 2003	a	Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students explore rules of conduct in a political body, first drafting rules that apply to their classroom, then adapting them to political actions in Congress.Author(s):Elyse Fischer, The New York Times Learning NetworkJavaid Khan, The Bank Street College of Education in New York CitySuggested Time Allowance: 1 hourObjectives:In this lesson, students will:1. Discover challenges to civil discussions.2. Examine the issue of incivility in the U.S. Congress through reading and discussion of “The High Costs of Rising Incivility on Capitol Hill.”3. Carefully consider their class rules based on models and experience. Synthesize their research and experience by creating a new set of class rules.4. Apply their research by amending their class rules for Congress.Resources / Materials:–classroom board–pens/pencils–paper–computers with Internet access–four index cards–tape–copies of “The Importance of Rules” from Thomas Jefferson’s A Manual of Parliamentary Practice ( //www.constitution.org/tj/tj-mpp.htm) (one for each student)–poster board–markers (enough for students to share)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Prior to the students’ arrival in class, arrange the desks in a circle (if space allows). Label four index cards, each with one of the following instructions: “Agree with me,” “Disagree with me,” “Ignore me,” and “Interrupt me or tell me to be quiet.”As students enter the room, ask for four volunteers to take part in an exercise in civics and civility. Tape a labeled index card to each volunteer’s forehead or back, so that he or she cannot read the label. Make sure that everyone else in the class, as well as the other discussion participants, can read each card. Ask the students to sit in the circle, with the volunteers in the center. (If you do not have room for a circle, the volunteers may sit in the front of the room.) Explain to the four volunteers that they are going to plan a class party (alternatively, you can have them plan a homework assignment, based on whatever you are studying). Ask them to begin discussing their plans, with one caveat – they must adhere to the instructions printed on their classmates’ cards. The rest of the class observes the discussion.After a few minutes, ask the students to remove their cards and sit down. Facilitate a short whole class discussion, using the prompts below:–How difficult was it for the volunteers to make plans? Why?–What would have helped them make plans?–How did the roles the participants were assigned to play effect the discussion?–Does everyone need to know “the rules” before a discussion can begin?–If we had rules for this discussion, such as “No Interrupting,” how would the discussion have been different?–How do we make sure that people follow the rules that we set up?2. As a class read and discuss “The High Costs of Rising Incivility on Capitol Hill,” using the following questions:a. What did Harry Reid (D-NV) say about the Senate Majority Leader, Bill Frist (R-TN)?b. Why did Mr. Reid make such a remark?c. How does political scientist Ross Baker believe that Congress is a “mirror image of the American people”?d. What is the atmosphere described in the House and Senate?e. About what legislation were Democratic leaders “shut out” of talks?f. According to scholars who study Congress, why are Americans worse for such partisan behavior?g. To what sort of procedural tactics are both parties resorting?h. Why do the “spectacles” described in the article lower the public’s opinion of Congress as an institution? How is this reflected?i. What historical examples of “unpleasantness” are cited in the article?j. How do the Jeffersonian rules attempt to keep civility in the Congress?k. Why are cross-party friendships increasingly rare?l. What steps has the House taken to address the incivility?m. Senator Olympia Snowe, a moderate Republican from Maine, is “deeply” concerned. What has she said about the partisanship in Congress?n. Senators Bill Frist (R-TN) and Charles Schumer (D-NY) are both see “hopeful signs.” Cite examples from the article that “things aren’t as bad as they seem.”o. Does Ross Baker, the political scientist, agree with Senators Frist and Schumer?3. After reading and discussing “The High Costs of Rising Incivility on Capitol Hill,” divide students into small groups. In their groups, ask the students to reflect upon the Warm-Up exercise. In addition, have students look at the existing House rules for debate and decorum ( //www.house.gov/rules/house_rules_text.htm) or Thomas Jefferson’s A Manual of Parliamentary Practice – “The Importance of Rules”( //www.constitution.org/tj/tj-mpp.htm). Using their own experiences, as well as the written models to guide them, students examine and amend the class’s existing rules for discussion, or, draft their own class discussion rules. All rules should attempt to ensure civility upon enforcement. With their rules, students must include a respectful method of enforcement.4. WRAP UP/HOWEWORK: Students continue to draft or amend class discussion rules. Either on a poster or in a letter to their members, students then amend their class rules for the needs of Congress. Allow students to present both sets of rules in a future class.Further Questions for Discussion:–Does having rules ensure people will obey them? Why or why not–Can rules make people civil? Do they help? Explain.–How might incivility get in the way of important discussions or debate?–How do you react when others are not listening to you? How do you feel when people are being rude?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on thoughtful participation in both whole-class and small group discussions and carefully considered rules for both the class and Congress.Vocabulary:chamber, civility, pique, amateur, transcend, partisanship, initiatives, procedural, tactic, filibuster, inflames, evicted, recriminations, righteous, replete, Pecksniff, sniveling, abolitionist, impugn, disparage, censured, bare-knuckles, retreat, centrist.Extension Activities:1. Many schools employ an honor code. What is an honor code? Does it ensure civility? Do you believe that your school should employ an honor code? Why or why not? Write an editorial for your school newspaper.2. “The High Costs of Rising Incivility on Capitol Hill” refers to two important pieces of legislative initiatives: the Medicare prescription drug measure and the energy bill. Research one of the initiatives. In a report, indicate what the measure is supposed to do, the major arguments both for and against, some of the “partisan compromises” in the initiative, how members voted, and what procedures both Republicans and Democrats used for or against passage.3. Look at “A Manual for Parliamentary Practice” by Thomas Jefferson. Imagine that you have been asked to re-write one section for today’s Congress. Using clear and concise language, “translate” a section of Jefferson’s manual.4. Examine partisanship and the role that it plays in your state and municipal leadership. On a chart, indicate the political affiliations of your state and municipal leadership. Find an example of an issue on which state and/or municipal leaders were divided by party. Find an example of an issue in which leaders worked across parties.Interdisciplinary Connections:American History- Research and report upon an incident of partisan conflict in Congress. For instance, you may report upon the caning of Senator Charles Sumner, or the censure of Senator Joseph McCarthy.Fine Arts- Look at a selection of political cartoons online [such as those at The New York Times cartoon page (www.nytimes.com/pages/cartoons/) or at Daryl Cagle’s site (//cagle.slate.msn.com/)] Draw a political cartoon that reflects the incivility in the U.S. Congress. Alternatively, you may decide to interpret a cartoon about bipartisanship.Global Studies- The United States is not alone in incivility among its leaders. Research the procedures that another representative democracy uses to keep its elected officials “civil.”Media Studies- Do you think that televising debate in Congress has made it more partisan and volatile? Does conflict make for better coverage? Watch political news for a few days. Keep a journal of what you watch. At the end of week, decide whether the news would have been equally as compelling (or not) if political conflicts and squabbles remained untelevised.Other Information on the Web:The Official Web site of the Library of Congress (//thomas.loc.gov/) provides access to government databases and information on congressional activity, with schedules and transcripts from some of the congressional hearings.Congress.org ( //congress.org/congressorg/home/) provides details on current issues and is a place to research Congressional voting records.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8United States History Standard 8- Understands the institutions and practices of government created during the Revolution and how these elements were revised between 1787 and 1815 to create the foundation of the American political system based on the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

886	 2014	a	TYLER--Ruth Ann 1931-2014 Ruth Ann Tyler, a native of Shawnee, Oklahoma and a fifty-five year resident of Port Washington, NY, died unexpectedly on October 26th with her life-partner, Barbara Scheid, by her side. Ruth Ann was the daughter of the late Frances V. and Claude Tyler of Shawnee, Oklahoma and was predeceased by her brother, John Tyler, M.D., of Austin, Texas. A Phi Beta Kappa honor graduate of the University of Oklahoma, Ms. Tyler became a Field Representative for the Kappa Kappa Gamma Women's Fraternity after graduation. She traveled throughout the United States and Canada to provide administrative support to the Fraternity's chapters. Ruth Ann completed the Harvard-Radcliff Program in Business Administration before joining the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1956. She rapidly advanced in several positions until she was named Chief of the Personnel Services Division in 1961. Ruth Ann remained one of the few female Officers of the Federal Reserve Bank until her retirement. While employed, Ruth Ann received an advanced degree from the American Banking Association's Stonier Graduate School of Banking at Rutgers University, now part of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. A perpetual "Sooner" football fan, Ruth Ann was an avid sportswoman throughout her life. She played tennis and golf, but above all, she was a passionate boater. Ruth Ann and Barbara spent countless hours sailing the Long Island Sound and traveling the Intercoastal Waterways from New York to Florida in both sailboats and power boats. Ruth Ann was a former member, president and treasurer of the Port Washington Estates Association. Ruth Ann and Barbara were married on January 20, 2014. In July, they celebrated 49 years of partnership. Ruth Ann is survived by her life-partner and wife, Barbara Scheid, their nieces and nephews, many friends and neighbors, all of whom will miss her dry sense of humor and generosity. Visitation will be held on Sunday, November 2, at the Austin F. Knowles Funeral Home, 128 Main Street, Port Washington. Calling hours are 2 to 4pm and 7 to 9pm. A celebration of her life and prayer service will commence at 8:30pm.
5151	 1989	a	Former Prime Minsiter Ciriaco De Mita said today that he had resigned as president of the Christian Democrats, thus ending seven years in the leadership of Italy's dominant political party. Mr. De Mita said he was concerned the party ''gives the impression of being in a different frequency from mine.''
808	 2014	a	WAXLER--Barbara Cushman, beloved wife, sister, mother, and daughter, died peacefully on June 3, 2013, surrounded by loved ones. An attorney for more than 50 years, she had been a resident of Ardmore, Pennsylvania, where she practiced trusts and estates law. Barbara was raised in Brooklyn and, later, Larchmont, New York.

Following Columbia, she practiced law, was a member of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, and attended medical school in New York City. She married Dr. Edward Bernard Waxler in June 1965. They lived in New York, Philadelphia, and, then, in Waycross, Georgia, where Dr. Waxler was a partner in a cardiology practice. Following her husband's death in 1977 at the young age of 37, Barbara relocated to the Main Line suburbs of Philadelphia with her two children, Andrew and Caroline. She was admitted to the bar in Pennsylvania. She is survived by her son, Dr. Andrew Reed Waxler (Laurie); grandchildren, Eric, Abigail, and Emily Waxler; daughter, Caroline Waxler Levitt (Michael); and sister, Joan Rosenberg. She was predeceased by her parents, Dr. Meyer and Beatrice Molinsky, of Larchmont, New York, and her husband, Dr. Edward Bernard Waxler. The interment took place at West Laurel Hill Cemetery. Barbara is sorely missed by her numerous friends and family.

5106	 1989	a	Sergio Leone, the Italian director who revived western films in the 1960's and added distinction and style to a genre known as spaghetti westerns, died of a heart attack yesterday at his home in Rome. He was 67 years old.Mr. Leone, who co-wrote many of his films, gained fame and catapulted Clint Eastwood to international stardom by directing and co-writing three violence-packed hits, ''A Fistful of Dollars,'' ''For a Few Dollars More'' and ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.'' The protagonists were cool, laconic, beleagured loners dueling in a spare sun-blanched terrain.The director, who hailed John Ford as his mentor, said, ''All the killings in my films are exaggerated because I wanted to make a tongue-in-cheek satire on run-of-the-mill westerns.'' Another guideline was that women were introduced only if they advanced the plots. Otherwise, he said, a love situation ''arrests the rhythm of a story.'' 'Strength and Simplicity'''The cowboy picture has got lost in psychology,'' he told an interviewer. ''The West was made by violent uncomplicated men, and it is this strength and simplicity that I try to recapture in my pictures.''
5081	 1989	a	Du Pont is ingrained here. It built this place - invented it, admirers say - at the height of the Cold War, after President Harry S. Truman told the company's chairman that the giant chemical concern, a military contractor since the time of the Revolution, was best qualified for the job. Describing the job at the time as ''probably the largest industrial project ever attempted,'' Du Pont agreed to do it for costs plus one dollar.But for a decade engineers and scientists have worried about the age of the reactors, and in recent months the Department of Energy has expressed dismay about worker attitudes, pollution and the condition of equipment.Now Du Pont has decided to quit, reasoning that in the nuclear industry that has grown up since work started here, others now have more expertise. But the departure is a bit like the mustering out of a Vietnam veteran, whose sacrifice is respected but whose work, at the end, is a subject of ambivalence. No Applause''There is no applause from the Department of Energy, and we expect none,'' said James E. Conaway, who came here with Du Pont in 1951 and is now director of manufacturing for its Atomic Energy Division, at a dinner gathering of the ''25-Year Club'' recently. ''Gratitude is perhaps the most fragile human emotion.''When the country asked for help, he said, ''we did it well.''''We know it,'' he went on. ''Our families know it, and our communities know it. As far as I am concerned, nobody else counts.''In an interview, he stressed that despite the risks postulated by various engineers and occasional accidents over the years, the record was perfect. No one, he said, had been injured by radiation here. Workers were exposed to radiation, in routine operations and in cleaning up after accidents, but the exposures were within government limits, Du Pont officials say.Department of Energy officials are reluctant to talk in detail about the performance of their long-trusted contractor, in part because it reflects poorly on the department's supervision and because the same employees will be doing the work next week.
2309	 2006	a	A lot of blogs are linking to this attack ad on State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi by the G.O.P. [Capitol Confidential.]But has anybody actually seen it on TV? [The Daily Politics.]Huh. So now we can blame Hevesi for terrorism too? [Urban Elephants.]A plea for perspective: The Wonkster at Gotham Gazette asks, “Is what Alan Hevesi did so bad? Or so different? What’s the alternative?”Faith-based voting, from Freddy Ferrer: He’s voting for Mr. Hevesi “with the full expectation” that he’ll be replaced as comptroller. “Elections such as this,” he says, are “a leap of faith. But I have a lot faith in Eliot Spitzer.” Do we have many elections like this? He’s not alone, of course. [The Politicker.]Spin Cycle wonders what happens if this Democratic strategy fails: “What if Hevesi wins big? What if Hevesi tells Spitzer and Silver in January that the people have spoken? What if his lawyers tell Spitzer and Silver that acts he engaged in during his first term can’t be a basis for removal in his second term? What if he goes to court to block them? Everybody may think Hevesi’s finished… except for Hevesi.”The Newsday blog was also on hand when J.

4657	 1992	a	Tonight, Israel had further cause for rejoicing when it won a second medal in judo, this one a bronze that went to Shay Oren Smadga in the men's lightweight division (156 1/2 pounds).While the Munich killings had a devastating impact on the sports world, it is generally not dwelt upon by most Israelis, who have since endured countless other terrorist raids and several wars that form important parts of the national fabric. As it turned out, Arad's performance was the sweet close to what had been yet another blood-soaked day in Israel, one in which 2 people were killed and nearly 50 others injured in an explosion at a munitions plant, and in which, several hours later, a Jerusalem policeman was stabbed to death by a Palestinian assailant who in turn was shot and killed.There were evocations of Munich recently when Yediot Ahronot, citing classified documents reportedly obtained from the Bavaria state prosecutor's office, stated that at least eight of the Israeli athletes were killed not by their Palestinian kidnappers but by German police officers during a rescue attempt.The Bavarian Justice Minister, Mathilde Berghofer-Weichner, responded by saying the official investigations had concluded that none of the Israelis died from police fire, and denied knowledge of any contrary evidence.But instead of Munich and its painful memories, most Israelis preferred today to focus on Yael Arad and her moment of glory (although a few people could not hide their glee over the fact that she had defeated a German to reach the finals).Arad, one of five children in a family from Herzliya on the Mediterranean coast just north of Tel Aviv, has been the standout of a 31-member Israeli team that has thus far failed to dazzle.She took up judo at the age of 8, and says that since completing her compulsory army service five years ago she has dedicated herself almost exclusively to the sport, including annual trips to Japan for training sessions. Last year, she finished third in the European judo championship.
5130	 1989	a	They call it ''biaotai,'' and it is a standard technique of Chinese Communism revived by the recent anti-Government upheaval and its suppression.The word means ''to express an attitude.'' What happens is that people in offices, institutes, schools and the military all over the country are called on to express their attitude about recent events.The performance, a Chinese said, is just that: a performance that does not necessarily reflect what the speaker thinks. Everyone knows what to say, which is currently something like this:''I resolutely support the quelling of the counterrevolutionary rebellion, which was created by a very small number of ruffians whose ultimate goal was the overthrow of socialism and the creation of a capitalist republic for China. China needs above all stability and unity so that it can modernize. I fully support Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech in which he made a penetrating analysis of the causes of the counterrevolutionary rebellion.''The practice of biaotai, which was developed by the Communist revolutionaries even before their victory in 1949, has given rise to a different, bittersweet term, ''shuo wei xin hua,'' which means ''to speak against your heart.''

5541	 1986	a	Six former owners and employees of two Manhattan after-hours clubs were indicted yesterday on charges that they evaded liquor and tax laws and then conspired to impede investigations of those crimes.Attorney General Robert Abrams, in announcing the indictments, said the six men had operated the clubs ''with a complete disregard for the liquor and tax laws'' and that they ''conspired to bribe and coerce witnesses in order to frustrate our investigation.''Three of the men - who prosecutors said were principals of the clubs, the Mine Shaft and Hell Fire - already face charges under an indictment in December stating that they tried to bribe a witness to leave the state so that he could not testify in the investigation. Yesterday's indictment included those earlier allegations.Both the Mine Shaft, a club at 835 Washington Street that chiefly catered to homosexuals, and Hell Fire, a mainly heterosexual club at 26 Ninth Avenue, near West 13th Street, have been closed since last fall. The Mine Shaft was closed by the city in November under the so-called ''safe sex'' regulations that were issued last year to curb the spread of AIDS. Hell Fire closed voluntarily shortly afterward.

105	 2019	a	Climate change made the stifling heat that enveloped parts of Europe last week much more likely and hotter, researchers said Friday.The heat wave, the second to hit Europe since late June, set temperature records in Paris, as well as in Germany, the Netherlands and other countries. Nuclear reactors in France and Germany were forced to reduce output or shut down because the water used to cool them was too warm.The hot air, which was trapped over Europe after traveling from northern Africa, lingered for about four days. It has since moved north over Greenland, causing the surface of the island’s vast ice sheet to melt at near-record levels.Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.World Weather Attribution, a group that conducts rapid analyses of weather events to see if they are influenced by climate change, said that for France and the Netherlands, the four days of extreme heat last week were a rare event even for a warming world. But it said climate change had made the heat wave at least 10 times more likely. In Germany, the heat wave was at least eight times more likely because of climate change, the group found, and in Britain, where the heat did not linger as long, it was at least two times more likely.
5143	 1989	a	Bistro d'AdrienneSometimes there is no accounting for public taste. When the Bistro d'Adrienne was part of the French-run Hotel Maxim's de Paris, the food was very good and the room had class - yet the place was empty. Now, under the Peninsula Hotel Group, the food is still very good but the room has no class - and the place is full.The hotel still has two restaurants on the second floor. The maitre d'hotel who greeted us explained the approach of each: ''On that side,'' he said, pointing to the larger room, ''it's classic . . . you know, heavy French food. On this side is a bistro: sandwiches, salads and that kind of stuff.'' We chose the bistro.The menu is appealing and, considering the locale, not unreasonably priced. We waited 20 minutes at the bar even though two tables were empty and awaiting silverware. When finally seated, we remained waterless, breadless and menuless for another 10 minutes. Our waiter could have been an understudy on ''Fawlty Towers.'' When we ordered, his standard reply was ''Huh?'' We resorted to pointing at the menu - one veloute of red peppers ($6), one oxtail terrine ($7.50) - and he scribbled. Then he served us two consommes. ''I asked for oxtail terrine,'' I said. ''Yes, one oxtail,'' he replied. ''And that isn't tomato veloute,'' I added. ''Yes, tomato veloute,'' he declared confidently.Another waiter came to the rescue. When the correct dishes arrived, they were attractive and well seasoned. So too were entrees of poached fresh cod fillet rolled around a ripe tomato salad, all in a sparkling broth with turned vegetables and aioli ($16.50); and a light, herby navarin of lamb ($18.50).

186	 2018	a	It’s always sweater weather for Samuel Barsky.Oh look! There he is standing in front of the skating rink at Rockefeller Center wearing a sweater adorned with ice skaters. That’s him too at the Luxor hotel in Las Vegas with a pyramid on his chest. And last summer he posted a photograph on Instagram in front of Niagara Falls with a sweater depicting (what else?) the famous waterfalls.Coincidence? No.For nearly 20 years Mr. Barsky, 43, has been knitting sweaters of familiar landscapes and, in recent years, posting photographs of himself posing in front of them, wearing his matching jumper.So far, he has created 119 sweaters in all — including scenes of the Golden Gate Bridge, the Twin Towers, Stonehenge and Jerusalem’s Western Wall — which he has chronicled by year on his website.
1941	 2008	a	Mike Lowell was bothered by a torn labrum in his left hip, so he had one hit in Boston’s last 11 games. J.D. Drew has been hampered by a strained lower back, so he played in only two of the last 38 games.But, when the Red Sox opposed the Los Angeles Angels in Game 1 of their division series on Wednesday night, Drew was batting fifth and playing right field and Lowell was batting seventh and playing third base. The playoffs are here and the Red Sox hope the two sidelined regulars are ready.“I think J.D. had probably his best day in a while yesterday, so that was really good,” said Red Sox Manager Terry Francona. “And, again, there are some off days that help. Mikey Lowell did, I don’t want to speak out of turn, I think he actually did better than we thought.”Eventhough Drew has been out longer, Lowell’s injury seems to be of more concern to the Red Sox. Francona said Boston’s best team has Lowell at third and Kevin Youkilis at first. He joked that Lowell is “not running the 100 meters in the Olympics” and is “not that fast to begin with.”If Lowell’s injury prevents him from scoring from second base on a single, Francona said the Red Sox would consider making a change. But Francona stressed that Lowell, who was the Most Valuable Player in the World Series last year, has earned the right to show whether he can contribute.“This kid has handled so much adversity,” Francona said. “This really hurts. I’m sure it’s painful, what he’s gone through and his willingness to play, he deserves a chance here.”

1950	 2008	a	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — The 2007 game between Florida and Georgia will be remembered for Georgia’s excessive celebration that propelled the Bulldogs to victory.That move angered Florida’s head coach, Urban Meyer, so much that he ordered his team not to comment on it this week. And if Florida’s 49-10 victory wasn’t enough of an answer, Meyer used a bit of return gamesmanship when he called two timeouts in the final minute to extend the daylong toast to Florida football. Meyer kept a straight face when asked about the timeouts after the game.“Moody was running the ball real hard and I wanted to get him a couple of more carries,” he said of the reserve tailback Emmanuel Moody. “He deserved that right.”Asked if people could perceive it as rubbing it in, he said: “No. I was just trying to win a game. That’s all we’re trying to do is win a game. We tackled really well on defense.”Georgia Coach Mark Richt wasn’t as impressed. Asked about the timeouts he gave a stoic response.“The rules say you can have three timeouts per half,” he said. “He used them. That’s perfectly legal to do. There’s nothing wrong with that.”Meyer was pressed on the issue, and he kept coming back to the same topic, “tackling well.”“We tackled very well, that’s what we did,” Meyer said. “That’s the only answer. If anyone says there’s another way to answer a loss the previous year. The only thing we’re answering to is a loss, that’s it.”He paused and then said: “Boy, our guys tackled well. Make sure you put that in there. I don’t see you writing. Write that down.”Let it be written, this rivalry has a new chapter.
4908	 1990	a	Ah yes, we all remember. We remember everything. I do, and it is not because I'm especially sentimental. (The beige silk taffeta went to the Salvation Army a long time ago.) It is as if a hammer and chisel wielded by . . . the fates, maybe . . . had pounded the scene into my brain. Let me call it up, and I see the chilly December day, the gray-haired judge, the fireplace banked in red carnations, and my darker red shoes. Capezios. I see the groom, in dark blue, and his hands, which were sporting the first manicure he ever had. I had a manicure, too, my fourth and last. Three high school junior proms, one wedding: no gala since has matched those four. Ergo, no more manicures.The champagne was in the bathtub, two dozen bottles or so heaped on big chunks of ice, and my roommate and I had iced the petits fours ourselves. My new sister-in-law had done the flowers, and an hour or two before the ceremony my mother had gone to Bergdorf's, the store nearest her hotel, to buy me a blue garter. My sister's bouquet - she was maid of honor - trembled in her hand, and the wedding cake was a disappointment. I had wanted a fruit cake; this was a white cake. Like I said, I - we - remember everything.My younger daughter imagines her wedding - ''Long white dress, band and a professional makeup job,'' she snaps - and is much in demand as a bridesmaid. Her college classmates are getting married now, and I suppose she will be among them one of these days. Their weddings are elaborate and expensive and followed by sit-down dinners - none of this standing in a meadow and promising ''so long as we both shall dig it'' stuff. ''You'll get no such nonsense from me,'' I promise. ''Only watercress sandwiches and a harpist.'' I mean it, too.But I'll buy her a blue garter anyway, and be wet-eyed when I see her in her dress (''off-the-shoulder, with a little waist,'' she tells me). After the guests are gone, I'll get into my old gray bathrobe and take out the old photograph albums and breathe a sigh of relief - that my child is settled down at last. Which is stupid of me because it is decades since marriage was equivalent to settling down at last and because it is a relationship about which I am, to say the least, ambivalent.My ambivalence is less out of my own experience than out of what I perceive of others' experience. But I cannot quite trust these perceptions because no outsider can penetrate the wall that surrounds somebody else's marriage. Even so, too often I do not like what I see.
1400	 2011	a	What a difference four years make.In the race for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination, the candidates Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee seemed to take every chance to disparage each another. Each took potshots at the other’s stands on the issues and their track records. Once, Mr. Romney even criticized Mr. Huckabee, who upended Mr. Romney’s plans to win the Iowa caucuses with a surprise victory, for his diction.But on Saturday night, when Mr. Huckabee, now a Fox News host, interviewed his former rival on his show about Mr. Romney’s 2012 campaign, things were different. They sat smiling and occasionally offering compliments. They were polite.For some perspective, here is a representative television appearance by the two from 2008 campaign. (The captions are not by The New York Times.)On Saturday, Mr. Huckabee, who is not running for president this year, said to his guest that many viewers had tuned in wondering, “Would you and I be able to sit in the same room and be civil to each other?”“I think we’ve proven that people can be civil.”And that was, perhaps, because Mr. Huckabee seemed to pull some of the punches that might have been irresistible four years ago.At one point, Mr. Romney replied to an abortion-rights question by saying he believed that life began at conception, and he spoke of his desire to see the United States Supreme Court’s landmark abortion rights decision, Roe v. Wade, overturned. Immediately afterward, he seemed to draw less of a hard line, saying he would leave the decision to permit the procedure up to the states.In response, Mr. Huckabee likened that approach to the conditions in the country before the Civil War, but he just as quickly abandoned that idea.Four years ago, Mr. Huckabee, who opposes abortion rights, frequently used Mr. Romney’s less-stringent stance as ammunition, and framed Mr. Romney’s view as “flip-flopping.”But there were smiles and cordiality on Saturday night. Mr. Romney even asked Mr. Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas, why he had not entered the fray this year. (His response was that he could not run and also continue his television show.) Mr. Romney went so far as to say it would have been “terrific” if Mr. Huckabee had once again run.
2457	 2005	a	PASS CHRISTIAN, Miss., Aug. 31 - Dave Bernzweig saw them as soon as he peered inside the small brick house: two more lost souls, wedged among the soaked ruins of their belongings. He recorded the location of the bodies, between the front door and the flowered couch, then moved across the street, where another victim of Hurricane Katrina lay.Mr. Bernzweig and his colleagues from Ohio Task Force One, a division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency hunting for storm survivors with dozens of other search and rescue teams on the Gulf Coast, have punishing work ahead of them. In this area of coastal Mississippi lashed hard when the eye of the hurricane passed just to the west, they are looking for the living in dangerous, putrid mountains of debris that too often hold only the dead. The heat is excruciating, and the stench of detritus, even in areas where no one has died, turns stomachs."We go now, on Day 3, by the smells," said Doug Cope, the search team manager, "just like the dogs."The team from Ohio spent most of Wednesday in "blitz mode," searching Pass Christian, a community on the eastern side of St. Louis Bay, for people who might be trapped in pancaked homes. They worked in pairs with dogs that sniffed each rubble pile for traces of human scent, but had found no one by midafternoon. On Tuesday, other teams scouring the neighborhood found at least eight people. They also found many dead pets and two live snakes, including a poisonous copperhead.

7527	 1964	a	HOUSTON, Nov. 30 — The baseball franchise of Richmond in the International League was sold today to Toledo, Ohio, but the team will continue to operate as the leading minor‐league affiliate of the New York Yankees.The sale, announced at the annual meetings of the major and minor leagues, will bring Toledo back into the high minor leagues after an absence of 10 years. The club had played in the American Association as the Mudhens and then the Glass Sox until 1954.The team at Richmond had been owned by the Yankees untill two years ago, when it was bought by Romeo Champagne, a supermarket executive from Manchester, N. H. Last season it played to only 148,000 persons, continuing a decline that had started about three years ago.Champagne sold the franchise to the Lucas County Recreation Commission in Ohio for a price that was reported to be between $90,000 and $100,000.
1084	 2013	a	WIENER--Sally Ann Dixon, of Manhattan and Aquinnah, died at her NY home on November 13th. Born in Burlington, Iowa on September 18, 1926 to George and Ellen Dixon. Sally attended Tucson High School and earned a degree in Journalism from the University of Arizona. Beginning with her "junior year abroad" at Barnard College, she loved New York City and after writing for dailies in the west she returned to work for several papers in New York. She wrote short stories under the name Samuel Devon Warner.

4807	 1991	a	To its enormous credit, the Bolshoi Opera chose boldness over mere middlebrow prudence. After Tchaikovsky's "Yevgeny Onegin" last week, the company could have continued along the same safe path with, say, "Boris Godunov" and "The Queen of Spades." Instead, on Friday night at the Metropolitan Opera House, it offered a real rarity, Rimsky-Korsakov's opera-ballet "Mlada," to be followed on Wednesday by Tchaikovsky's almost equally rare "Maid of Orleans."Such repertory, along with younger singers less known in the West than some older Bolshoi standbys, represents a deliberate choice by the Moscow company's current leadership, in place since 1988: Aleksandr Lazarev, the artistic director and chief conductor; Boris Pokrovsky, stage director, and Valery Levental, designer. They want to rediscover lost Russian masterpieces, enliven stodgy production styles and showcase young talent.All noble aims, but, lamentably, noble aims don't automatically translate into artistic success. Like the other two stagings presented here, this "Mlada" is a direct product of the leading troika, even though on Friday Mr. Lazarev was still fulfilling a prior commitment in Duisburg, Germany, of all unlikely places. First seen in Moscow in 1988 and presented, to acclaim, in Glasgow last summer, the production seemed a muddled failure, colorful, refreshingly unliteral but profoundly confused. If the Russians don't take their own exotica seriously, they can hardly expect Westerners to do so.Rimsky himself called his score "cold -- like ice." On Friday it seemed more lukewarm -- like mush. The whole enterprise, score and production both, with clumsily juxtaposed elements and fussy distancing devices -- along with the inexplicable absence of supertitles, which will be used in the Bolshoi performances at Wolf Trap near Washington next week -- diluted the vibrant aspects of the piece, canceling them out in confusion.

111	 2019	a	Sanders and Warren had the sharpest messagesThe race’s two leading progressives, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, dominated Tuesday night’s debate by defending their uncompromising vision against more moderate ideas. Over and over, as centrist candidates argued that Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren’s policies were impractical, they made their case that Mr. Trump was not the root of America’s ills, and advocated, as Ms. Warren calls it, “big, structural change.”They were helped by two factors. They had significantly more name recognition — and support in the polls — than the people who were attacking them, including former Representative John Delaney of Maryland and former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado. With them as a foil, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren were able to more easily remain above the fray. However, there is also an ease in defending the progressive vision, because it is aspirational. While other candidates are forced to argue about political possibilities and moderation, the two senators can think bigger and bolder, and ask the audience to do the same.The hard question for both, which they have avoided on the debate stage to this point, involves how they would pass their policies in a polarized Washington. And many Democrats remain worried that a message of radical change could be perilous in a general election, noting that moderates had a strong track record in the 2018 midterms and that Mr. Obama and President Bill Clinton came from the center of the party.
3790	 1997	a	Bud Selig, who has been called the acting commissioner by people in and out of baseball for four and a half years, is not the commissioner of Major League Baseball, a Federal judge ruled yesterday.Judge Lewis Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan rendered that decision in rejecting the attempt of an owner of minor league baseball teams to block an arbitration that will determine the amount the Florida Marlins must pay for taking the territory of the Miami Miracle.Marvin Goldklang, who owns the Miracle and is also a limited partner in the Yankees' ownership, had contended that proper procedure had not been followed in the appointment of a seven-man arbitration panel. He based his argument on the contention that Selig has, in reality, been the commissioner since Fay Vincent was ousted from the position in September 1992.In a six-hour deposition taken Jan. 17, Selig said he was only chairman of the executive council, which served as commissioner in the absence of a commissioner and made all decisions.

2971	 2002	a	With Washington focused on corporate responsibility, Vice President Dick Cheney's tenure as chief executive of Halliburton is under scrutiny from government investigators and his political opponents.Most of the attention has been focused on a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into changes made by the company in its accounting practices for construction projects while Mr. Cheney led Halliburton.But the company and its shareholders have also suffered from the hidden costs from a deal that was, at the time, the high point of Mr. Cheney's five-year Halliburton career: his acquisition in 1998 of Dresser Industries. The deal, which Mr. Cheney hailed as a ''win-win'' merger, ended up saddling the company with the growing costs of legal claims from people who say they were injured by or are at risk from asbestos in products made by Dresser and a former Dresser subsidiary that was spun off in 1992.Mr. Cheney's office said the Halliburton-Dresser deal was thoroughly vetted at the time. Halliburton said the degree of the asbestos problems could not have been anticipated at the time of the merger.
5234	 1988	a	The Mets staged their first full workout of spring training today and delivered some theater to their new audience on Florida's Gold Coast. Dwight Gooden pitched batting practice for the first time and fired the heater past sluggers like Gary Carter and Darryl Strawberry.It was a bit of old magic in a new setting, and while it didn't count in anybody's batting or pitching records, it did startle the fans and the players. This was a no-nonsense Gooden, revving up for the first time this spring, for the first time since he lost his bid for a raise in salary arbitration and took a $100,000 cut instead.''He was overpowering,'' Strawberry said. ''He looks a lot stronger this year. The way he threw today, I'd have to say he's throwing more like the year when he won the Cy Young Award.''''I didn't think he was going to be throwing that hard the first time out, but he was popping it,'' Strawberry said. ''A lot of people asked me, is he throwing hard? I said step in and see for yourself.'' Fastball 'Three Weeks Away'
1709	 2009	a	Reed Saxon/Associated PressAs expected, Michael Jackson had several of the best-selling albums in the country last week as fans rushed to stores and download services in the days after his death last Thursday.Three titles by Mr. Jackson each had more than 100,000 sales in the United States in the week that ended Sunday: “Number Ones” sold 108,000, “The Essential Michael Jackson” sold 102,000 and “Thriller” — which was reissued last year in multiple commemorative versions — sold 101,000, according to preliminary sales data from Nielsen SoundScan that was reported by Billboard. (Mr. Jackson’s music is released by divisions of Sony Music Entertainment.) By contrast, the top-selling new album was the Black Eyed Peas‘ “The E.N.D.” (Interscope), with 88,000 copies.But because of Billboard’s rules, Mr. Jackson’s albums do not qualify for the Billboard 200, its standard albums chart, because they were all released more than 18 months ago. Instead, the Black Eyed Peas album is at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, and Mr. Jackson occupies the top nine slots on the Billboard catalog chart, as either a solo artist or member of the Jackson 5, a record for that chart.In total, Mr. Jackson sold 415,000 albums in the United States last week, according to the preliminary numbers; final numbers are expected on Wednesday. The week before, he sold only 10,000, and last week’s total is 40 percent more than Mr. Jackson’s entire catalog had sold for the year up to June 21, Billboard reported Tuesday night.A remarkable 2.6 million songs by Mr. Jackson as a solo act or with the Jackson 5 were downloaded digitally through last Sunday, the standard end of the sales week of the SoundScan tracking service, upon whose numbers Billboard bases its charts. (Downloads for the week before were 48,000.) A total of 58 percent of the sales last week were downloads, and Mr. Jackson has become the first artist to sell more than a million song downloads in a single week.Many retailers reportedly ran out of available stock of CD’s, and for days after Mr. Jackson’s death his albums occupied most of the top slots on the running music sales charts for iTunes and Amazon.com.

2455	 2005	a	OF all the seasons, autumn can be the most fickle. With the arrival of in-between weather -- warmer than winter but spiked with rain and frigid breezes -- an insulated vest comes in handy, particularly for those who prefer to exercise outside.Thanks to innovations in fabrics and design, today's outdoor vests are light, sleek and practical.Here are five that run the gamut from ultralightweight to bulky.Keep in mind, a heavier vest is not necessarily a warmer one. Base your choice on what kind of exercise you'll do while wearing it. CHRISTIAN DeBENEDETTICloudveil Inversion, $135, www.cloudveil.com (available online in mid-September). This vest's exterior is tough, water-repellent nylon, making it a sound choice for skiers and casual hikers alike. Inside is pillowy 650-fill down, enough to keep a person warm in a cold wind. Yet at only 10 ounces, the vest is light, and it can be stuffed into a grapefruit-size sack (included).

4104	 1995	a	BURSTING a speculative bubble is easy for a central banker. Doing so without killing a lot of innocent bystanders is not. Alan Greenspan may have accomplished the task.The operative phrase is "a lot," and there are many people who would disagree with it. Certainly there were many speculators who suffered greatly as a result of the Federal Reserve's tightening of credit, including some who did not know they were speculating. But the Fed managed to unwind huge speculation on interest rates with only minimal damage to the stock market and the economy.The bubble was, to be sure, in large part a creation of Mr. Greenspan. When the American banking system was reeling from the effect of bad loans in 1990, the Fed and its chairman helped to engineer a prolonged period of falling interest rates and -- perhaps more importantly -- a very steep yield curve. With short rates much lower than long rates, banks could pay less for deposits and make a nice profit buying government bonds.As time went on, more and more people began to play that game, and to convince themselves they were geniuses because the money rolled in. The derivatives market made it easier to make those bets, and easier to conceal from the unsophisticated just what was being done. Getting out of the way when Mr. Greenspan changed the rules in February required nimble footwork that few could manage, and 1994 produced a line of humiliated speculators including Piper Jaffray's Worth Bruntjen and Orange County's Robert Citron.
2177	 2006	a	“We laugh at your religion, you people of the sand.” — Ronnie James DioLast Friday’s sermon verged on the venomous.The preacher’s words were pregnant with anger, trembling with the coveted emotion irrepressible from generation to the next : “O Dear prophet, shall thee be insulted and we are millions!”Examples followed, some of them involving slaying, and at the end, murmurs of approval and wrath were exchanged amongst the people in the mosque. I felt uncomfortable with the scene, seeking counsel, I looked to the right. Ali, lead-guitarist in our no-particular-place-to-go heavy metal band, Hamballah, was serenely picking his nose. I felt gutted. I prayed. I walked out with a bad taste in my mouth.The sermon addressed the act of Danish newspapers publishing caricatures that ridiculed the Islamic prophet Muhammad. This act was naturally taken heavily by the hordes of stressed Muslims, and showed the real, unflinching public image of Islam in the eye of the common people of the West.This puts a cool dude like me in such a tough spot, torn apart by my love for Western rationality but still much endowed with an Eastern devotion to my religion, It was not easy to decide what my own reaction should be.When I first found out about the Abu Ghraib scandals, I wasn’t shocked. I wasn’t angry, insulted or surprised. I didn’t take it personally, even the raping. All I said was, “It’s about time they uncovered this.” Prison sadism is a natural thing driven by human instinct. It happens, regardless of who is on the hitting end and who is on the receiving end.And so are these caricatures natural, too. On one hand, if you think about it rationally for a moment, Islam’s Western image has been run way too far in the mud after Sept. 2001 by the deeds of extremists, Islam’s most notorious inner disease. The image grew darker, less tolerant and more violent day by day. And no countermeasures have been effective enough to stop this. After all, what is equal to blood but blood itself?You should also keep in mind that religious influence is much more rubbery in the West than it is here. It is not taken so seriously in the West: similar treatments have befallen Jesus, Moses and the Almighty himself (Bruce Almighty, anyone?). After all, caricatures are meant to ridicule. The images of the prophet as sexist and barbaric is the natural outcome of all the blood mistakenly shed in the name of Islam.On the other hand, when I first saw these caricatures, I felt an irrepressible anger and wrath. Seeing a character as revered and majestic as the prophet — peace be upon him — humiliated and treated this way made my blood boil, I felt like the animals in George Orwell’s classic “Animal Farm” when the humans destroyed their windmill — an ancient hatred spurred by rational lies and pretexts.On Sunday here in Iraq, six crowded churches were bombed and the civil boycotting of Danish products, heavily advocated by mosques, is now spreading throughout the Middle East. By waging this mad, irrational war on an international scale, Muslims are falling into a trap. The Danish newspaper must have published the drawings as a test, to see how much Islamic extremism has influenced freedom of expression. Since then, the Arab world has split asunder: embassies closed, riots started, bombs exploded. The results of the test seem heavily negative.I knew a real religious Muslim once. He was kind, sweet, friendly, good-natured. One day, some extremist sectarians came along and chopped off his head. Blood is more visible than sweet nothings.
1290	 2011	a	Related Article A Breast-Feeding Plan Mixes Reactions This article prompted e-mails to the Public Editor regarding the use of anonymous blog quotes.Kate Zernike, in her report on Michelle Obama’s effort to promote breast-feeding, went to the blogs to canvas political comment. There, she found a surprising number of people crossing political boundaries to express support or opposition.But reader Michael Denham of Boston questioned the quality of the sourcing of the story, as did other readers who contacted the public editor’s office. Mr. Denham noted a quote in the story that was attributed only as “one person on a blog” – and an anonymous one at that.“One person on a blog does not a citation make,” he wrote in an email. “Upon reading it, I felt uneasy with the utter lack of sourcing.”The story, which was published online Feb. 17, demonstrates a problem inherent in using blogs for quote fodder. If you were to identify a hierarchy of sources by quality, an anonymous blogger would have to occupy the bottom rung, or near it.The Times’s policy on anonymous sourcing describes the use of anonymous sources as a “last resort to obtain information that we believe to be newsworthy and reliable.” The policy goes on to say that the identity of every anonymous source should be known by at least one editor. Unfortunately, it is all but impossible to know the identity of an anonymous blogger.That said, I can see some merit in reporting on how a particular political controversy is playing out in the blogosphere, so long as that is clearly described as the basis of the story.In this case, the story went some distance toward doing this – in the third paragraph, the story said, “On blogs and in interviews, some liberal Democrats found themselves agreeing with Representative Bachmann, a Tea Party celebrity from Minnesota, when she criticized the first lady for a campaign to promote breast-feeding. Some conservatives, meanwhile, stood up for Mrs. Obama for promoting what they said was a healthier choice.”Ms. Zernike told me her reporting included interviews, as well as the blog material, and that interviewees were reluctant to be quoted. The blog material supported what she was hearing in her interviews, she said.“I wouldn’t have taken only blog postings, but given that they backed up what I was hearing elsewhere – and that this was generating so much comment online – they seemed to be relevant,” she said.Rick Berke, the national editor, said, “Kate’s piece tried to capture the huge outpouring on different sides on the blogs.”But she had a difficult time getting people on the record, he said. “I wished we had explained this outpouring and how people did not want to speak for quotation. We should have also better identified the specific blog posts. We generally shy away from anonymous blog quotes.”The Times’s anonymous blog quotes may add color to a story but they don’t bring much more.

5571	 1986	a	The Soviet Union said today that radioactive material was continuing to escape from a damaged nuclear power plant in the Ukraine, but that the chain reaction in the reactor had stopped.Moscow said the emission of radioactive substances had decreased in the last 24 hours.In its third statement in three days about the reactor accident, widely believed by Western authorities to be the worst in the history of nuclear power, Moscow denied Western reports that there had been thousands of casualties. It said 197 people had been hospitalized as a result of the accident, 49 of whom were discharged after examination. Soviet Reported 2 DeathsOn Tuesday the Government reported that two people had been killed and that four settlements around the reactor site had been evacuated.The statement today called the Western reports of heavy casualties ''rumors,'' and a television commentator said the photograph of the plant should convince viewers that the damage had not been extensive. There was no mention of the barrage of criticism from Western governments over Moscow's reluctance to make more information about the accident public.

5458	 1987	a	A police car still sits in front of the house on Gladwin Avenue in Flushing, Queens, a reminder of the arson fire three months ago that turned this quiet street into a symbol of neighborhood resistance to the child-welfare policies of New York City.The outrage that grew before and after the fire April 20 - which led to the arrests of five residents of the street - has subsided. But since July 14, when the first of the babies arrived at the small brick-and-frame house at 171-27 Gladwin Avenue, a sense of anxiety has persisted.Child-care workers there say they have felt uncomfortable at times in their new surroundings.Donna Wilson, a 25-year-old worker, said the mood on both sides had settled into one of ''wait and see.''Yet those in the house also speak of small acts of kindness by their neighbors.And from the patrol car car that guards the house 24-hours a day, an officer said the worst thing that happened was that the mosquitoes really begin biting around midnight.
3459	 1999	a	Teodoro Garcia, a reluctant Mexican lieutenant who battled the rebel Pancho Villa in the Mexican Revolution and is believed to be the last soldier in the army of the dictator Porfirio Diaz, died last Saturday in a retirement home in Texas City, Tex. He was 110.''He was the last Federal,'' said Manuel Urbina 2d, a professor of Latin American history at the College of the Mainland in Texas City, and an expert on the survivors of the Mexican Revolution. ''There are a few, very few, who fought with Villa and others, and who are still alive because they were 11-, 12-, 13-year-old boys, or they fought with later factional governments during the revolution. But Garcia was the last who fought with Diaz.''Mr. Garcia was born into a family of prosperous landowners on Jan. 7, 1889, in Sacramento, in the Mexican state of Coahuila, about 100 miles southwest of Laredo, Tex. Although he sympathized with the poor, he made an offhand promise to a friend that he would join the Federales, a name for Diaz's army, if they ever passed through town. When they did, a few weeks later, the young Garcia felt that as a matter of honor, he had to enlist.Joining the Federales -- the name now refers to the Mexican federal police -- was also somewhat expected of Mr. Garcia. His family, after all, had about 40 peones on its hacienda, and President Diaz was battling civil insurrection. As it turned out, Mr. Garcia fought on the losing side. Diaz, in power since 1876, was overthrown in 1911 by Francisco Madero, with the help of Villa, the revolutionary leader in the north of Mexico, and Emiliano Zapata, the leader in the south.

2258	 2006	a	England and Portugal first met in the World Cup 40 years ago. Alastair Reid wrote about it a couple of months later in The New Yorker in his roundup of England ’66. It’s fascinating to read his account of the match, played when blanket TV coverage of sports, celebrity play-by-play commentators and instant replays (or action replays, as they were called in Britain) were all in their infancy, Bobby Charlton and Eusebio were in their prime, and good feeling reigned on the soccer field.England had never before appeared in a World Cup semifinal, and, almost by sudden instinct, the wise men and soothsayers of football stopped predicting and started holding their breath. One columnist reported fancifully that a strange, flickering blue light hung over the whole country, a kind of television halo, and certainly those who had grumbled the loudest about having to sacrifice some of their favorite television serials for the lavish coverage of the World Cup had by now stopped caring whether or not the serials ever came back. I had watched a fair proportion of the games on television, and not only was the treatment technically beyond reproach but the strange tampering with the sequence of time that television is so easily able to indulge in had become almost part of our expectation. We had grown used not simply to seeing a goal scored but to seeing it over again almost immediately, then possibly a third time, in slow motion, to say nothing of being able to watch it later the same evening, and even the following day. The B.B.C. and Independent Television sportscasters had grown into family friends, as familiar as mailmen. And yet nothing quite equalled the experience of the games themselves, even though the goals were over in a flash, and did not immediately and mysteriously repeat themselves.As I travelled out to Wembley on the Underground for the semifinal, faces seemed grimmer than usual. The touts on the way to the ground were hoarse by this time, the variety of ribboned rosettes had dwindled, and I found myself waving aside programs and surveys, for I now knew all the names by heart and had grown as adept as any of the announcers at identifying the Portuguese. The scandal of the Argentine match was still very much in the air, however, and we wanted above all some kind of restitution—some omen that might make the inconceivable possible. So far, England had leaned heavily on its almost impenetrable defense, and on Gordon Banks, its brilliant goalkeeper, but defense, we knew, would never win against a team as mercurial as the Portuguese, and especially against an opportunist of Eusebio’s calibre. Wembley under the lights seemed as miraculous a setting as we could wish for, and when the teams walked out, the national chant (a staccato sequence of claps followed by a cry of “Eng-land!,” which had first been borrowed from the Brazilians as a battle cry during the World Cup in Chile) had never been so urgent, never so hopeful. If England were to win against a team as dedicated and pure as the Portuguese, the combination of morale and “home advantage” Would obviously make it the favorite for the Cup.The game itself proved to be the turning point of the whole competition. After the ugly incidents, the squabbles, and even the tedium of simply getting the games played out, the game with Portugal seemed a kind of unveiling, a revelation of all that was best in football, a game that must have converted even chess addicts, and that certainly won over clusters of people who had previously done little more than unwillingly suspend their disbelief. From the beginning, both teams seemed to have sworn solemn vows to demonstrate that the kind of fouling that had marred the quarterfinals had absolutely nothing to do with football at its best. The referee, in fact, scarcely had to use his whistle at all, and the spectacle of players helping their opponents up after a fall or patting one another’s backs in appreciation after a particularly brilliant piece of play sent the crowd into a roar. When Charlton scored for England after thirty minutes, the enthusiastic embraces of his teammates were punctuated with Portuguese handshakes, and the shouts that came from the crowd were of appreciation rather than partisanship. More than that, what we saw was a transformed England team, playing not the canny, covering, defensive game of its earlier, economical wins but a swift and deadly attacking game, a game it might have learned overnight from the Portuguese; a fluent, fast, and diagrammatic football, with long, clean passes that seemed always to find their man, the kind of game that would turn the closest of goal-line saves into a sudden spurt of attack down one of the wings; a game that scarcely any of us felt we could look away from long enough to make even the briefest of jottings in our notebooks. My Portuguese neighbor might have been a dedicated English supporter, so vociferously appreciative was he of the spectacle, while we, in our turn, took only delight in the graceful subtleties of Eusebio and José Torres. Bobby Charlton scored again for England with only ten minutes left—a rocketing shot that took him well clear of the ground, and did much the same for the crowd. Even then, Portugal seemed to be only beginning. England handled the ball in the penalty area, and from the consequent penalty kick Eusebio scored superbly for Portugal, sending the goalkeeper diving one way, with a wriggle of his body, and the ball the other. It was Eusebio’s eighth goal of the championship, and it set him up without question for the trophy awarded to the leading scorer. The end was trauma—England ahead two goals to one, and Antonio Simöes poised with the ball, fated, we felt, to score, until little Stiles materialized from nowhere and stole the ball and, we felt, the game. The final whistle had never seemed more of a relief, more of a sibilantly emphatic piece of punctuation. All twenty-two players were as eager to thank their opponents as to embrace one another, to trade shirts, to bask in the ovation of the moment. Eusebio wept as he left the field, and it was only as we were trailing out of the stadium, still dazed by football, that it began to dawn on us that England was in the final.The following day, the press forgot itself in lyrical ecstasies. The front pages all showed us Eusebio either in tears or embracing Bobby Charlton. The economic crisis had retreated to page 3, and nobody seemed to have the time to see Mr. Wilson off to Washington, or even to notice that he had gone, so intent were we on the breathless possibilities ahead. Alf Ramsey pronounced the result England’s greatest victory since he had become manager, and Tass, the Russian news agency, in an uncharacteristic burst of poetic fervor, declared, “The World Cup semifinal between England and Portugal was like a spring of clear water breaking through the murky wave. It was beautiful, correct football.” The Portuguese officials were no less generous in their praise, and, however inglorious the Argentinian game seemed in retrospect, the bad taste it left had been more than obliterated.

2969	 2002	a	But the new crop of tablet PC's represent much more than machines mimicking pen and paper. Computer makers say that technology is forcing handwriting to evolve in terms of how and when it is used. The tablet PC's may not only reflect those changes but also hasten them.''I don't think we are physically losing our ability to write with a pen and pencil, but I do see changes,'' said Edie Adams, manager of hardware user research for Microsoft. For example, she said, handwriting has become more useful as a thinking aid, for taking brief notes and working out ideas. Tablet PC technology is designed to take advantage of this aspect of handwriting -- as ''one to one, or even one to self'' communication, Ms. Adams said.But Microsoft has also had to focus on just how ''dirty'' quick and dirty handwriting can be. Mr. Dixon said that developing the tablet's handwriting recognition software was complicated by the necessity that it be able to recognize a wide range of handwriting styles at a time when many Americans say they can hardly recognize their own.More than one million handwriting samples are written into the tablet's software to help it read and convert handwriting into text. Even so, Microsoft acknowledges that the technology converts handwriting into digital text with varying degrees of success. But developers say that people should expect no more from the technology than they would from the person doing the writing.''If someone takes a handwritten note and the next day they come back and can't read it,'' Mr. Dixon said, ''well, our handwriting recognition engine is not going to do so well on it either. The general rule of thumb is that you get better results with neater handwriting.''For years, computer technology developers have been searching for a reliable and simple means to let people write on their computers as easily as they might type on them. The concept got its first widespread exposure in the mid-1990's with Apple's Newton, a pioneering hand-held computer. But the Newton ultimately failed, as did several more recent attempts, including a pen-based I.B.M. ThinkPad and a Sony Vaio desktop Pen Tablet.Microsoft's effort is by far the most ambitious to convince computer users that the pen can be as logical an addition to the keyboard as the mouse. Like previous proponents of handwriting-recognition software, the company hopes that some users will find it easier to write on a computer screen than use a keyboard.

To make his portraits, he had to visit the Netherlands — where a group of under-20s was gathered for a tournament — as well as Salt Lake City, Dallas and Norway.

1868	 2008	a	We had a nice event at Princeton yesterday — the Graham lecture, given this year by Jon Eaton — and later, over drinks, Jim Harrigan pointed me to an interesting paper by David Hummels and co-authors about international transportation. The interesting point is that for many countries/routes, there isn’t a lot of competition: modern ships are big, and many countries are small.Minimum efficient scale in shipping is significant. The capacity of a modern container ship is large relative to the export volumes produced by smaller countries, and there are substantial economies of scope in offering transport services over a network of ports. One way to see this effect is to calculate the number of carriers operating on a particular trade route. In the fourth quarter 2006 one in six importer-exporter pairs world-wide was served by a single direct liner “service”, meaning that only one ship was operating on that route. Over half of importer-exporter pairs were served by three or fewer ships, and in many cases all of the ships on a route were owned by a single carrierI know, it’s not world-shaking, but I always think it’s interesting to get a sense of the physical reality of trade, which is a lot less seamless than we tend to think.

5418	 1987	a	FOR Horacio Gutierrez, a concert pianist is not unlike a tightrope walker: Juggling artistic needs with career goals can be a constant balancing act.''You have to be very honest that what you are doing is indeed to enhance your artistic growth and not to fit in with the fads,'' said the 38-year-old pianist in an interview the other day. ''You want to do something that you really believe in, not just because it's popular, or because it's a sure-fire way to get an engagement.''Not that getting engagements has been difficult for him. Since winning the silver medal at the 1970 Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow at age 21, Mr. Gutierrez has played and recorded with many of the world's major orchestras. In 1982 he was awarded the $10,000 Avery Fisher Prize, a noncompetitive honor given to young artists in recognition of their musical achievements.On Sunday at 2 P.M., Mr. Gutierrez will play works by Mendelssohn, Schumann, Ravel and Liszt, in a solo recital at the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College, one block from the intersection of Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues. Tickets are $8 to $17; information: (718) 434-1900. 'Old Friends' and New Challenges
4297	 1994	a	The Japanese students, Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura, both 19, were shot in the head on March 25, shortly after they drove to a Ralph's supermarket in San Pedro for some late-night shopping. On Sunday, their parents, who had just arrived from Japan, consented to have them taken off life support. Big News in JapanIn a case that has attracted international attention, Los Angeles Police Chief Willie Williams announced the arrests at a news conference late Wednesday night -- in time for the 11 P.M. news in California and before the evening news in Japan, where the killings of the two film students have confirmed the prevalent view there that the United States is a gun-toting, crime-ridden country.The killings were not racially motivated, Mr. Williams said."The young men were not targeted because of their ethnicity, the fact that they were students, or the fact that they were visitors," he said."We want to send a message to everyone who lives in Los Angeles, who visits Los Angeles, both locally and abroad," he added. "The city of Los Angeles is still a great city; it's a wonderful place to live; it's a wonderful place to work. It is not the most violent city in America. It is not the most violent city in the world." 'Lots of Pieces Missing'The police offered few details about the case, apart from saying that the suspects had been identified on Monday and placed under surveillance. Mr. Williams said investigators had got "some breaks," but he would not say whether they had recovered any weapons or what had led them to the suspects.
5683	 1985	a	Fear that a world war will break out in the next decade is dramatically declining in Western Europe, according to a recent public-opinion poll conducted for the European Commission, the Common Market's executive body. A similar trend has been found in the United States.Only 13 percent of the West Europeans polled, down from 34 percent in 1980, indicated they felt a world war was probable within 10 years, according to a consortium of European polling companies headed by Jacques-Rene Rabier, special counselor to the European Economic Community.Last fall, from Oct. 2 to Nov. 4, 9,911 people were interviewed in the 10 Common Market countries and were asked to estimate the chances of a war in the next decade on a scale that began at 0 and moved by tens to 100.Two percent indicated that war was certain, by marking the 100 box, and 11 percent chose numbers from 90 down to 60, the level Mr. Rabier and his associates interpret as meaning that a respondent thinks war is probable. Twelve percent picked 50. In 1983, 19 percent gave a rating of 60 or higher.
3097	 2001	a	During fashion week in Paris, the city puts on a festival of style, rather than a trade show like other fashion capitals. Parisians dress up to attend designer collections. It's all part of the Gallic cultural education, which spans the generations -- from youngsters, one here in a feather boa and another in a twin set, to a stylish 99-year-old wearing Issey Miyake, from shoes to hat.Among the crowds during last month's shows were an African actor, second from left at top, in a leopard-collared Edwardian-style coat; three London fashion students in funky gear, far left at bottom; a Dior client in a popular camouflage outfit, top right; and the artist James Rosenquist, near left, with his arm around his wife, Mimi.A Dior client, above, wore a spring jacket marked with ruching at the waist, which other designers were just exhibiting for next winter.

3353	 2000	a	To the Editor:In his review of Michael A. Bellesiles's ''Arming America'' (Sept. 10), Garry Wills accepts the book's ludicrous argument, which dismisses the use of firearms in America from early times.At first, guns were indeed rare and unreliable. The need, however, was undeniable. You can't kill a deer with a sharp stick, and it's all but impossible to bring down a rabbit with a thrown stone. The early muskets were improved, but not soon. The ''embattled farmers'' who fired ''the shot heard round the world'' were underequipped, but they sure were better shots than the Brits. It took them seven years, underfed, frostbitten and underarmed, but in the end they defeated the finest army in the world. They didn't do it with pocket knives.As for those wise old dead white guys who invented our country, it may well be that the creation of the United States was the most important event since the founding of the Roman Republic. If you accept this, as I assume most Americans would, then follow the trail of revolution: the next was the French Revolution, dissolving almost at once into the bloody Terror, succeeded in turn by the dictatorship of Napoleon, followed in time by the equally bloody dictatorships of Stalin, Mussolini, Hitler (the last two elected democratically), Mao Zedong, Fidel Castro, Pol Pot and Laurent Kabila. The first act of each of these bloody-handed tyrants on taking power was to confiscate all privately held firearms. Perhaps that will give Wills pause.He is correct in saying that the Civil War brought immense improvement in the design and quality of guns (from cannons to pistols). The Confederates tended to be better shots, but the Union troops improved throughout the war, and of course had better weaponry and equipment over all. The Plains Indians were subdued after the war by cavalrymen, even better armed than they'd been in the Civil War.
3993	 1996	a	Two sections of stage seats had to be set up at Alice Tully Hall to accommodate the overflow for Thursday night's recital by Renee Fleming. In the last three years this American soprano has deservedly won an ardent following; she is now central to the artistic future of the Metropolitan Opera. But this means there may be few chances to hear her again in a hall so intimate, which will be unfortunate. Ms. Fleming used it to advantage in this remarkable recital.There were many musical opportunities for Ms. Fleming to unleash the full resources of her voice, for example, the resplendent top notes that capped Strauss's ecstatic "Cacilie" and Turina's sultry Spanish "Besa el aura." Even during her winsome, elegantly restrained performance of Poulenc's "Fiancailles pour rire" songs, her voice had shimmering presence and warmth.But on this night in this hall, it was the range and quality of her soft singing that were especially impressive. She captured the sense of quietude and calm at the core of Schubert's gentle "Du bist die Ruh." And the sustained, soft lines in his "Nacht und Traume" were rendered with affecting repose.The only slight flaws in Ms. Fleming's singing were some occasional intonation problems, and these always seemed a result of attempts to create a particular nuance or shading. Ms. Fleming's artistry is deeply expressive without being mannered.

2213	 2006	a	HONOLULU, March 31 — Heavy rains and a giant sewage spill near Waikiki Beach left residents here beating back floodwaters on Friday and tourists playing board games and watching movies in their hotels.Several hundred yards of beaches in Honolulu from Ala Moana Park to the military's Hale Koa Hotel in Waikiki were closed to swimmers for a second day because of high bacteria levels, and the rain refused to let up. Five of Oahu's six public golf courses, the Honolulu Zoo and a popular botanical garden were also closed because of flooding.It has been more than 50 years since Hawaii has had a drenching like the current one. Friday was the 41st day of rain in the Hawaiian Islands and ended one of the wettest Marches on record. The rain began Feb. 19 and has brought with it flash floods, landslides, mudslides and a dam break on Kauai that killed seven people, four of whom are still missing."It's really kind of a once-in-a-lifetime situation," said Jim Weyman, a meteorologist in charge of the National Weather Service office in Honolulu, who attributed the rain to a deep upper-level trough of low pressure just west of the islands. "It makes the air over the Hawaiian Islands unstable."PhotoA sewer line on the back side of Waikiki broke March 24, and the city had to divert the wastewater to the Ala Wai canal until Wednesday, some 48 million gallons over the five and a half days, instead of allowing it to back up into homes, hotels and businesses, said Bill Brennan, a spokesman for the City of Honolulu. The canal leads to the ocean near Waikiki Beach.Advertisement Continue reading the main story"If wastewater backed up into those areas, it would have been catastrophic and certainly devastating," Mayor Mufi Hannemann told reporters at a news conference on Thursday.

11171	 1943	a	A NEW broom sweeps clean, they say, and such new brooms as Owner Bill Cox and Manager Bucky Harris certainly have plenty to sweep in their efforts to whisk the Phils into the pennant. They need a lot more at Philadelphia besides the franchise, Danny Litwhiler and good intentions. Baseball no longer is run from the top down as it was in the days of John McGraw.

2441	 2005	a	TOO LATE -- Today is the day General Motors ends its employee-discount promotion, so if you want to get a reduction from the sticker price, starting tomorrow you'll have to go back to old-fashioned haggling. It seems like the program was a smashing success: G.M. sales surged 42 percent in the first 15 days of July from a year earlier, and Ford and DaimlerChrysler, which joined the price-cutting fray, also enjoyed big rebounds. Look for record or near-record figures when vehicle sales are announced this week. (Tomorrow.)OPEN WALLETS -- The big question is how wide consumers are opening them in places like Wal-Mart and Macy's. Everything else seems to be up these days -- car sales, stocks (the Nasdaq hit a four-year high last Thursday), real estate (aside from ever-surging prices, sales of existing homes hit a record annual rate in June), industrial output, business spending -- so why not store sales? Come on, shoppers, do your duty. (Thursday).BACK TO THE 4'S? -- Well, not everything's going up. The unemployment rate has fallen to 5 percent from its post-9/11 peak of 6.3 percent, and this week we'll find out whether the happy trend continued in June. Was Friday's announcement that the economy expanded at an annualized rate of 3.4 percent in the second quarter a good omen? It was a shade below economists' expectations of 3.5 percent growth, but it might be enough to do the trick and certainly will do nothing to throw Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan off course of continuing to raise interest rates. (Friday)TOP SECRET -- This week, the World Trade Organization is scheduled to produce a ruling -- planned to be a confidential one -- on the European Union's restrictions on genetically modified crops. European environmentalists and much of the European public support the bans, but industry says it violates fair-trade rules. It is just one of several trade disputes between the United States and Europe, including American protests over government subsidies to Airbus. (Friday)
3940	 1996	a	To the Editor:Re "Invite In the Rich? PEN Is Pondering" (Arts pages, Jan. 24): The measures being considered are more to attract expertise than money. Like many not-for-profits, we face a tightening budget. We retain foundation support and long-term support from the publishing industry.Our concern is to strengthen our programs promoting freedom of the written word, literacy and literature. Hence the proposals to introduce nonmembers onto our board; they would bring breadth of experience, both financial and professional, and would be a resource for expanding our financial base.You portray a board deeply divided. A preliminary poll on the proposed changes indicated that 80 percent of board members favor them. We are confident we have the imagination and experience to surmount our fiscal difficulties and to bring our work forward.PAMELA MCCORDUCK Vice Pres., PEN American Center New York, Jan. 29, 1996

4530	 1993	a	The percentage of competitive bids have averaged only 20 percent of the total in 1991, 1992 and the first three quarters of this year. And the percentage has been declining, from 23.9 percent in 1991 to 18.6 percent for the first nine months of this year. In the third quarter, the percentage of competitive bids was down to 18.3 percent.But the costs of being first in the rankings is something Merrill might be thinking about after the California bid. While a rally in the market could turn the numbers upside down and make Merrill's original aggressive bid look good, as of yesterday it had not.The 30-year bonds that were priced to yield 5.24 percent at the sale on Tuesday were trading at around 5.35 percent yesterday in the secondary market, according to several traders. Bonds with maturities of 16 years and less that had not yet been sold were being offered at yields 20 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over their original yields. This means a sharp drop in prices, which move in the opposite direction."They came too high," said a member of the syndicate that Merrill Lynch led. In market jargon, "high" means the bid, made in interest rates, was too low.This member of the syndicate suggested that winning has become too important for some of the big firms. "They are so intent on winning that they bid it too aggressively," he said, speaking on the condition that he not be named. "It looks like the account," he added, referring to all the firms in the syndicate, "is going to lose a lot of money unless the market turns around." Treasury MarketThe Treasury market went through another volatile day of trading yesterday, as it got a dose of economic data that was a little more optimistic than some investors liked.Since one of the foundations of the recent rally has been sluggish economic growth that can neutralize any inflation worries, signs of even a modest pickup can be disturbing when interest rates are already so low.

Purpose of Transaction.Item 4 is hereby supplemented by adding the following text to the information previously set forth in Amendment No. 6 to this Schedule 13D.On May 1, 2012, Highfields Capital I LP delivered various materials to the Issuers Corporate Secretary, Stergios Theologides, notifying that the Reporting Persons intend to nominate Barry Baker, Glenn Christenson and Farhad Nanji for election to the board of directors of the Issuer at the 2012 annual meeting of stockholders. In addition, on behalf of the Reporting Persons on May 1, 2012, a letter was sent to the Issuer’s Chairman of the Board, in part, setting forth the biographies of the proposed nominees, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B and incorporated herein by reference.SECURITY HOLDERS ARE ADVISED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT AND OTHER DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE SOLICITATION OF PROXIES BY HIGHFIELDS CAPITAL I LP, HIGHFIELDS CAPITAL II LP, HIGHFIELDS CAPITAL III L.P., HIGHFIELDS CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LP, HIGHFIELDS ASSOCIATES LLC, HIGHFIELDS GP LLC, JONATHON S. JACOBSON, BARRY BAKER, GLENN CHRISTENSON, FARHAD NANJI AND CERTAIN OF THEIR AFFILIATES FROM THE STOCKHOLDERS OF CORELOGIC, INC. FOR USE AT ITS 2012 ANNUAL MEETING WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION, INCLUDING INFORMATION RELATING TO THE PARTICIPANTS IN SUCH PROXY SOLICITATION. WHEN COMPLETED, A DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT AND A FORM OF PROXY WILL BE MAILED TO STOCKHOLDERS OF CORELOGIC, INC. AND WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE AT NO CHARGE AT THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION'S WEBSITE AT HTTP://WWW.SEC.GOV.Item 6. Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer.Item 6 is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:Except as otherwise set forth in this Schedule 13D, none of the Reporting Persons has any contract, arrangement, understanding or relationship (legal or otherwise) with any person with respect to any securities of the Issuer, including, but not limited to, any contract, arrangement, understanding or relationship concerning the transfer or voting of any securities of the Issuer, finders fees, joint ventures, loan or option arrangements, puts or calls, guaranties of profits, division of profits or loss or the giving or withholding of proxies.The Funds have signed letter agreements, pursuant to which each Fund has agreed to indemnify each of Messrs. Christenson, Nanji and Baker against claims arising from solicitation of proxies from the Issuer’s stockholders in connection with the annual meeting and any related transactions. A form of the letter agreements is attached hereto as Exhibit C and incorporated by reference.Each of the Funds holds a portion of its assets, which may include the Issuers securities, in prime brokerage accounts at various institutions, which accounts provide the Funds with access to margin or other financing. The customer and related agreements governing such accounts generally provide the broker counterparty with security, collateral or similar rights of possession, sale or offset with respect to such account assets in the event of a customer default. Such agreements generally also provide the counterparty with rights to lend assets held in such account, in some cases without advance or other notification to the customer. To the extent the Issuers securities owned by the Funds are held from time to time in such prime broker accounts they may be subject to such counterparty rights.Each of the Funds has entered into cash-settled swap transactions with counterparties, the terms of which are designed to produce economic benefits and risks that correspond substantially to those of owning shares of common stock of the Issuer but do not give the Fund any direct or indirect voting, investment or dispositive rights or powers over any shares of common stock of the Issuer and do not require the counterparty thereto to acquire, hold, vote or dispose of any securities of the Issuer (each, a Swap Transaction and collectively, the Swap Transactions). The Swap Transactions provide that during their term the Funds will receive from the counterparties one or more cash payments equal to the positive market price performance, if any, of the referenced number of shares of common stock of the Issuer as well as any dividends that would be received by a holder of such shares (253,777 shares in the case of Highfields Capital I LP, 1,147,744 shares in the case of Highfields Capital II LP and 2,164,017 shares in the case of Highfields Capital III L.P.), and that the Funds will make one or more cash payments to the counterparties equal to the negative market price performance of such shares, if any, plus specified financing costs. Each Fund disclaims any beneficial ownership of any shares of common stock of the Issuer that may be referenced in such Swap Transactions and any shares of common stock of the Issuer or other securities or financial instruments that may be held or transacted in from time to time by any counterparty to such Swap Transactions.The Swap Transactions described above do not, and will not at any time, give the Reporting Persons voting or investment power over any Issuer securities referenced therein. Accordingly, the Reporting Persons disclaim beneficial ownership in any Issuer securities that may be referenced in such contracts or that may be held from time to time by any counterparties to such contracts.Item 7.

Van Skilling Chairman of the Board Corelogic Inc. 4 First American Way Santa Ana, CA 92707-5913Dear Van:As you know, weve provided Spencer Stuart with several names of highly experienced and qualified business leaders who would be exceptional CoreLogic directors. Our understanding is that Spencer Stuart is in contact with these and other potential candidates but that the process will continue for some weeks to come.It is our hope that the availability of numerous high quality candidates leads you to make the meaningful Board changes that are necessary to achieve the company's full potential. However, without assurance that this will be the case, and given todays deadline for shareholder nominations, we have submitted documents to the Companys corporate secretary to preserve our rights and formally nominate three individuals for election to CoreLogics Board of Directors.For your convenience, biographical information about the three nominees--Barry Baker, Glenn Christenson and Farhad Nanji-- is attached to this letter. These individuals, as well as the other persons we suggested to Spencer Stuart, all have the requisite independence, knowledge and judgment necessary to help the Company identify and execute on its opportunities.Our preference is that these nominations, and a contested election of directors, prove unnecessary and that the Board takes the initiative and does more than simply add two directors to the current Board make-up. Such a step would benefit the Company, its shareholders and its employees.Sincerely, /s/ Joseph F. Mazzella Joseph F. Mazzella Managing Director and General Counsel cc: Board of DirectorsBarry Baker, 59, is currently a Managing Director and a Member of the Investment Committee of BV Investment Partners, a private equity firm with significant investments in business and information services. Mr. Baker joined BV Investment Partners in 2000 and devotes substantial time to developing and instituting sales and operational changes in its portfolio companies, which include Camp Systems, Production Resource Group and Vue Entertainment.

In such position, he was responsible for business units that included broadcast and cable television, on-line shopping and other information and distribution operations including Hotels.com, Ticketmaster and CitySearch.In 1989, Mr. Baker founded River City Broadcasting, L.P. and served as its Chief Executive Officer through 1996.

Mr. Baker then headed Sinclair’s operations until 1999.Mr. Baker attended Syracuse University and serves on the Newhouse School of Public Communications Board. He serves on the Intermountain Health Board of Trustees.We believe that his more than 36 years of industry and operating experience, and his deep knowledge of information service and distribution businesses well qualifies him to serve on the Board.Glenn Christenson, 62, has been Managing Director of Velstand Investments, LLC since 2007.

Indemnification.(a) In the event the Indemnitee in his capacity as a nominee for election to the Board at the Annual Meeting was, is or becomes a party to or other participant in, or is threatened to be made a party to or other participant in, a Claim by reason of (or arising or allegedly arising in any manner out of or relating to in whole or in part) an Indemnifiable Event, the Indemnitors, jointly and severally (subject to the last sentence of this Section 2(a)), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnitee from and against any and all Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by the Indemnitee or to which the Indemnitee becomes subject, resulting from, arising out of or relating to such Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnitee shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement for Claims arising from the Indemnitees gross negligence, willful misconduct, intentional material violations of law, criminal actions, material breach of the terms of this Agreement, or for which payment is prohibited by applicable law; provided further, that the indemnification and other obligations hereunder shall terminate upon the Indemnitee becoming a director of the Company. The parties agree that in the first instance, the forgoing indemnification obligation of the Indemnitors will be pro rata based on each Indemnitors respective direct ownership of shares of common stock of the Company; provided, that if one or more of the Indemnitors fails to so indemnify, the other Indemnitors will satisfy such indemnification obligation on a joint and several basis and have the right to reimbursement from any such defaulting Indemnitor.(b) In the case of the commencement of any action against the Indemnitee in respect of which he may seek indemnification from the Indemnitors hereunder, the Indemnitors may, by written notice to the Indemnitee, elect to assume the defense thereof (with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee), including, without limitation, the negotiation and approval of any settlement of such action. After notice from the Indemnitors to the Indemnitee of the Indemnitors election so to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnitors will not be liable to the Indemnitee under this Agreement for any Expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation and preparation therefor (including, without limitation, appearing as a witness and reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel in connection therewith). If, in any action for which indemnity may be sought hereunder, the Indemnitors shall not have timely assumed the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, or the Indemnitee shall have been advised by his counsel that it would constitute a conflict of interest for the same counsel to represent both him and the Indemnitors or both him and any other Indemnitee in such action, or if the Indemnitee may have separate or additional defenses with regard to such action, the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his own counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitors in such action, in which event the Indemnitors shall reimburse the Indemnitee for all reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred by him in connection with the defense thereof. The Indemnitors shall in no event be liable for any settlement of any action effected without each of their prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). The Indemnitors shall not settle any Claim in any manner that would impose any expense, penalty, obligation or liability on the Indemnitee, or would contain language (other than a recitation of any amounts to be paid in settlement) that could reasonably be viewed as an acknowledgment of wrongdoing on the part of the Indemnitee or as materially detrimental to the reputation of the Indemnitee, without the Indemnitees prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).(c) The Indemnitees right to indemnification pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement shall include the right of the Indemnitee to be advanced by the Indemnitors any Expenses incurred in connection with any Indemnifiable Event as soon as practicable after such Expenses are incurred by the Indemnitee and in any event within 30 days after the receipt by the Indemnitors of a statement or statements from the Indemnitee documenting such Expenses in reasonable detail and requesting such advances from time to time; provided, however, that all amounts advanced in respect of such Expenses shall be promptly repaid to the Indemnitors by the Indemnitee if it shall ultimately be determined in a final judgment that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for such Expenses.(d) The Indemnitee shall give the Indemnitors written notice of any Claim (accompanied by supporting documentation in reasonable detail) as soon as practicable after the Indemnitee becomes aware thereof; provided, however, that the failure of the Indemnitee to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnitors of their indemnification obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that such failure materially prejudices the rights of the Indemnitors.3. Partial Indemnity, Etc. If the Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Indemnitors for some or a portion of any Loss, but not for all of the total amount thereof, the Indemnitors shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which the Indemnitee is entitled. Moreover, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, to the extent that the Indemnitee has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any or all Claims relating in whole or in part to an Indemnifiable Event or in defense of any issue or matter therein, including dismissal without prejudice, the Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Expenses incurred in connection therewith pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.4. Amendments, Etc. No supplement, modification or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding with respect to any party unless executed in writing by such party. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar) nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.5. Subrogation. In the event of payment under this Agreement, the Indemnitors shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the applicable Indemnitee, and that Indemnitee shall, at the Indemnitors expense, execute all papers reasonably required and shall do everything that may be reasonably necessary to secure such rights, including the execution of such documents reasonably necessary to enable the Indemnitors effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.6. No Duplication of Payments. The Indemnitors shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment in connection with a Claim made against the Indemnitee to the extent the Indemnitee otherwise is entitled to receive payment (under any insurance policy, certificate of incorporation, by-law or otherwise) of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if the Indemnitors have made payments to the Indemnitee pursuant to the indemnification and expense reimbursement provisions hereof and the Indemnitee subsequently is reimbursed by a third party therefore, the Indemnitee shall remit such subsequent reimbursement to the Indemnitors.7. Confidentiality.(a) The Indemnitee hereby agrees to keep confidential and not disclose to any party, without the consent of the Indemnitors, any confidential, proprietary or non-public information (collectively, Information) of the Indemnitors, their respective affiliates or members of its Schedule 13D group which the Indemnitee has heretofore obtained or may obtain in connection with the Indemnitees service as a nominee hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Information shall not include any information that is publicly disclosed by the Indemnitors, their respective affiliates or members of its Schedule 13D group or any information that the Indemnitee can demonstrate is now, or hereafter becomes, through no act or failure to act on the Indemnitees part, otherwise generally known to the public.(b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 7(a) to the contrary, if the Indemnitee is required by applicable law, rule, regulation or legal process to disclose any Information, the Indemnitee may do so provided that the Indemnitee first promptly notifies the Indemnitors so that the Indemnitors may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or, in the Indemnitors sole discretion, waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event that no such protective order or other remedy is obtained or the Indemnitors do not waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement, the Indemnitee may furnish only that portion of the Information which the Indemnitee is advised by counsel is legally required to be so disclosed and the Indemnitee will request that the parties receiving such Information maintain it as confidential.(c) All Information, all copies thereof, and any studies, notes, records, analysis, compilations or other documents prepared by the Indemnitee containing such Information, shall be and remain the property of the Indemnitors and, upon the request of a representative of the Indemnitors, all such information shall be returned or, at the Indemnitors option, destroyed by the Indemnitee, with such destruction confirmed by the Indemnitee to the Indemnitors in writing.8. Expenses. The Indemnitors agree to reimburse the Indemnitee for the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnitee incurred in connection with the review of this Agreement or otherwise in connection with the Indemnitees being a nomine.9. Governing Law. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its principles of conflict of laws, and by the applicable laws of the United States.10. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but which together shall constitute one agreement.11. Notices.

2143	 2007	a	Just over two weeks ago, the Devils’ season appeared to be unraveling.After losing at home to the Islanders, 1-0, on Nov. 16, the Devils were in the Atlantic Division basement with a 7-10-2 record. They had scored only 42 goals in their first 19 games — an average of 2.2 a game — and had lost three straight games as Martin Brodeur was attempting to notch his 500th career victory. (Listen as Marty discusses his milestone here.)I had watched the Rangers defeat the Devils at the new arena in Newark on Nov. 14 in a way I had never seen — with patience and opportunistic scoring, formerly a Devils trademark! With Scott Gomez and Brian Rafalski lost to free agency, and with Brodeur another year older and possibly a little slower, it was getting easy to believe that the Devils were a team in decline and looking at a season that was only going to get worse.So what happened? After shutting out the Canadiens, 4-0, Friday, the Devils had won their sixth game in a row and were only four points out of first place in the division!While six games does not make a season, it is clear that this team cannot be counted out. Brodeur has been in net for all six games, allowing only seven goals and recording two shutouts. Zach Parise (7 goals, 6 assists) and Brian Gionta (5 goals, 5 assists), along with Jamie Langenbrunner (9 assists) have given a huge lift to an offense that has scored 22 goals during the six-game streak.Were you one of the ones ready to count out the Devils? Do you think they will continue to improve as the season goes on? Will they win another division title?

5542	 1986	a	''My final comment on these cases is that each player I met maintains he is not currently using any drugs,'' Ueberroth said yesterday. ''I have no reason to doubt this. It is, however, an established fact that the recovery rate for drug abusers is low.''For this reason, career testing is imperative. Even with testing, recurrence is possible, but testing is simply the best device we have to deter further use or detect a new problem.''The players, their agents and their association may well try some legal action against the sentence. But Ueberroth cut one major objection off at the pass by putting testing in the hands of a confidential agency hired by the commissioner's office. No longer can the players raise the specter of an owner rampaging through the clubhouse, handing out bottles after a tough loss.Mandatory universal testing? That's another issue. The Pittsburgh 11 and their 10 colleagues had no leeway. Various testimony, including their own, linked them to drug usage - and facilitating others, in the case of seven - and none of them convinced Ueberroth in private interviews that it must have been some other guy. The fact is, these 21 players may have been on the road to becoming the next Micheal Ray Richardson, banned from basketball earlier this week after flunking his third chance. Drug addiction is much worse than illegal; it is life-threatening.The players knew they would not get away without a penalty. One of the Pittsburgh 11 said this winter that he knew he would be fined and tested; he never mentioned community service, which is the sleeper in Ueberroth's decision.

2456	 2005	a	According to David Weinstein, president of the Chicagoland Entrepreneurial Center, a nonprofit group aimed at helping emerging entrepreneurs, Mr. Avakian is an example of the successful "lifestyle" entrepreneur. As opposed to the high-growth entrepreneurs like Jeff Bezos of Amazon, he says, lifestyle entrepreneurs are content to stay small, focused and profitable rather than rushing forward seeking growth regardless of the inevitable red ink and risky financing."Lifestyle types are driven, not by mega-growth, but by quality of service and by providing a meaningful service or product to a community," Mr. Weinstein said.Though Mr. Avakian has his sights set on a significant national campaign someday, Mr. Weinstein, who has advised Argot Tea, is impressed by the discipline Mr. Avakian has demonstrated with his start-up. "They are growing within their community, getting established within each community and not trying to launch 100 stores at once," he said.They are also tapping into a deepening well of discontent with the big chain stores, with their crowded aisles, impersonal service and, in the case of Wal-Mart, a perception that workers are not well treated. "I hate malls and I hate Wal-Mart," said Upton Bell, a radio and television commentator in Cambridge, Mass., who prefers to shop at local family-run stores like Cambridge Naturals, a natural-products and supplements outlet. "Each day, it seems that we have less and less control of our lives, so it's important to me to have a place where everybody knows my name and I know I'm not being conned."Perhaps he is being a bit harsh on the chains. After all, they provide the little guys with a steady stream of dissatisfied customers. And they are not necessarily the predators they are made out to be. Rather than decimate the independent coffee shops in Main Street America, for example, the popularity of Starbucks apparently swelled their ranks. According to the Specialty Coffee Association of America, as the Starbucks chain grew from 55 outlets in 1989 to 8,500 last year, the number of independent coffee shops in the United States increased to 10,000 from 521."It was Starbucks that raised the awareness and interest," said Paul Comi, president of Caffe d'Amore in Pasedena, Calif., a $22 million supplier to independent coffee shops.For Michael Kanter and Elizabeth Stagl, who are married and co-owners of Cambridge Naturals, staying small is a choice they have made for the 31 years they have operated in Cambridge. Though there have been numerous chances to open additional stores in the Boston area, the couple has stayed put in their Massachusetts Avenue location, just north of Harvard Square. During that time, they have seen dozens of competitors in the area come and go. Today, there are three Whole Foods supermarkets within two miles of the store, along with a Wild Oats and a Harvest Co-op within three miles. In Harvard Square, just six blocks away, are two more competitors of similar size. Yet Cambridge Naturals thrives and turns a comfortable profit for its owners."We live in an isolated and lonely culture," Mr. Kanter said. "When you ask people what is missing from their lives, it isn't a big-box store. People stop into our store for the social interaction as well as the products. We're an oasis."

486	 2016	a	Dear Diary:Recent news coverage regarding a documentary about the film director Brian De Palma reminded me of the day in 1970 when he and Robert De Niro came to our I.M. Pei faculty/grad student building at New York University on Bleecker Street (now called Silver Towers).The film, called “Hi, Mom,” continued the story of the antihero in “Greetings,” who was now a peeping Tom. My apartment was the object of his obsession, since it was opposite their other site on Greene Street.Mr. De Niro was handsome and polite and smiled at our 6-month-old. Mr. De Palma shrugged around our place checking camera angles. I think we got $100 and moved out for 24 hours.When we came back, they were still working on a scene with the actress Jennifer Salt, who was in a flimsy robe and getting ready to reshoot a nude scene in our bathtub. She was apologizing/explaining to my young wife about how acting and real life were not necessarily the same.

952	 2013	a	Colgate University is mounting an exhibition of sound-art installations by Chinese artists whose work has never been displayed in the United States.Sound artists use noise, live performances by musicians, recorded ambient sounds, spoken words, audio-visual tapes and other aural elements to create art installations that either have no visual elements or forge a connection between images and sounds. It has become a popular genre in China in recent years, where a new generation of avant-garde artists are pushing its boundaries.The Colgate exhibition, “Revolution Per Minute,” will feature works by more than 30 Chinese artists who work with sound, including Wang Changcun, Yan Jun, Samson Young and members of the Shanghai noise band Torturing Nurse.“This really reflects the landscape and soundscape of China, and it’s much more diverse, much more progressive, than we imagine it could be,” said Wenhua Shi, an assistant professor of art who is organizing the show along with the American-trained sound artist Dajuin Yao. The exhibition will run from March 26 through April 26 and feature 35 installations scattered throughout the Colgate campus and nearly village of Hamilton, N.Y.Among the works will be two pieces by Mr. Young: “I am thinking in a room, different from the one you are hearing in now,” a performance piece that uses the performers’ brain waves to control a sound-making device (a homage to the sound art pioneer Alvin Lucier and his brain-wave pieces), and “Liquid Border,” which uses ambient noises from fences along the border between Hong Kong and mainland China.Some of the other pieces touch on sensitive political and social issues, though none have been banned in China, Mr. Shi said. For instance, Edwin Lo’s “Mourn” from 2011 is a spooky audio-visual work about candlelight vigils to commemorate the killings at Tiananmen Square in 1989. Another piece, by Xu Cheng, makes use recordings of people engaging in telephone sex and arranging casual trysts on a chat line, a subject considered provocative by Chinese standards, Mr. Shi said.
201	 2018	a	Under the Obama administration, the federal education department offered guidance to universities conducting Title IX investigations of sexual misconduct that they should use a “preponderance of evidence” standard. Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, revoked that guidance, but universities still use a lower standard than the criminal courts.“Universities like Yale are free to apply any standard within reason,” said Geoffrey Stone, a law professor at the University of Chicago Law School. “Also, the fact that someone is acquitted of a criminal offense does not mean they can’t be held responsible in another context.”But Andrew T. Miltenberg, an attorney with Nesenoff & Miltenberg LLP in New York City who has represented many students accused of sexual assault, said the low legal standards and the lack of safeguards of these committees make it nearly impossible for anyone to get a fair and reasonable hearing. Mr. Miltenberg is not representing Mr. Khan.“I think we would all like to believe that he could and will get an unbiased and uncompromised hearing by Yale, but I think it is virtually impossible,” he said.At the same time, an online petition against Mr. Khan’s being reinstated had drawn more than 77,000 signatures by Thursday.

3431	 1999	a	Maggert had a chance to end the match at No. 18, but his 15-foot putt for birdie slid past the hole, as the crowd moaned, while Maggert stared at the ball and the cup in disbelief. But two holes later Maggert ended the match at No. 11, after hitting an 8-iron for his tee shot that landed near the green in the left rough.''I had the kind of chip where I could make it,'' Maggert said. ''It was uphill, had a little left-to-right break. The last thing I wanted to do was run it four or five feet by, but I hit it a little bit too hard. Even when I saw it hit the hole, I thought it was going to pop out. And it went in.''There were many shifts in momentum throughout the match, which started with 18 holes in the morning, followed by 18 more holes and then the two extra holes in the afternoon. Magee was 3 up through eight holes in the morning, and he started the afternoon play still leading, 2 up. But as he did throughout the tournament, Maggert remained steady and confident, despite struggling with putts from 5 to 10 feet, and he slowly whittled away at his early deficit.''If it was a nine-hole tournament I might have won, but I had 27 more to play,'' Magee said. Asked if he thought about the prize money, Magee laughed and said: ''I thought about the money all day. I knew what was at stake.''But Maggert walked away with the top prize, moving to the top of the tour's money list this year. And the victory will elevate Maggert's recognition factor with the public. His peers have long recognized Maggert as a solid player, but with six victories this week, including the defeats of top-seeded Tiger Woods, and Nick Price and Bernhard Langer, Maggert rose to the occasion and won the first event of the new World Golf Championships series.Maggert came close to winning the United States Open in 1997, before faltering on the back nine and finishing fourth. Perhaps with this victory, the 35-year-old Maggert will become even more confident during a tournament's crucial moments.''I knew inside that I had what it took to win tournaments,'' Maggert said. ''Guys that can play well when they are nervous are guys that win tournaments. You can't be afraid of it. Everyone chokes in golf. That is just a fact of life. I have choked before. Sometimes I don't choke. But being nervous is part of the game. I was nervous, but I was confident.''And today, having refused to let another tournament slip away, Maggert was a winner. ''It was a long week, probably the biggest win of my career,'' he said. ''You've got the top 64 guys playing and match play is a very difficult format. The biggest thing is, I can just be myself now. If I finish second now, it's O.K. Now I can go out and have fun.''

3195	 2001	a	In ''Mysterious Object at Noon,'' the director Apichatpong Weerasethakul has devised a distinct kind of entertainment. Early on in this hybrid documentary, made in Thailand, a young woman who is not an actress relates a horrible incident. Her father, short of money to get home from a trip, sold her to her uncle. As she gets through the story, questioning her own worth, the off-camera director asks her a peculiar question: ''Now, do you have any other stories to tell us? It can be real or fiction.''She wipes tears from her cheeks and mutters, ''What else can I tell you, real or fake?'' Is the filmmaker trying to distract her from her horrible tale, or does he have something wholly different in mind?Whatever his agenda, Mr. Weerasethakul's odd request leads him across Thailand, where a cross section of people pick up the new story the girl invents and add their own details. The movie is like a combination of the gossip game and the old fable ''Stone Soup,'' in which suspicious villagers toss contributions into the pot of a wanderer to make a stew unlike any other; the wanderer's intent is to bring them all together. And that's the best way to describe what ''Mysterious Object'' will do for audiences. It's a film unlike any other, complete with a title that sounds like a remark that would result from a U.F.O. sighting.The picture, which begins a run today at Anthology Film Archives, is shot in grainy black-and-white that sometimes seems to have pixels the size of pocket change. ''Mysterious Object,'' which is in Thai with English subtitles, is similar to the exercise in which assorted writers each contribute a sentence, or sometimes a chapter, to build a single story. By traveling through Thailand's countryside to encourage townspeople to spin the narrative, the film offers a beguiling look into the country.

4232	 1995	a	Ian Miller, the president and chief operating officer of Tatham Euro RSCG in Chicago, and one of three managing partners, has resigned from the agency after five years, effective immediately."Ian did not see eye to eye with Euro RSCG about his role in the organization," Ralph Rydholm, chairman and chief executive of Tatham, said yesterday, referring to the agency's parent in Paris.Ian is a good guy with a ton of good background," he added, but Mr. Miller "would have preferred to move up at Tatham, and that was not going to be the case in the near future." Mr. Miller, 45, could not be reached for comment; Mr. Rydholm said Mr. Miller was traveling in Australia.The trade publication Adweek reported on Oct. 16 that relations between Mr. Miller and executives of Euro RSCG had been strained. The Chicago Tribune reported on Monday that Mr. Miller and Euro RSCG had hired lawyers to try to settle an unspecified dispute.

2892	 2002	a	Shares in StorageNetworks, a three-year-old data-storage company based in Waltham, Mass., jumped over 25 percent yesterday after it reported a fourth-quarter loss that was narrower than analysts had forecast and announced a deal with Electronic Data Systems, the big computer services company. Excluding $114.4 million in costs associated with retrieving equipment from bankrupt companies like Exodus Communications Inc., Storage Networks said its loss would have been 19 cents a share. Analysts expected the company to lose 25 cents on that basis. Sales rose 49 percent from a year earlier, to $31.6 million. Its shares rose $1.06, to $5.14. Shares in StorageNetworks ended the day at $5.14, up $1.06. Andrew Zipern (NYT)
5356	 1988	a	Forty-five years ago, when he was 15 years old, Byron Janis made his first impression on the musical world, playing Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto with the NBC Symphony. Five years later, by then a protege of Vladimir Horowitz, the young pianist made his recital debut at Carnegie Hall and embarked on a career that has been a long roller-coaster ride of exhilarating ups and sickening downs. The recital he gave at Alice Tully Hall on Tuesday evening, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Carnegie event, must rank as one of the decided ups.Mr. Janis retired from public performance in the 1960's owing to illness, but returned to the stage in 1972. A year later, he was stricken with arthritis, which affected his wrists and left his fingers fingers swollen and painful. For years he played concerts and recitals under that physical handicap, often receiving blunt treatment from reviewers. Since 1985, when his ailment was diagnosed as psoriatic arthritis, his career has been on the rise once again, evidently thanks to new medical treatment. Two months ago he returned to Moscow for a concert, reprising a celebrated 1960 tour. In recent years, he has been especially active in fund-raising events for the Arthritis Foundation.Remarkably often in his all-Chopin program, Mr. Janis reminded this listener forcibly of the dazzingly facile and arrestingly individual young pianist he first heard more than 30 years ago. Technically the 60-year-old musician may be a bit the worse for his experiences, but he is no invalid. Still spectrally thin if not quite so quiveringly intense as in the dim past, he tended to play as in the past, in brilliant lunges and bursts, relaxing only as if to build up energy for the next attack. The Valse Brillante in A-flat (Op. 34, No. 1) was, typically, deeply inward at one moment, a fireworks display the next. To those who believe there is only one way to play Chopin, in great arches and unbroken lines, such fluctuations might seem intolerably eccentric. In fact, they represented that current rarity, a mature artist's personality mirrored in an infinitely various masterpiece.In the Sonata in B minor (Op. 58), the headlong tempo of the Presto finale pushed the pianist's fingers to the limit, and sometimes beyond. But on the whole, this was fluent Chopin playing with its own appeal. Mr. Janis, as in his youth, did not spin out long Bellini-like phrases but played out Chopin's dramas in taut scenes, as if in search of the opera itself, not merely the arias. Three Mazurkas were approached in the characteristic Janis style: full of rhythmic quirks, precipitous tempo shifts and febrile tension. The idiom's dance origins were obscured in favor of something darker and phantasmorgic, comparable to Ravel's evocative distortions in ''La Valse.''
1929	 2008	a	Senator John McCain raised $47 million in August, more than double his previous best fund-raising month, driven in large part by $10 million in contributions that have come in since he named Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin his running mate on Friday, campaign officials said.The Republican National Committee, which can also spend money on behalf of the McCain-Palin campaign, collected another $22 million, slightly less than what it raised in July, officials said.By way of comparison, the McCain campaign raised just $27 million in July, its best previous month.The August total for the campaign, however, comes close to the $51 million Senator Barack Obama raised in July.After the Republican national convention close, the McCain-Palin campaign will get an infusion of $84 million from the U.S. Treasury as part of public financing.The campaign will be prohibited from raising any additional money for the general election after it accepts the public financing, but McCain-Palin fund-raisers hope to collect another $100 million over the next two months for the R.N.C. A portion of that can be used in a coordinated manner with the campaign, but the rest can be utilized for independent expenditures.

Shalala, president of Hunter College.* William S. Woodside, chairman of the executive committee of the Primerica Corporation. Plea for 'New Voices'The panel met criticism from Assemblyman Roger L. Green, Democrat of Brooklyn. Mr. Green, a leading black legislator, said he was satisfied with the racial composition of the panel, two blacks, two Hispanic people, one Asian and three whites.But he said the panel should also reflect ''new voices,'' specifically parents of public school children.''I would have to say I am disappointed and concerned that the panel is not reflective of the major constituencies that have a vested interest in the school system,'' said Mr. Green, who is chairman of the Black and Puerto Rican Legislative Caucus. ''By that I mean all parents and black and Hispanic children.'' Black and Hispanic children make up a majority of the school population in the city.The delay in forming the panel and Mr. Green's outspokeness seemed to be a harbinger of the politically delicate nature of the task the board faces as it gets down to the business of studying the qualifications of candidates for Chancellor. #2 Announced Candidates Mr. Wagner, who was in Baltimore yesterday, said during the last month that he had trouble finding people to serve on the panel. Two, Dr. Harold E. Howe, senior lecturer in education at Harvard, and Franklin A. Thomas, president of the Ford Foundation, initially agreed to be on the panel but then declined. Mr. Wagner said Dr. Howe had cited the press of other obligations. Mr. Wagner said Mr. Thomas needed the permission of the foundation board to go ahead.The Board of Education is faced with two announced candidates, both of whom are black and neither of whom engender broad enthusiasm among board members. Dr. Bernard E. Gifford, dean of the Graduate School of Education at the University of California at Berkeley and a former deputy schools chancellor in New York, met, at his request, with two board members during a recent visit to the city.

5612	 1986	a	Lewis Schaffel, the executive vice president and chief operating officer of the Nets, resigned yesterday to join an ownership group attempting to bring a National Basketball Association expansion franchise to Miami. The group is headed by Zev Bufman, a theatrical producer, and Billy Cunningham, the former Philadelphia 76er star and coach.Miami, which will break ground Monday for a 15,000-seat arena, says it has orders for 4,600 season tickets. Expansion will be on the agenda when the league owners meet Oct. 20-22 in Phoenix. Before joining the Nets, Schaffel, a former player agent, held similar posts with the New Orleans Jazz and the Atlanta Hawks. The Nets divided Schaffel's responsibility into two areas, business and marketing and basketball. Until a replacement is found, Coach Dave Wohl and his assistants, Bob MacKinnon and Gary St. Jean, and Al Menendez, the director of player of personnel, will run the basketball program.

1214	 2012	a	Pia Sundhage is taking her tactics, her teaching and her singing voice home to Sweden.Hours before the United States women’s national team opened its post-Olympic victory tour with an 8-0 thrashing of Costa Rica in Rochester, Sundhage announced that she was stepping down as the team’s coach to pursue a job in her native Sweden.Her new post was cleared up before the sun set: Sweden’s football association announced on its Web site Saturday night that it had hired Sundhage to coach its women’s national team. She will start her new post on Dec. 1, according to the Swedish F.A.“I have long dreamed of becoming Sweden coach and now I am so happy,” she said.Hours earlier, she reflected on the end of her tenure with the United States team.“It was an honor to be able to coach these players for five years, and I learned a tremendous amount from them,” Sundhage said. “I want to thank all the players and all of my assistant coaches for making me better. Before I took this job, I always admired the spirit and character of the U.S. team, but to experience that first-hand on the training field and from the bench as their coach was truly special and something I will treasure for the rest of my life. Although it is time to move on, I’d like to thank U.S. Soccer for this wonderful opportunity and I wish this team and the players all the best in the future.”Her decision to leave was not a complete surprise; Sundhage’s contract was up after this year, and in an interview last year she had expressed interest in returning to Sweden.“After the Olympics we had discussions and early in the process it became clear that Pia was very interested in returning home to Sweden,” U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati said in a statement. “It certainly wasn’t an easy decision for U.S. Soccer or Pia. She deserves a tremendous amount of credit for the amazing success the U.S. Women’s National Team had during the past five years.”Sundhage’s tenure has unquestionably been a successful one, though the United States failed to win the Women’s World Cup with her at the helm. Sundhage has compiled a record of 89-6-10 and won 11 tournament titles, including two Olympic golds. She also helped patch together a team in transition after its disastrous finish at the 2007 World Cup in China, when Hope Solo turned on her backup and her coach after losing her starting role and the American veterans responded by essentially shunning her.Sundhage put that broken team back together and led it to the Olympic gold medal a year later, saw it lose on penalties in the 2011 World Cup final, then won gold again at the London Olympics this summer. For that, she will be remembered as one of the top coaches in the team’s history (granted, six is a small group, but still …).Better than Anson Dorrance and Tony DiCicco, who each won World Cups? That’d be a tough sell, though Sundhage led the team in what one could argue was a much more competitive era. That might have been what U.S. Soccer officials were trying to convey in Saturday’s announcement. This line in particular from the U.S. Soccer news release ought to go over really well with the Hamm-Lilly-Foudy-Chastain crowd (my emphasis):During her five years on the job Sundhage helped the U.S. team continue to evolve its style of play technically and tactically in the increasingly competitive environment of women’s international soccer. Her tenure culminated in two of the team’s best tournaments ever – the 2011 FIFA Women’s World Cup in Germany and the 2012 Olympics — in terms of the quality of play on the field and excitement generated by the matches.It’s almost as if the author got halfway through that sentence and suddenly realized what it was saying.Corner kick: What do you think of Sundhage’s decision to depart?
3944	 1996	a	I.B.M. made another big bet yesterday that its future depends on becoming a supplier of software and services for computer networks, by agreeing to purchase Tivoli Systems Inc. for $743 million.As corporations increasingly cut payrolls, they are trying to enable fewer people to do more work by giving them powerful personal computers on office desktops and linking the machines together. Tivoli is a small but fast-growing specialist in making software for managing these networks of PC's.This new model of computing, called client-server, is intended to cut costs and improve efficiency by allowing the easy sharing of information. The International Business Machines Corporation made a huge acquisition in the network field last year when it bought the Lotus Development Corporation for $3.5 billion.Lotus's Notes software is a leading program that lets workers share documents and files in computer-linked teams. Tivoli makes software that helps keep these complex client-server networks up and running. In client-server technology, individual users, or clients, are "served" over a network by a central machine that acts as a common repository of information and programs.
5916	 1983	a	Multinational VaultHe is perhaps best known these days as the bronzed man in the white underpants on a giant Calvin Klein billboard overlooking Times Square, but back in 1980 Tom Hintnaus was the nation's top-ranked pole-vaulter, a then 22- year-old Californian who cleared 18 feet 4 1/2 inches to win the Olympic trials and assure himself of the No. 1 pole-vaulting position on the United States Olympic team.The boycott of the 1980 Olympics in Moscow kept Hintnaus and other American athletes from fulfilling their dreams of competing. But for Hintnaus, the boycott posed a special problem.Hintnaus, the son of Czechoslovak refugees who spent several years in Brazil before coming to the United States, had been born in Brazil. As the result of his dual citizenship, he had the right to go to the Moscow Olympics as a member of the Brazilian team.But Hintnaus, who had left Brazil when he was 2 years old, put patriotism above vaulting. And while some American athletes with dual citizenships did elect to go to Moscow as a members of their native teams, Hintnaus did not.
4501	 1993	a	Question: How can I track the performance of mutual funds that are not listed by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system?Answer: To qualify for a listing with Nasdaq, which provides fund data for most newspapers and magazines, a fund generally must have either $25 million in assets or 1,000 or more shareholders. Today about 3,100 funds are Nasdaq-listed and 217 are not, according to Morningstar Inc., fund researchers in Chicago.Tracking the performance of nonlisted funds on a daily basis is almost impossible, said John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds, an investing newsletter. Some financial publications, however, publish weekly quotations, and more do so on a quarterly basis.While nonlisted funds tend to be small and relatively new, that's not always the case, said Gerald W. Perritt, editor of the Mutual Fund Letter, in Chicago. He recommends two no-load growth funds that are small but do have solid histories: Crabbe Huson Special (until recently Crabbe Huson Growth), in Portland, Ore., a value fund, and the Fasciano Fund, in Chicago, which owns shares in small companies.
5132	 1989	a	Professor B. Stanley Pons has given up trying to convince critics that he and his colleague Martin Fleischmann may have unlocked fusion, the power of the sun, in a laboratory beaker.But if many physicists have ridiculed the notion of table-top, room-temperature fusion, it has become a boom industry in Utah, where the two chemists enjoy strong support.The University of Utah, where Dr. Pons teaches, has leased a research center and a Utah congressman is preparing a bill to create a national center here. A private group of boosters has been created to help Dr. Pons and Dr. Fleischmann win over non-believers.Dr. Pons said months of stinging criticism have taken their toll, leaving him frustrated and weary of meetings with skeptical and sometimes hostile colleagues.

7498	 1964	a	The San Diego Chargers, subpar physically for five weeks, have become something less than the awesome defending champions of the American Football League.A succession of injuries to such key performers as Lance Alworth, Paul Lowe, Ron Mix, Keith Lincoln and Dick Harris has brought the West Coast juggernaut to a standstill. After three league games, the Chargers show a record of one victory and two defeats.However, unfortunately for the New York Jets, most of the Chargers are expected to be in excellent health when the clubs clash in Shea Stadium Saturday night.That was the message delivered by Bob Burdick, San Diego's advance man, at the Jets' weekly luncheon yesterday. Of particular interest to Week Ewbank, the Jets' coach, was Burdick's report on Harris, the defensive back who specializes in harassing receivers.

Her father is a real-estate broker in Tiburon. Her mother, Constance S. Stong, is fiscal coordinator for the Family Service Agency of Marin in San Rafael, Calif.Mr. Cassidy, an associate counsel in the legal department of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, graduated magna cum laude with the class of '78 from Harvard and cum laude from the Harvard Law School. His mother is a guidance counselor with the South Bend Community School Corporation. His father was professor and chairman of the English department at Indiana University at South Bend.
2807	 2003	a	The set presents the concertos chronologically, beginning with No. 2 in B flat (composed first but published second). In the opening exposition Mr. Harnoncourt's penchant for breaking up phrases into clear segments is in full operation. After the orchestra plays the hardy opening statement of the theme, there is an extra breath before the strings answer with the soft, lyrical second phrases. The problem is that that slight pause sounds calculated, as if making a point was as important as shaping the phrase.Mr. Harnoncourt is not afraid to encourage a sense of rough and tumble in the playing when called for. At a turning point in the music, before the piano enters, the full orchestra emits three playfully grim fortissimo blasts of unison C naturals, followed, after a pause, by three echoes in the strings and flutes a half-step higher. But Mr. Harnoncourt overdoes the contrast. As played, the passage reminded me of a point that Virgil Thomson once made in reviewing a hyped-up performance of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Why, he wondered, do musicians assume contrast always involves conflict?When the piano enters Mr. Aimard brings a similar quality of periodicity to his phrasing, but in a more natural way. You are swept along by the energy in his playing, even in soft moments, and by the punchy clarity in his passagework, qualities that surely stem from his long experience with modern music.Still, despite my misgivings about Mr. Harnoncourt, with each listening to these performances (and I've found it hard to stop listening) his conducting has seemed more satisfying. Maybe you just get used to his liberties. Eventually the quality of musical surprise he strives for, the sense that you don't know what will happen next, comes through.During the first movement of the B-flat concerto, when the music takes a curiously reflective turn, Mr. Aimard slows down radically while Mr. Harnoncourt holds the orchestra taut and quietly tense. Suddenly you glimpse in this work steeped in Viennese Classicism the mysticism to come in the Concerto No. 4 in G, which transcends any era.The performance of the G major Concerto has a searching intensity. In the slow movement Mr. Harnoncourt treats the stern, unison statements in the strings like grim pronouncement from a Baroque oratorio, and Mr. Aimard plays the pleading, hushed chordal responses as if the piano were some wayward soul timorously asking, ''Will someone listen to me?'' The final movement, performed with wondrous rhythmic bite by Mr. Aimard and driving energy by all, achieves a dynamic ambiguity: is the music jaunty or hellbent?

2146	 2007	a	SAN ANTONIO — With less than 40 minutes to kickoff of the Big 12 championship game here at the Alamodome between No. 1 Missouri and No. 9 Oklahoma, fans are beginning to slowly trickle to their seats.By winning tonight, the Tigers (11-1, 7-1 Big 12) will clinch a berth in the Bowl Championship Series title game. Their lone loss this season was a 41-31 setback at Oklahoma (10-2, 6-2) in October, a game in which Missouri led in the fourth quarter and had four turnovers.Tonight’s game is expected to draw at least 60,000 fans to this 65,000-seat venue, a Big 12 official said. If activity on the famed Riverwalk is an indication of attendance makeup, the Sooners will seemingly have a 3:2 advantage in fans.Outside the dome, Oklahoma fans were chanting “overrated” to Missouri fans. Missouri students Whitney Bodenstab and Alissa Rasmussen, who drove 13 1/2 hours from Columbia, Mo., to attend tonight’s game, hardly seemed bothered by the taunting.“We’ll win because we’re better,” said Bodenstab, 20, a sophomore majoring in communications, advertising and marketing. “We’ve developed a lot more since we played them last time.”Bodenstab and Rasmussen said they had enjoyed their first-ever trip to San Antonio and were impressed by the Riverwalk. They were also pleased with temperatures in the 70s here.“Usually, it’s like cold,” said Rasmussen, 20, a sophomore, of the weather in Columbia. “Like in the 30s and 40s.”But neither Bodenstab nor Rasmussen packed shorts for this trip.“Our legs are too white,” Rasmussen said.
3250	 2000	a	If Vice President Al Gore has counted on anything in this tumultuous political season, it is that the strong economy will give him the upper hand in the general election should he win the Democratic presidential nomination.The economy remains as strong as ever. But Mr. Gore's strategy for using it to his advantage would have to change -- and could in the end prove to be less potent -- if his Republican opponent turned out to be Senator John McCain rather than Gov. George W. Bush.To Mr. Gore's team, Mr. Bush, who until a few weeks ago seemed to have a lock on his party's nomination, is in many ways the ideal rival. The centerpiece of the Texan's campaign has been his big tax cut, a proposal that Mr. Gore's advisers are certain they could label fiscally irresponsible, a threat to Social Security and a gamble with the current prosperity.When it comes to economic issues, Mr. McCain presents a smaller, more elusive target. While he supports tax cuts, they are of a scale closer to those advocated by Mr. Gore. Like President Clinton and the vice president, Mr. McCain emphasizes that saving Social Security is his first goal. And like the administration, he promotes the long-term benefits of reducing the national debt.

3178	 2001	a	The early estimates prepared by the members of Congress involved in the fund's creation are, they admit, preliminary. But they agreed that the fund was structured to compensate families roughly in line with what they might expect from a court award. In cases of death and severe injury, such awards routinely exceed $1 million. ''Those kinds of numbers were clearly being contemplated,'' said one official involved in the negotiations.The fund's framers said their aim was to offer families an avenue for relief that would be faster and more certain than litigation. But the concerns already raised about how it will operate and whom it will serve suggest it may need refining.The emerging questions and unhappiness about the fund were, in effect, born in compromises made to achieve its passage, according to interviews with a half-dozen Republican and Democratic participants in the process.The basic architecture of the fund was designed in less than 24 hours, with the final passages written at 4 a.m. on Friday, Sept. 21, just hours before the measure was passed by both chambers. Negotiators for both parties said the rush was driven by the demands of airline executives, who had bluntly warned that they would be out of business without immediate financial aid and protection from lawsuits.Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle and House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt had made it clear that there would be no deal for the airlines without compensation for victims. But a disagreement about how best to construct such a system of compensation surfaced.A plan proposed by the White House would have had all victim claims consolidated for trial in federal court in Manhattan, with the government stepping in to pay claims only after the airlines' insurance was exhausted. If victims failed to prove who was to blame for their losses, they would get nothing.Ultimately, though, the real wrangling over the nature of the fund took place when leaders of the Senate and House met in the offices of House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert on the night of Sept. 20.

3644	 1998	a	Right after the Knicks-Heat game last night at Madison Square Garden, Patrick Ewing, the injured Knicks' center, waited to enter the Miami locker room to see his longtime friend and fellow Georgetown alumnus, Alonzo Mourning, who was nursing not only some physical bruises, but also some mental hurts. This followed Mourning's fight on the court with 1.4 seconds left in the fourth quarter with Larry Johnson, the Knicks forward.Ewing came in and spoke quietly to Mourning, as though an older brother saying something about you have to keep your head, when Mourning turned to his friend, and said: ''You saw the stuff he did, dirty,'' and he added an expletive. ''He was doing it the whole game. Cheap shots. Know what I'm saying?''Johnson and Mourning had been going at it for much of the game, when a slap and a push and an elbow and fists suddenly flew.Mourning had said that Johnson had been holding and grabbing him the entire game, a 90-85 Knick victory. ''Sometimes you just have to take a stand,'' Mourning said.

3447	 1999	a	Ms. Goldsmith is 45, one of nine children -- three of them in the cleaning game. Married, with an 8-year-old daughter, she lives in Blue Point, N.Y., the town where she grew up, and commutes from Long Island in a 1994 Ford Explorer. Her hair is cropped short, and the day we met, her imposing build was modestly adorned in jeans and a tweed blazer over a black T-shirt. A faint tinkling sound followed in her wake. This turned out to be the Mexican chime she has worn around her neck, along with a crystal pendant, since being treated for breast cancer last year.As she barked appraisals, I stammered apologies. (I'm neat, not clean.) I told her she didn't have to do my laundry, and I couldn't afford more than one assistant.What time did the freight elevator start running, she wanted to know. She would be bringing equipment. The job would take her eight or nine hours, she figured. (I pay my weekly cleaning lady $60 for half that time)Last year, one New York client refused to pay. ''He thought I was $150 a day for five people, and he stiffed me for $4,500,'' she said. ''Which has never ever happened.'' I promised to pay, and she showed up at 8:30 the next morning, loaded down with gear: a six-foot ladder, her Electrolux vacuum and five shopping bags filled with rags, towels and her own cleaning products.''I don't believe in a wax buildup,'' she said, speaking of the evils of spray furniture polishes. ''We're killing everything!'' Ms. Goldsmith's father was a builder. Her mother was an early convert to holistic living: composting, health food. That, plus the cancer, has made her extremely eco-conscious. She uses chemicals when she has to, like the heavy-duty grout cleaner from the hardware store, but her all-purpose cleanser, Bi-O-Kleen, is made with grapefruit seed and orange peel extracts.Murphy Oil Soap is out, not for chemical reasons, but because she thinks it doesn't work on wood floors, despite the devotion to this product among New York housekeepers. ''It leaves a film,'' she said. ''You can only use it on unfinished wood.'' For floors and almost every other surface, she uses One Wipes, an oil-treated yellow cloth she buys by the crate from a supplier in Wisconsin. (No waxy buildup, she says.) She will use Q-Tips on corners and hinges, and dust delicate objects with a paintbrush. Her biggest cleaning secret: soap and water. And plenty of that bygone commodity called elbow grease.When I left for work, she was pulling down and dusting books by the handful. ''This is an hour,'' she said flatly, digging into my floor-to-ceiling bookshelves. Lenka Bondo, her 24-year-old assistant from the Czech Republic, was sitting on the floor of my bedroom closet, folding. I realized I forgot to hide the ''joke'' underwear someone gave me for my birthday last year. There are no secrets from Ms. Goldsmith and her crew. ''People get embarrassed,'' she said. ''I say: 'Don't worry about it. I'm not perfect.' ''

7444	 1964	a	SAIGON, April 30 (UPI)—A squad of 10 Communist guerrillas penetrated the capital of Long An Province this week, captured 74 former comrades who had defected, and fled with them, American sources disclosed today.The raiders managed to capture the defectors without firing a shot in a stealthy operation that United States sources said had dealt the Saigon Government a severe psychological blow.There was speculation that many of the prisoners would be executed.According to the report, the 10 guerrillas crept into Tan An shortly after midnight Monday. Tan An is 20 miles from Saigon.The report of the raid came as the Government announced the release of 2,109 persons who had been held for political reasons. The announcement was made at a ceremony at Cong Hoa Stadium in Saigon that was presided over by Premier Nguyen Khanh. About 1,200 of those who had been detained were present.

4467	 1993	a	Ammirati & Puris in New York has resigned the Schweppes U.S.A. account after nine years, citing a decline in advertising spending and changes in management at the United States parent, Cadbury Beverages.Ammirati's decision to resign the account, which includes Schweppes ginger ales and mixers and Hires root beer, immediately set off speculation that the agency was hoping to land the account of the Royal Crown Cola Company, headed by John C. Carson, the former president of Cadbury Beverages.Martin Puris, the president and chief executive of the agency, said Schweppes's ad spending had dwindled recently to about $2.5 million from a peak of about $6.5 million. Mr. Puris said he had not talked to Mr. Carson about Royal Crown. Adweek, the trade publication, had reported that Royal Crown might begin a review of its account, now at Crispin & Porter Advertising in Coral Gables, Fla. Adweek estimated that Royal Crown billings might grow to $8 million to $10 million this year.Beth Ostendarp, a spokeswoman for Cadbury Beverages in Stamford, Conn., said a replacement for Ammirati was expected in the next 60 days. She added that the company had not decided whether to continue maintaining separate accounts for its Schweppes brands and its Canada Dry U.S.A. brands, which include Canada Dry ginger ales and mixers and Sunkist soft drinks, or consolidate them.

959	 2013	a	The New York TimesDeal makers may want to keep the Champagne bottles on ice a while longer.Despite a particularly fruitful week in February — when five deals collectively worth more than $91 billion were announced — the business of mergers and acquisitions remains largely stuck in the doldrums.Only 8,115 deals were announced worldwide in the first quarter of this year, the lowest number since 2003, according to data from Thomson Reuters. And while the combined value of $542.8 billion outpaced last year’s first quarter by about 10 percent, it is still 26 percent below the level for the period in 2011.Bankers and lawyers have been publicly boasting about a nascent revival in mergers. In March, 97 percent of deal makers surveyed by the Brunswick Group public relations firm said they expected more deals to be announced in North America this year than in last.But privately, many have conceded that for all of the improvements in the economy and corporate profits, executives still lack the confidence to sign for a big deal.“The M.& A. market remains uneven,” said Scott Lindsay, the global head of mergers and acquisitions at Credit Suisse. “There’s a little bit of everything going on right now. But you would think there would be more activity than there is.”Still, as market indexes like the Dow Jones industrial average set highs, the number of mergers — which historically tracks closely with stock prices — should rise as well, he added. And many advisers caution against judging 2013 by one quarter. Some deals that would otherwise have been announced in the first quarter were moved to fourth quarter 2012 to avoid incurring potentially higher taxes, they said.By some measures, the merger environment has continued to improve steadily. In the United States, the growth in activity nearly single-handedly lifted overall deal volume, with major deals like Dell’s planned sale to its founder and H. J. Heinz’s takeover by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital. The value of transactions announced in the United States for the first quarter jumped nearly 89 percent from a year ago, to $269.8 billion. Other areas of the world have lagged behind, none more so than Europe. The Continent had just 2,705 deals, worth a total of $125.7 billion, in the quarter, down significantly from the period last year.Bankers and lawyers regularly recite the litany of factors that should lead to a wellspring of deals: an improving economy; soaring stock markets; and record low interest rates, courtesy of the Federal Reserve, that make borrowing incredibly cheap. But other factors have weighed on executives’ confidence, including concerns about how events like the bailout of Cyprus may affect the European economy and how America’s budget problems might hamper its growth.Some bankers and lawyers indicate that companies may finally be ready to look beyond the short-term crises, and focus on their specific needs for the long term. “A couple of years ago, something like Greece brought the M.& A. market to a halt,” said Sarkis Jebejian, a partner at Kirkland & Ellis. “I think the trend now is to ask, ‘Does this affect my deal?’ ”In the first quarter, Goldman Sachs narrowly edged out JPMorgan Chase for the lead in Thomson Reuters’s financial league tables, having advised on 83 deals worth a total of $135.9 billion. Goldman’s transactions include advising Dell Inc. in its proposed takeover by Michael S. Dell and Virgin Media in its sale to Liberty Global.Davis Polk & Wardwell claimed the top spot in the legal adviser rankings, having advised on 33 deals worth a total of nearly $109 billion. The firm’s biggest assignment this year was advising Comcast in buying full control of NBCUniversal from General Electric.

4278	 1994	a	The chairman of an important Congressional subcommittee is drafting a proposal to expand Medicare to cover millions of people who lack insurance, as an alternative to President Clinton's health care plan.Under the proposal, devised by Representative Pete Stark, chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, the Government would collect premiums from consumers and employers through the Internal Revenue Service. The proposal would give most Americans the option of enrolling in the new expanded Medicare program or in a private health insurance plan.Mr. Stark said he intended to use his proposal as a basis for negotiation when his panel begins drafting health legislation next week. He briefed White House officials about the proposal on Friday and is trying to round up support on his subcommittee.There is no guarantee that the proposal, the opening shot in what is likely to be a yearlong Congressional battle over health legislation, will be approved by Mr. Stark's subcommittee, much less by the full Ways and Means Committee, the House or the Senate. But Mr. Stark is in a strong position to push for the ideas in his proposal. Goals Are Shared

3776	 1997	a	Senator Lott said earlier in the week that he was concerned that some of Ms. Herman's activities might have come ''awfully close to the edge'' of Federal laws that limit the partisan activities of Government workers. After meeting with Ms. Herman today, the Senator said: ''It was a good meeting. She answered a number of questions I had concerns about.''But he added, ''I still think there is a lot of explanation needed.''The most controversial issue has been the role of Ms. Herman's aides in inviting a Federal bank regulator to meet with Mr. Clinton and some of the nation's most powerful bankers at a coffee meeting sponsored by the Democratic Party last May. White House spokesmen have said that Ms. Herman's office was involved only because of a miscommunication about the nature of the event, and that Ms. Herman decided not to go to the coffee after she learned it was being sponsored by party officials.But the controversy has also focused a broader spotlight on the public liaison office, which promotes grass-roots support for the President's social and economic policies among ethnic, business and civic groups, and how the Administration has used it.Several people who worked in that office in previous Administrations, both Democratic and Republican, said in interviews that officials of the liasion office have historically not had an extensive involvement with party operatives, especially during election campaigns.Anne Wexler, who ran the liaison office under President Jimmy Carter and whose son works for Ms. Herman now, said she occasionally asked the Democratic National Committee if there were any donors it would like her to include in large groups -- usually of 200 or more people -- invited to White House briefings. But she said Mr. Carter rarely met with small groups, and her office was ''never connected in any way with fund raising.''

6167	 1976	a	WASHINGTON, Feb. 29(AP) —The General Accounting Office has found that Congress was not notified of 34 agreements between the United States and South Korea since Congress enacted a reporting requirement in August 1972.The 34 agreements were operating carrying‐out, or agency‐to‐agency agreements and were not reported to the State Department Office of Treaty Affairs the Congres sional investigating agency reported.The Treaty Office has the responsibility to transmit to Congress the text of any “international agreement” within 60 days under the Case Act, sponsored in Congress in 1972 by Senator Clifford P. Case, Republican of New Jersey.But the Accounting Office said the Case Act did not define “international agreements’ and that agencies such as the Agency for International Development which administers foreign aid overseas, and the Defense Department did not consider subordinate agreements subject to the reporting requirement.
124	 2019	a	Since its inception, FOIA has rightly been denounced as a weak and ineffective law, but The Times continues to aggressively pursue documents through the statute, doing what we have done repeatedly over the past 15 years: going to court to challenge the government’s refusal to release materials that the public should see. The Times has brought more FOIA suits over the last decade than any other mainstream media organization in the country.A study by the nonprofit group TRAC found that The Times had filed 31 FOIA lawsuits during the Obama years. Our peer news organizations around the country — the major newspapers, wire services and broadcasters — filed 10, collectively. A subsequent TRAC study found that The Times continued to be the leading filer among media organizations over the first year and a half of the Trump administration. The Times has now filed 27 FOIA lawsuits in the Trump years. (A handful of public interest groups and newer media outlets, in particular BuzzFeed and the Center for Public Integrity, have also been out front in pursuing litigation.)So why do we devote so much time to trying to make a deeply flawed law work?It’s not because it’s easy. Our FOIA litigation is done in house by our now three-lawyer team, with our First Amendment Fellow Al-Amyn Sumar playing the pivotal role. We have been helped in several cases by a FOIA clinic at Yale Law School. We spend hundreds of hours each year filing the suits, writing briefs, negotiating with government lawyers and going to court. We know better than anyone that FOIA cases are frustrating; the deck is stacked against us, and the lawsuits drag on for months and years.But one part of our motivation is pretty simple: We manage to win documents. Between successful court decisions, and settlements in which the agencies agree to reverse course and give us documents, we regularly make a small dent in governmental secrecy.In the past year, we have assisted our reporters in unlocking documents on topics ranging from gun control and herbicides to foreign lobbyists and federal land disputes in the West. In June, The Times published a report about Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao’s efforts to include her relatives in meetings during an official trip to China in October of 2017. Emails obtained through a FOIA lawsuit showed that the trip had been canceled after ethics concerns were raised with officials in the State and Transportation Departments.

2056	 2007	a	CHARLESTON, S.C. – The most famous face in the city at the moment is that of the composer Philip Glass. You see him in miniature and writ huge, on a 38-by-26 foot banner at the Gailliard Auditorium. You see him on posters in store windows and restaurants. You see him walking toward you on the street, on the front of a T-shirt, and as likely as not, the wearer is carrying a program book for the Spoleto Festival U.S.A., with – who else? – Philip Glass on the cover.And he is not even here yet. Beginning on Wednesday, Mr. Glass will present the American premiere of his “Book of Longing,” which has its world premiere tonight in Toronto. A theater piece, it is based on music and images by Leonard Cohen.But the image in question here is the acclaimed “Large Phil Fingerprint/Random” (1979), by Chuck Close. Festival logos in recent years have tended to be more abstract, but this one is concrete and insistent. And not everyone is happy about it, to judge from comments at a private party last night, or even knows who it is.The Charleston Post and Courier reports that it did a quick survey on the street last week, and none of the 21 passersby queried knew who it was. One woman thought it looked like Rocky Balboa. And you know, there is a little resemblance. It would explain, at least, the swollen-looking lips.
4350	 1994	a	The police and other drug experts say the distributor of China Cat may have intentionally put on the market heroin that was virtually undiluted in an attempt to draw customers seeking a more powerful high than is available from other brands. Or, they say, the distributor may have made a mistake. But they are somewhat skeptical about a mistake, because a great deal of money was at stake.A kilogram or 2.2 pounds of heroin costs distributors at least $160,000 in New York, compared with the same amount of cocaine for $18,000 at least. By cutting the heroin in half, the distributor doubles his money. The only brake on the distributor's dilution level, the police and drug experts say, is the competition."If you're selling 50 percent heroin and I'm selling 80 percent heroin, they're going to buy my heroin," said Kenneth McCreary, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration in New York. China Cat Is SuspectedThe latest victim, a man in his late 20's, was found on Tuesday morning, slumped in a parked car on East 97th Street near First Avenue, said Ellen Borakove, the spokeswoman for the New York City Medical Examiner, Dr. Charles S. Hirsch.The police said yesterday that while toxicology tests of the 14 victims were not yet complete, they believed that most or all had taken China Cat. In at least one death, that of the piano tuner, full bags of the brand were found near the body.China Cat, like most other brands of heroin in New York, sells for $10 a bag. The bags contain only a few grains of the drug, even in the highest blends. But for many users, that is enough to send them into a dreamlike stupor for four to six hours. Searching for OriginOne unanswered question is where the China Cat heroin originated, and the police have sought the help of Drug Enforcement Administration technicians. Heroin is produced from opium plants grown mainly in Myanmar and Thailand in Southeast Asia, Pakistan and Afghanistan in Southwest Asia and the southern reaches of the former Soviet Union, as well as in Colombia and Mexico.
3237	 2000	a	For years, the pattern had struck many people in the boxing business as fishy. One after another, Colombian fighters with almost no experience outside Colombia would appear out of nowhere, rise rapidly up the International Boxing Federation's rankings and get a shot at a title. Most of them then lost the title fight and disappeared.Carlos Mercado, a junior bantamweight of little renown, rose to the No. 1 contender's spot, then was soundly beaten by the champion, Robert Quiroga, in 1992. Felix Naranjo, a miniflyweight, also ascended rapidly to contender's status and got a 1993 title fight against the champion, Ratanapol Vorapin of Thailand, who knocked him out in two rounds.Miguel Julio became the top lightweight contender in 1995 with dubious credentials and persuaded the I.B.F. to order the champion at the time, Oscar De La Hoya, to fight him. But De La Hoya gave up the I.B.F. belt instead, saying the match would be an embarrassment. Julio was later whipped by Philip Holliday, a lower-ranked South African.The boxing insiders' suspicions now have firm support. The Colombian fighters' manager, Ivan Feris Chadid, said in a sworn affidavit that he had paid dozens of bribes from 1989 to 1997 to I.B.F. officials to advance his fighters in the rankings.
7477	 1964	a	LONDON, July 31 (AP)—Kenneth Gatland, vice president of the British Interplanetary Society, described the moon landing today as “a stupendous achievement on the path toward placing the first, human. explorers on the moon.”He said that it should scotch criticism that the project of landing man on the moon by 1970 was suffering from lack of information about the physical condition of the lunar surface.

5507	 1987	a	The new American approach would set equal limits on the number of tanks and artillery pieces. The limit would be set at current NATO levels. Some Administration officials said the United States might agree to a proposal that set limits at slightly below NATO levels, as West German officials have said to have suggested.If a limit is set at current NATO levels, the Warsaw Pact would be required to reduce its force of tanks from about 48,000 to about 20,000. On artillery pieces, the Warsaw Pact would have to reduce the number of its weapons from about 36,000 to about 15,000.Some Administration officials said the American approach might be expanded in light of the ongoing consultations to include an additional limit on the number of weapons in the central part of Europe. This could be done by setting a limit on non-indigenous forces stationed on the territory of European nations, such as Soviet tanks in East Germany and American tanks in West Germany. No Limits on AircraftNo limits would be sought on tactical aircraft, an area where NATO has a technological advantage over the Warsaw Pact.Administration officials argued that limits on aircraft are unacceptable because aircraft are ''dual capable'' systems that can carry nuclear-tipped missiles and bombs. NATO has steadfastly refused to include the tactical nuclear weapons in the the talks on conventional arms. The officials also asserted that limits on aircraft would be very hard to verify.But the Soviet Union is expected to seek limits on aircraft and has talked publicly about the need to include tactical nuclear weapons in the new talks.American officials said that there were some differences within the alliance over how to proceed in the talks. West German officials are said to have expressed a concern that a new agreement lead to some reductions on the Western side because West Germany has a declining birth rate and may have to reduce the size of its forces anyway.

It is worth repeating here:But, this is not a collapse, it’s just Las Vegas growing pains. To those who bought homes at the tippy top of the market, I’m sorry. Those homes have dropped a little because they were overpriced. But, overall, prices are higher and higher year after year.

500	 2016	a	How We Got Here
5405	 1987	a	One factor that could help ease the market's reaction is that the prime rate increase simply follows the rise in other rates that has occurred recently in reaction to the decline in the dollar's value and the trade friction between the United States and Japan.Yesterday, the two nations seemed to be trying to smooth over their differences. The United States trade representative, Clayton K. Yeutter, said the stock market on Monday overreacted to a decision by the United States to proceed with tariffs on some Japanese electronics and computer products. Big Board Composite Up 1.33Such talk helped alleviate some of Wall Street's concerns, sending the New York Stock Exchange composite index up 1.33 points yesterday, to 165.89, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up 2.50, to 291.70.The average share gained 34 cents on the Big Board, where advancing issues outnumbered losers by an impressive 993 to 591.Volume slipped, however, to 171.8 million shares yesterday from 208.4 million on Monday, an indication, market analysts say, that investors were not fully comfortable with getting back into the action.That discomfort, as it turned out, may have been fortunate. At the close of business yesterday, and right before the Citibank action, stock index options contracts were trading at lower than normal.For example, the premium on the S.&P. 500 index option contract, which expires in June, gained 0.80 point on the day, while the cash index was up 2.50 points. That alone, market experts say, indicates that program traders will be selling stocks and buying these options at today's opening, a development that could exacerbate any reaction to the rise in the prime rate.

2248	 2006	a	For live updates of Duncan Irving’s coverage of Brazil-France from Frankfurt, click “more” and then “refresh” on your browser.Postgame: So, it’s an all-European final four. France thoroughly deserved this. The team controlled the play throughout, and Brazil never found a way to free up Ronaldinho, who was double-teamed all night and ended up a folorn figure on the left flank. Serves ’em right for playing 4-5-1. After the first 10 minutes, Brazil sat back and waited for the counter. In doing so, they allowed Zidane to control the midfield, which — even though he’s 34 and as we’ve heard ad nauseum about to retire — is still a bad idea. But it took a moment of genius and a beautiful goal to decide this game. It was also a terrific team performance by the French, with every single player playing at the peak of their powers.That’s it from me. Someone will take time out from the July 4 barbecue to bring you Italy-Germany, and Victor Mather will take you through France-Portugal on Wednesday.90+3 Peeeeeeeepppeeeeep!! That’s it! Brazil goes home; France heads into the semis. Cut to crying Brazil fans. The French celebrate.90+3 Zidane picks up a loose ball and slowly dribbles into the Brazil half. Time for one last Brazil attack. The ball flies in to the French box … and Barthez gathers.There will be three minutes of stoppage time now.90+1 Gallas saves Barthez’s hide as he clears a Ronaldo shot that the keeper fans.90 Brazil begins another patient build up before Roberto Carlos hoofs it upfield. France counters through Zidane who passed to Saha. he shoots at Dida.89 Biggest play of the night and Ronaldinho’s free kick whistles just over the bar.88 Yellow card France: Thuram.88 Danger for France here. Ronaldo fouled by Thuram at the edge of the area. Ronaldo sells this one beautifully.Yellow card France: Saha. Keeps on running after the flag goes up for offside.86 Adriano wins a corner off Sagnol. Barthez races out to palm it clear. And the whistle sounds for a foul.85 Substitution France: Henry off, Saha on. That’s it for the subs, those of you playing along at home.83 Ronaldo gets a shot off from 20 yards, but the ball heads wide.82 Henry shoves Cicinho for a free kick on the right. Brazil now begin an attack from their own half. Robinho gets fouled on the right. The ball is decisively cleared by Sagnol at the back.81 Substitution France: Malouda off, Wiltord on.80 Malouda fouls Cicinho on the right. No card, but Brazil is pushing forward in numbers. Robinho gets a half chance and puts it wide.78 Substitution Brazil: Kaka off, Robinho on. Here comes the kitchen sink.76 Substitution France: Ribery off, Govou on. Nothing left in the tank for the French midfielder. A great performance. Govou will be required to hold the ball upfield.76 Substitution Brazil: Cafu off, Cicinho on. The captain’s armband goes to Dida.75 Yellow card Brazil: Rotten foul by Lucio on Henry on the right flank.74 Yellow card France: Sagnol fouls Kaka. Actually, Kaka sold him that.72 Beautiful spin move by Zidane. Evidently, he’s not dead yet.72 Henry shoots at Dida after Vieira and Sagnol mug Ronaldinho on the right.71 Break by Henry, who goes one on one with Lucio, and then plays a great ball to Ribery but Dida races off his line to anticipate and block the shot.70 Brazil switches to a 4-4-2, but it’s a bit desperate now. The team is pushing forward, which means Ribery and Zidane are having fun on the break.68 Zidane, encircled by defenders, finds Sagnol who wins a corner. The ball is cleared and Adriano counters. Much huffing and puffing ensues and the ball eventually goes out for a goal kick.66 Ronaldo stripped by Malouda at the edge of the French area who sets Zidane clear.65 Ribery breaks through, and turns Roberto Carlos inside out, but the Brazil defender saves the day with a desperate lunge at the edge of the area. Roberto Carlos has a bruised gluteus maximus.64 Substitution Brazil: Juninho off, Adriano on.Hey, stop crying, old Brazil fan on the TV. The selecao looks a little lost at the moment, but it only takes one effort. And France does have a comedy keeper.61 Sooooooooo close. Ribery robs Lucio, breaks clear in the box, sends a ball across the goal that Juan nearly puts into his own net.57 GOOOOOOOOOOOAAAALLL: Brazil 0-1 France. Thierrrrrry Henry!!!!!!! Zidane sends in a free kick wide on the left. The ball flies over the defense and Thierry Henry, unmarked and alone at the far post, roofs it with a leaping volley. That was coming, and no more than they deserve. Yeah, he’s a big-game bottler, all right.54 Thuram strips Kaka deep in the French half. Nothing is going right for Brazil at the moment. Zidane plays a wonderful sombrero over Ronaldo.53 Malouda has a free kick on the right. The ball finds Henry, who puts it into the net, but it’s offside. I’m beginning to forget what a goal looks like.52 Close there. Sagnol crosses to Henry in the box. The Arsenal man backheels for Vieira, but his shot is blocked and the ball goes out for a corner.51 Dida plunks in an up and under in the vain hope of finding Ronaldo. He’s so isolated, and Brazil is so bogged down, they’re hoofing it like Norway. Or England.49 Henry breaks down the left flank and crosses low into the box, but the ball is cleared.48 Oops. Barthez screws up and flubs Ze Roberto’s cross. This is better from Brazil.47 Ronaldinho, double-teamed, wins a corner that Thuram clears.46 We’re back and Zidane starts things off with a fine free kick into the box. Vieira cuts in ahead of Henry and heads wide.Halftime: Brazil 0-0 France. Well, Brazil survives a very poor half, but only just. The TV crews have made endless references to Zidane’s age, but he looks like a spring chicken compared to Cafu and Roberto Carlos. Meanwhile Ronaldinho just hasn’t had much of the ball; the French have figured out that Brazil flows through him, and they’ve done a great job squeezing him out, and chasing down every 50-50 ball in midfield. Parreira has a lot of homework to do during the break. And as for Domenech, his players will be reminding him that if it ain’t broke …45+1 Ball advances another five yards. Every Brazilian bar one is in the wall. Zidane and Henry debate. Zidane fires it at the wall and the ball pings around the box for a bit before Vieira’s final shot is blocked and the whistle goes for halftime.45 Yellow card Brazil: Ronaldo for handball.45 Free kick France 24 yards out. Henry fires at the wall. The ball catches Ronaldo’s hand.Yellow card Brazil: Late challenge by Juan brings down Viera from behind, after Zidane had set Vieira off on one of those surging runs. Juan is lucky to stay on here. Either way, he’s out of the next game.41 Kaka now, coughs it up to Zidane and the French head forward again. The final ball has been consistently lacking, but Malouda and Abidal are causing Cafu all kinds of problems.41 Abidal finds Malouda on the left, but the ball is cleared in the box by Cafu, who wellies it for a throw-in.39 Zidane backs into Cafu and concedes a free kick. A rarity: Brazil has possession. It ends with Cafu hitting a hopeful ball toward the far post, while Ronaldinho stands a yard to his left, screaming for the ball.38 Long useless clearance by Roberto Carlos. Brazil’s defenders are struggling and Cafu fouls Malouda. Hey, there’s our favorite Red Bull, Youri Djorkaeff. He’s here for the game, but away from his MLS team for personal reasons. Here’s a hint: he’s at the game.35 Vieira getting more involved now, which is freeing up both Makelele and Zidane. Vieira now strips Ronaldinho and plays another ball forward.33 Ribery goes one on one with Roberto Carlos. The Brazilian wins the throw, but Ribery looks like he’s giving him trouble.32 Nasty block by Gilberto Silva on Ribery. Where are the Brazilians? Free kick cleared by Juan in the goalmouth.31 Good possession by France and they win another corner. Malouda’s corner is punched out by Dida.29 Ronaldo gets a rare break, but his shot is snuffed out by Thuram.29 Another troubling corner for Brazil. It’s cleared to Ronaldinho, who’s upended by Makelele.28 Zidane is running the show deep on the left. Abidal finds Malouda, whose cross from the left is sent behind by Roberto Carlos’ head.25 Lucio fouls Henry 35 yards out on the left. Zidane sends a looping ball over the goal. Bit of a waste that.24 Yellow card Brazil: Cafu, for getting stripped by Abidal and then tugging the Frenchman’s shirt.24 Odd to see Brazil relying on the counter. France is looking very assured at the moment, passing the ball confidently around. Ronaldo’s getting a workout, though, which should relieve his sizeist critics.21 Lucio wins a duel with Henry but concedes a corner. More legs go flying and the ball is cleared by Brazil. Cafu plays a stinker of a ball to Ronaldo.20 Kaka tries to lay one on for Ronaldo, but you can guess what happens.19 Did you know this could be Zidane’s last match? This is JP Dellacamera’s mantra for the second straight game. I’m back on HD now, which is the only thing that makes it bearable viewing. That, and Shelli Smith’s 3D scary coming atcha hands.18 Ronaldinho tries another one to Ronaldo, who puffs after the ball but Barthez smothers.16 Vieira — nice of him to join us — and gets thumped in the back by Juan for a free kick. Sagnol runs down the right and shoots at Dida who bounces it down and then catches it.15 Ronaldinho, who has a free role as provider, tries a pass to Junhinho, but it’s a little too far. Another one to Kaka goes behind for a goal kick.14 France pushing hard as bodies go flying in the box. The ball goes behind for a France corner. Zidane takes it ,and Dida punches the ball out to Ribery who volleys over.12 Makelele crosses to Henry, who turns and shoots. It’s a tame effort and the ball is cleared.11 Henry shoots from 30 yards. The ball is smacked off Lucio’s head and goes behind. Lucio takes it hard and stays down, and is escorted off the field.10 Brazil has started the brighter of the two, and Kaka wins a free kcik about 30 yards out on the right . Ronaldinho tees up, and sends it toward the far post, where Ronaldo heads over.9 Sagnol concedes a corner (actually it comes off Roberto Carlos, but the ref doesn’t care). It’s a short one — why do they bother with short ones, they never work — and Roberto Carlos sends it sailing into the stands.7 A lot of feeling out at the moment. Zidane is being shadowed by Gilberto Silva, who, I believe, had the same job for Arsenal against Real Madrid.5 Zidane fouls Kaka in a similar spot. Juninho takes it again and plays it to Juan, who’s about 10 yards offside.runs4 Juninho takes the kick and it clips the wall and runs off for a corner. Barthez punches the corner clear.3 Ronaldinho is double-teamed by Ribery and Gallas. A dangerous free kick beckons just outside the area. Roberto Carlos wants it.2 Juninho tries to feed Cafu but the ball on the right is too far.1 We’re off. France in white playing right to left; Brazil in yellow. Zidane starts with a nifty piece of skill, juking past a trio of defenders but the ball to Henry is a poor one.A couple of hearty national anthems, and Setanta and the host German feed point out Jacques Chirac. The two ageing galacticos, Ronaldo and Zidane hug it out and then all players pose behind an anti-racism banner.Pregame:Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz! Well, that was a real thriller wasn’t it? Like sitting through a grade school talent show, or a support act that just. wouldn’t. leave. So, bye-bye England, sent packing by Cristiano Ronaldo, the human equivalent of World Cup mascot Goleo (long neck, won’t give the ball up, and deeply unpopular). Anyone else catch the pub footage on ABC? I was sort of hoping for an England win just to see the mad fan in the front’s head explode. But never mind, there’s always another shootout to lose around the corner.So having gone 1-2 on my quarterfinal predictions, and losing my 8-1 shots, Argentina, at the bookies (hey, at least they knew how to make a dignified exit), the world can now turn its attention to France-Brazil, a real clash. Is France Brazil’s bogey team? Do the geriatrics of les bleus have one more trick up their sleeves before Zizou rides off into the sunset, Lucky Luke-style? Or will Brazil wake up and play the French off the park? So, France it is then. There, if that isn’t a 3-0 win for Brazil, I don’t know what is.Having taught the young pups of Spain a thing or two (ie matches are played over 90 minutes), France takes the field with an unchanged lineup. Zidane, Patrick Vieira and Frank Ribery are all on yellow cards.Brazil brings Gilberto Silva into the midfield in place of Emerson, and there is no place for Adriano in the lineup. In comes long-range specialist and deadball expert Juninho Pernambucano. Does that mean portly striker Ronaldo has to play up front alone? Will we see two 4-5-1s today? Or will Ronaldinho be given a role in the hole? Either way, Juan is on a yellow.In case you’ve stumbled in here by accident, this is a rematch of the 1998 World Cup Final, and the 1986 World Cup quarterfinal, both of which were won by France. In fact, you have to go back to 1958 for Brazil’s lone success against the French, a 5-2 win in the semifinals, back when a certain Pele made his World Cup debut.Todays lineups:BrazilDidaCafuLucioJuanRoberto CarlosZe RobertoGilberto SilvaJuninhoRonaldinhoKakaRonaldoFranceBarthezSagnolGallasThuramAbidalMaloudaMakeleleVieiraZidaneRiberyHenryReferee: Luis Medina Cantalejo

7414	 1964	a	The State Liquor Authority's drive against concealed ownership in drinking places resulted in the cancellation in the last week of four liquor licenses in this city and on Long Island.The license of a fifth place was canceled because the owner had also operated a supper club that had lost its liquor license when it was found to be a congregating place of homosexuals.Licenses canceled for concealed ownership involved Grove Bowling Inc., at 17 Grove Street, Brooklyn; Mike's Island Park Lanes, at 256 Long Beach Road. Island Park, L. I.; the Staff Inn Bar & Grill, 150 Columbus Avenue near 67th Street, and the Capo De Flores Restaurant, 2082 Madison Avenue.Charges against the Staff Inn included also permitting the premises to become disorderly and catering to homosexuals who conducted themselves in an offensive manner.

3448	 1999	a	A Union County jury yesterday convicted a minister in Jersey City of charges that he sexually assaulted a girl in his parish over a six-year period beginning when she was 10 years old.The assaults began in the summer of 1991, after the minister, William J. Gray, 41, met the victim at St. Mary's Evangelical Christian Church on Martin Luther King Drive, said Doreen Yanik, an assistant Union County prosecutor. The assaults began as touching and escalated as the victim got older, Ms. Yanik said.Mr. Gray faces up to 20 years in prison on the most serious of the nine counts against him, aggravated sexual assault. But Ms. Yanik said she would ask for a life sentence because of his convictions for assault and drug dealing in 1980 and 1986.His lawyer, Robert A. Seelenfreund, said he would appeal. He said the victim had made three similar accusations against other people, all of them unsubstantiated.

411	 2016	a	On Super Tuesday, as in New Hampshire a few weeks ago, Donald Trump basically has the devil’s luck.In the days before Tuesday’s slew of primaries, there were signs that Trump might be pulling away, expanding his support beyond the rough one-third of the party that’s backed him since last summer. One poll had him at 49 percent nationally, another at 40 percent in Virginia, another close to Ted Cruz in Texas. There was the Chris Christie endorsement, the Jeff Sessions endorsement — and yes, the K.K.K. business, but the “Trump Is Inevitable” drumbeat on cable news and Twitter sometimes seemed to drown that controversy out.But in the end, Trump’s numbers were impressive but not at all a race ender. The states in play were mostly up and down what you might call the Trump Belt — the swath of America, extending from the Deep South up through Appalachia and into New England, where his unusual coalition is strongest. Yet he won less than half the night’s delegates, with vote totals still in the 35 percent range — peaking in Massachusetts and Alabama (an amazing combination), but falling into the 20s outside the Trump Belt (in Oklahoma, Texas, Minnesota) and holding in the 30s elsewhere.For a candidate who is not only opposed but feared as a race-baiting demagogue by almost the entire party establishment, who looks less electable than any of his rivals in the fall, who has prominent conservatives (including, this week, a sitting United States senator) lining up to swear they’ll never vote for him, who is basically in undeclared war with the last Republican president and the last two party nominees — for such a candidate, 35 percent of the vote still does not seem like it should be enough to win through to the nomination.Yet the Super Tuesday results did nothing, nothing, to clarify who exactly might win it instead. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are locked in a bizarre standoff, where each one has an entirely plausible claim to be the not-Trump candidate, and neither has a clear reason to depart the race.

4954	 1990	a	LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton, the French liquor and luxury-products company, moved to increase its stake in Guinness P.L.C. to 24 percent, in line with the British liquor company's stake in LVMH. LVMH said the move was part of an agreement reached with Guinness in 1988 to hold equal stakes in each other. Guinness said it welcomed the move.LVMH is raising its Guinness stake by offering to pay as much as $13.86 a share for up to 59.4 million Guinness shares. The French company's holdings include 42.8 million shares acquired today. These purchases plus the tender offer will cost a total of about $1.4 billion, LVMH said.

2437	 2005	a	New File-Sharing Techniques Are Likely to Test Court Decision Briefly buoyed by their Supreme Court victory on file sharing, Hollywood and the recording industry are on the verge of confronting more technically sophisticated opponents. Last week, one software designer described a new version of a peer-to-peer file-sharing system that he says will make it easier to share digital information anonymously and make detection by corporations and governments far more difficult. Others have described similar efforts. The issue is complicated by the fact that the small group of technologists designing the new systems say their goal is to create tools to circumvent censorship and political repression -- not to abet copyright violation. [C1.]Behind Murdoch Departure, a Family Rift The sudden exit of Rupert Murdoch's elder son Lachlan from his job at the News Corporation came amid family tensions, people close to the Murdochs said; the chief issue is said to have been Lachlan's feeling that his father interfered in his business dealings and undermined him. [C1.]Creating Movie Theaters for Multilingual Audiences Moctesuma Esparza, left, a film and television producer, just opened the first megaplex of the Maya Cinemas theater chain he dreamed up five years ago to serve the growing number of Latino moviegoers. Mr. Esparza says Latino audiences "want to see movies where they get to see themselves." Mr. Esparza has big expansion plans for the chain; by next year, he expects to add new multiplexes, totaling 65 screens, in Bakersfield and Inglewood, Calif., and in Santa Fe and Santa Ana Pueblo, N.M. In each theater, one or two screens will be set aside for showing Spanish-language or other foreign and independent films.

2813	 2003	a	Vivendi's American entertainment assets include film and television studios, the USA and Sci-Fi cable channels, and an interest in the Universal theme park business. Those assets, known as Vivendi Universal Entertainment, include the Universal Music business, though the music company is not for sale.NBC has long been Vivendi's favored bidder, despite the fact that its offer includes little in the way of cash, because of General Electric's strong management reputation. NBC is offering Vivendi a partnership in a combined NBC-Universal entertainment conglomerate, in which it could sell its stake over a period of time or possibly through an initial offering of the unit. By agreeing on a deal without any cash now, Vivendi would be betting that NBC's management will help raise the value of the combined unit so much that it is worth waiting to cash out later.Mr. Bronfman's group, on the other hand, would buy a majority stake in Vivendi's entertainment assets -- with at least $8 billion in cash -- valuing the entire company at a little more than $12 billion, but less than the $14 billion V9ivendi is said to be seeking.Mr. Bronfman spent the day yesterday in conference calls with Vivendi board members and executives, hoping to leverage his old relationships with them in a way to induce the company to reconsider his proposal. Among others, Mr. Bronfman is said to have a longstanding relationship with Paul Fribourg, chief executive of an agribusiness company, the ContiGroup Companies, who was named to the Vivendi Universal board last year. Mr. Fribourg is also close to Jean-René Fourtou, Vivendi's chairman, and sometimes advises him on dealings in the United States.But Mr. Bronfman's hard-charging negotiating tactics may have backfired. According to the executives, recent comments of his quoted in press accounts that were critical of NBC's offer enraged many members of Vivendi's board and especially provoked the ire of Mr. Fourtou.On Thursday, Mr. Bronfman, who remains a large shareholder in Vivendi, told The Financial Times that a deal between Vivendi and NBC would be ''exactly the wrong outcome,'' adding that NBC executives ''have never run a studio, an entertainment cable network or a theme park.''If the decision goes NBC's way, tomorrow's board meeting may end an almost yearlong competition for the Vivendi Universal assets. Beyond NBC and Mr. Bronfman's group, as well as Liberty Media, Viacom and MGM, expressions of interest have come from the Comcast Corporation and from a group headed by the investor Marvin Davis.But if talks with NBC drag on, the uncertainty could affect Vivendi's underlying business. Just last week, Ron Meyer, the president of Universal Studios, acknowledged that the auction process was taking something of a toll within Universal.

The members are Vinicio Cerezo, the Christian Democratic Party presidential candidate; Msgr. Oriano Quilici, the papal nuncio, and Eduardo Meyer Maldonado, university rector.
240	 2018	a	Serena Williams started so strong on Sunday that she looked to be in fourth gear.

6088	 1977	a	EAST HARTFORD, Aug. 31—Frank Daniel DeCorleto, the convicted murderer who killed his wife and 4‐year‐old son and then committed suicide yesterday, had won custody of the child from a previous marriage because the child's mother was too afraid of him to fight for the boy, according to the lawyer who represented her in the custody fight.“He always had guns,” said Michael J. Graham, the Hartford lawyer who represented the mother, Kathy DeCorleto. “He pulled a gun on her and pointed it at her head.“He was just visiting with Frankie for, like, a couple of days a week. One time he just didn't return Frankie. She was just afraid to fight back.“It wasn't just simply that she gave up after a year of fighting. She was really worn down from that battle.”

5708	 1985	a	Two gunmen forced a supermarket manager to a back office Saturday night and shot him fatally in the head while his wife was kept outside the office.The victim, 39-year-old Mario Burgio of Lindenhurst, was dead at the Foodtown store on Austin Boulevard and Long Beach Road.The police reported that Mr. Burgio's wife, Patricia, had just arrived at the store at about 10 P.M. when the gunmen, both described as in their early 20's, confronted them in a holdup attempt. After Mr. Burgio was taken to the office, his wife heard a shot ring out, the police said.Mrs. Burgio was not hurt.The two men tried first to escape through the rear of the store but, unable to do so, broke a front window and fled, according to the police.
3104	 2001	a	Investigators arrested a police memorabilia dealer yesterday after confiscating more than 5,000 authentic-looking police badges from his Yonkers home.

It is legal to make and sell mock badges unless they resemble the real thing so closely that they could be used to impersonate an officer, officials said. ''The average person would not know the difference,'' Lt. John Zerillo, commander of the Police Impersonation Unit for the New York Police Department, said of Mr. Sash's badges. Officials said Mr. Sash had played bit parts in the television program ''Law and Order.'' Kevin Flynn (NYT)
4576	 1992	a	President Bush met with Prime Minister Li Peng of China today for the first time since Mr. Li presided over Beijing's crackdown on democracy campaigners in 1989.Mr. Bush went ahead with the chilly, 20-minute encounter despite critics' charges that even a brief meeting would buttress the international standing of the Chinese Government and Mr. Li. The President contends that such contacts are worthwhile as a means of tempering Beijing's behavior through dialogue. Hundreds of people protested against the meeting outside.The meeting took place in a conference room here after both leaders attended the summit meeting of leaders of nations represented on the Security Council.Barely an hour before they met, the State Department issued its annual worldwide human rights report, in which China was accused of an array of abuses and described as a repressive regime "falling far short of internationally accepted norms."

294	 2017	a	From its premise and pedigree, the Freeform series “Beyond” seems as if it should have more surprises than it does. The show is built to be mind-bending but doesn’t have the requisite urgency to entice you aboard for the ride. Instead, you have to force yourself to stay with it until about the four-hour mark, when it finally gets a bit of traction.Holden, the central character, is a boy when Monday’s two-hour premiere begins, but only long enough to be injured in an accident. He spends the next 12 years in a coma and is a young adult when, to the shock of everyone, he suddenly wakes up. It’s not only his awakening that baffles medical science; he is also in fine physical shape despite a dozen years of immobility.Holden’s mental condition, though, is another matter — he is jolted periodically by visions of some sort of hellscape. In the real world, meanwhile, he soon realizes that he is being pursued by ruthless people whose motives are not immediately clear.Burkely Duffield, who plays the grown-up Holden, is too flavorless to grab your attention and sympathy with the thin material he is given in the early episodes. We learn almost nothing about Holden before the coma, so when we meet him again 12 years later he’s basically a stranger. It’s hard to root for or care about someone we barely know.

1818	 2008	a	Updated, 5:27 p.m. | The notion that New York’s Jewish electorate could be easily characterized has long been debatable. But the looming primary election on Tuesday is raising new speculation about how strongly Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama will appeal to Jewish Democrats.“I don’t speak for the Jewish community,” said former Mayor Edward I. Koch, “and nobody speaks for the Jewish community. The Jews, individually, speak for themselves.”And though these days he, himself, is speaking up for Senator Clinton, Mr. Koch acknowledges that “lots of people — Jews and others — will be voting for Barack.”Indeed, “it’s almost an embarrassment of riches for the Jewish voter,” said Ammiel Hirsch, senior rabbi of the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. “Perhaps there is a certain amount of distress that they have to choose between the two, because they are both enormously appealing to the Jewish community.”He added, “It is a very exciting time for us, because I think the Jewish primary vote in the New York area is up for grabs in the next five days.”To Sid Davidoff, a senior partner at one of New York’s largest lobbying firms who is not working for either of the campaigns, “I think there is going to be a split between established older voters in the Jewish community, with whom Hillary will do well, and younger and more liberal Jews who see Obama as an agent of change.”Although it would seem likely that Senator Clinton might capture the larger share of voters in her stronghold state, including Jews, even the slightest shift in Jewish support is a subject of interest. Some local blogs recently claimed that Councilman Simcha Felder of Brooklyn had switched his support to Senator Obama from Senator Clinton.A spokesman for the councilman, Eric Kuo, said Thursday that Mr. Felder has not campaigned for either candidate, or previously announced support. Then, during a radio program on Tuesday night, according to Mr. Kuo, Councilman Felder said that he would be voting for Senator Obama.An important reason for such intense scrutiny is that “the Jewish community tends to vote, and make contributions, far in excess of its proportion of the population,” said Gary Rosenblatt, editor and publisher of Jewish Week, the nation’s largest Jewish weekly.Exit polls from the 2006 New York governor’s race showed 87 percent of the Jewish population voting Democratic and 12 percent voting Republican; in the 2004 exit polls, about 8 percent of the New York vote was Jewish. A phenomenal 83 percent of voting-age Jewish adults were registered to vote — some 863,000 people — in the five boroughs of New York City plus Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester Counties, according to a U.J.A. Federation of New York report in 2002 that was released in 2004.Not everyone is being swept away by the primary deadline, of course.“Generally speaking, I am suspicious of all politicians on the Jewish issue,” said Marvin Kitman, a media critic for The Huffington Post. “With friends like them we don’t need enemies. The basic question we of the Hebrew persuasion tend to ask on all issues, whether it is the Giants in the Super Bowl, or Amy Winehouse, or global warming, is: Is it good or bad for the Jews?”This week, trying to make it clear that he is good for the Jews, Senator Obama answered questions from reporters at Jewish news outlets in a conference call. His aim was to counter concerns about his positions on issues like his hope for a dialogue with Iran, saying that the control of nuclear weapons by Iran would be a threat to Israeli and United States interests. He added that he had long spoken against anti-Semitism, and had always denounced the views of Louis Farrakhan.In the Senate, Senator Obama backed Israel during its 2006 war with Hezbollah in Lebanon, and in the Monday conference call he said that Palestinians must control terrorist activity and violent anti-Israel actions before Israel should make concessions.Both senators “are supportive of Israel, and few question that,” said Rabbi Steve Gutow, executive director of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, a nonprofit group that promotes consensus among Jewish groups and oversees the Israel Advocacy Initiative, which tries to communicate pro-Israel views.The American Jewish Committee and other Jewish groups have criticized a campaign of e-mails that made false claims that Senator Obama was, among other things, a secret Muslim. (He is a Christian who has attended Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago since the 1980s.)“I think Obama has dealt effectively with those rumors that he is really a secret agent,” Mr. Rosenblatt said.And to Rabbi Hirsch, “Most Jews are too sophisticated to fall for that garbage,” he said, adding, “It’s almost embarrassing that there would be an attempt to sway us in that manner.”As for Senator Clinton, “I don’t think the Suha issue has any resonance anymore,” Mr. Koch said. In 1999, Mrs. Clinton attended an event in Ramallah where the wife of Yasir Arafat, Suha, accused Israel of poisoning Palestinian women and children with toxic gases. Mrs. Clinton listened with obvious discomfort but left politely, giving Mrs. Arafat a kiss.Mrs. Arafat’s remarks were denounced by Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, and in New York, Mrs. Clinton was criticized in newspaper editorials and by several groups for her silence and the kiss. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, then a possible Senate candidate, sharply attacked her.Mr. Koch added: “I said that Suha wasn’t an issue in a Hillary commercial then. And I’d say it again in a commercial now if she asked me.”Both senators are still looking for endorsements, and hoping that the ones they have will influence Tuesday’s vote. “Both Hillary and Obama have prominent people in the Jewish community supporting them,” Mr. Rosenblatt said.Aside from Mr. Koch, prominent Jewish politicians supporting Mrs. Clinton include New York’s other senator, Charles E. Schumer; Senator Dianne Feinstein of California; and Representatives Gary L. Ackerman of Queens, Eliot L. Engel of the Bronx, Jerrold L. Nadler of Manhattan and Anthony D. Weiner of Queens and Brooklyn.Among Senator Obama’s supporters are several Jewish members of Congress: Representatives Steve Rothman of New Jersey, Adam B. Schiff of California, Jan Schakowsky of Illinois and Robert Wexler of Florida.Although the candidates have focused on public appearances in other states, “my sense is that there is a huge amount of enthusiasm for both candidates in the Jewish community, and that both represent an important breakthrough in American political and social life,” Rabbi Hirsch said.He added: “The community was disproportionately active in favor of the civil-rights movement, and so the prospect of an African-American president is enormously moving for the Jewish community. But then, the prospect of a woman president is also very moving for the Jewish community.”In the American Jewish Committee’s national Annual Survey of American Jewish Opinion, 70 percent of Jewish Democrats said they had a favorable opinion of Senator Clinton, in comparison with 45 percent for Senator Obama. The telephone poll in November studied 1,000 self-identifying Jewish respondents in a sample that had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.A victory in New York’s Jewish community for Senator Obama would be remarkable. “In the Chicago community Jewish voters know Obama well and like him,” said Malcolm I. Hoenlein, vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, an umbrella organization that focuses on Jewish issues. “But in New York, Jewish voters don’t know him well.”None would predict who would sway Jewish voters on Tuesday. “I think that the Jewish vote is supporting Hillary at this point,” Mr. Davidoff said. “But Obama has the buzz. And with the primary less than a week away, this is very volatile.”Read more Primary Journal blog entries from the New York region.
2523	 2004	a	Three more things to know about the process: First, no article is guaranteed publication. Everything is written on spec. This applies to all articles, even those we commission. (Op-Ed is not a one-way street. We frequently call up people and invite them to write for us.) Second, what comes to Op-Ed stays in Op-Ed. Your ideas are not passed on to our Times colleagues for their use. Third, because we receive so many submissions, we cannot respond to everyone who sends us an article. If you haven't heard from us within three business days, you should assume that we are not going to be able to use your submission.Are there guidelines for submitting an article? You bet. Shoot for about 750 words -- though it's worth remembering that some terrific and influential Op-Ed pieces have been as short as 300 words. Move quickly, the news does. Eschew, um, I mean, stay away from Olympian language and bureaucratic jargon (infrastructure, inputs, outlays). Write the article the way you'd like to write it -- not the way you think The Times wants you to write it. Make one argument thoroughly, point by point; the more detail the better. If you try to do too much, you can wind up with an article that, in striving to say everything, ends up saying nothing.Also, you shouldn't feel that you have to rely on the written word alone. Maybe your point is expressed best in a chart, a graphic, an annotated illustration or a series of photographs. We're open to just about anything, so long as it's acceptable in a family newspaper. (Open letters to the president don't have a great history of success.)A few other guidelines. Submissions must be exclusive. If you want us to consider your work, please send it here first. We don't publish articles that have appeared in other American publications, and we rarely publish reprints of any kind. Contributors generally must let several months go by between appearances on the page. For more information on the submissions process, please see the box at the end of this article.What happens once an article is accepted? It will start with a phone call or an e-mail message from an editor at Op-Ed. You'll be asked to sign a contract giving The Times the right, among other things, to distribute the article online and via other newspapers. Once the article has been scheduled for publication -- it could be days or even months after acceptance -- we'll edit and fact-check your work. Then we'll send you a copy for review. Nothing appears in the paper until the writer has signed off on the edited version.There are, however, two zones of editorial privilege. We choose the illustrations, which are created by artists to complement specific articles and are overseen by our art director. And we write the headlines. Contributors have no say in these matters. (You're in good company -- Times reporters don't write their headlines, either.) At the end of the day, you'll receive a moderate payment.All of our writers are obviously opinionated about their subjects, but we try very hard to make sure our readers know if they have a financial or professional interest. Contributors are asked a lot of specific questions toward that end. In addition, we try to give readers enough information -- the dateline and identification line, for example -- so they can find out more about writers if they wish. Sadly, mistakes happen. When they do, we do our utmost to correct them quickly. (Op-Ed corrections appear on the Op-Ed page.)

4949	 1990	a	The Merrill Lynch Asset-Backed Corporation 1990-1 yesterday priced $622 million in debt securities due in 1995 that are backed by Chrysler Credit Corporation car loans.The offering is being handled through Merrill Lynch Capital Markets as sole manager. Underwriters said the 9 3/4 percent securities were priced at 99 24/32 to yield 9.22 percent, or about 75 basis points more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity.Moody's Investors Service Inc. and the Standard & Poor's Corporation have both rated the issue triple-A.
2065	 2007	a	I just watched the end of the Twins/Tigers game on ESPN. The Tigers won, 1-0. Marcus Thames hit a home run in the bottom of the eighth inning, and Jeremy Bonderman got the win. He’s 9-1. (Gary Sheffield didn’t play.)Two thoughts crossed my mind. One is that, if the Indians maintain their 98-win pace and capture the Central, the Yankees won’t catch the Tigers for the wild card. The other is that the Tigers had to suffer a lot to be this good, and the Yankees have not suffered for 15 years.When the Tigers dealt Jeff Weaver and his long-term contract to the Yankees in a three-way trade in 2002, they got back Bonderman, who then was 19 years old, from the Oakland A’s. They let him struggle in the majors for a while, and he was there when the Tigers lost 119 games in 2003. Their prize for such futility was an ace, Justin Verlander, who was drafted with the No. 2 pick overall the next season.Then there’s Thames. He came up as a Yankee and was traded to Texas in ’03 for Ruben Sierra, who was useful for a while. The Tigers wound up with Thames, and they’re glad they have him now.The Yankees, at 37-41, are going through growing pains. Clearly, because of their payroll, they’re built to win now. They have a dozen players under contract for $10 million or more this season. That’s the price of veterans with track records. And for years, that was basically the only kind of player the Yankees would seek.They’d like to get younger, but it’s hard. They have Chien-Ming Wang, Melky Cabrera and Robinson Cano. They have Phil Hughes and a bunch of other live arms in the minors. But they have a real dearth of young position players.Maybe the next chance they have to trade for a pitcher, they’ll look forward and take the Bonderman type instead of the Weaver type. Maybe they’ll hold onto the young, productive, and cheap position players like Thames, and give him a real chance.The problem is, they’re still the Yankees, and they have a reputation to maintain, a cable network to feed, a new stadium coming the same year as the Mets’ new building, and a rabid fan base that pays lots of money to watch a team that’s competitive both now and in the future.It’s a complicated vision GM Brian Cashman is trying to articulate, and if he keeps his job, it will be fascinating to see if he can pull it off. This year, clearly, it’s just not working.

3557	 1999	a	Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students examine the creation of the Northern Ireland Assembly as an historic step in the peace process in Northern Ireland. Students work in four small groups, each exploring the history and objectives of one of the parties represented in the new assembly, and then investigate the backgrounds and views of cabinet members from their parties. Students present cabinet member information in the form of press statements to be shared at a ‘press conference.’Author(s):Alison Zimbalist, The New York Times Learning NetworkSuggested Time Allowance: 1 hourObjectives:Students will:1. Understand basic information about the history of Northern Ireland, the new Northern Ireland Assembly, and the relationships among the parties represented in it.2. Explore, in small groups, the history, objectives, and individual cabinet member views of the four parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly; present information from the perspectives of party members.3. Examine the creation of the Northern Ireland Assembly as an historic step in the peace process in Northern Ireland by reading and discussing “Both Sides Join to Pick New Cabinet For Ulster.”4. Investigate, in smaller groups, the backgrounds and views of cabinet members from their parties and write press statements sharing this information to be presented at a “press conference” in a later class.Resources / Materials:-paper-pens/pencils-teacher-created flags of the four parties involved in the Northern Ireland Assembly (can be obtained from their Web sites; URLs given in the lesson plan), one flag per party drawn on a large piece of paper titled with the party’s name-computers with Internet access (minimum of four)-copies of “Both Sides Join to Pick New Cabinet For Ulster” (one per student)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Prior to students’ arrival in class, arrange desks in four groups in different corners of the room, and post the flag of a party represented in the Northern Ireland Assembly over each group. Upon entering class, divide students equally into these groups and explain that they are going to be exploring the objectives of their party. Give students some basic background about the history of Northern Ireland and these parties’ relationships with one another. Then, ask students to brainstorm what they think they need to know about their party, and jot ideas on the board.2. Each group researches their assigned party using Internet resources, answering the following questions and any others from the initial brainstorm that the class feels are important in understanding their parties (written on the board for easier student reference):–When was this party created?–What are this party’s objectives?–Who are the cabinet members in the Northern Ireland Assembly from this party, and what are the key positions of each on the other parties, the future of Northern Ireland, and other critical topics?Provide the official Web site addresses of these parties to each group as a starting point for research:Ulster Unionists (//www.uup.org/)Democratic Unionists (//www.dup.org.uk/)Social Democratic and Labor Party (//www.sdlp.ie/)Sinn Fein (//www.sinnfein.ie/)3. Each group briefly presents the information found through their research from the perspectives of members of their party (in other words, in the first person.)4. Now equipped with a better understanding of the Northern Ireland peace process and the parties involved in the Northern Ireland Assembly, read and discuss “Both Sides Join to Pick New Cabinet For Ulster,” focusing on the following questions:a. What is the historic significance of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the newly selected cabinet members?b. Why would the inclusion of Sinn Fein members in the cabinet be controversial?c. What is the importance of representing both Protestant and Catholic parties in this assembly?d. What tensions already exist between some of the members of the cabinet? Discuss your response.e. What views of a united Ireland are expressed by cabinet members quoted in the article? Why would this assembly want to include people who aim to fight against a united Ireland? (Ask groups to briefly re-present the views of their cabinet members mentioned in the article.)f. What previous attempts at creating this assembly have been thwarted, and how were they mended?g. What occurrences happened at this meeting, and how do they reflect the current political climate of Northern Ireland?h. What is the IRA, and what about it was discussed by the assembly?i. What is the historic significance of “the British parliament (passing) home rule authority from London to Belfast”?j. After researching the parties and reading this article, speculate on the future of the Northern Ireland Assembly.5. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Divide students’ groups into as many pairs or smaller groups as there are cabinet members in the Northern Ireland Assembly from their party (Ulster Unionists- 4, Democratic Unionists- 2, Social Democratic and Labor Party- 4, Sinn Fein- 2). Each of these smaller groups then selects a cabinet member from their party as the focus of some deeper research on his or her background and views. Each group then writes a press statement sharing this information to be presented at a “press conference” in a later class. At the press conference, members of the press (the classmates in the audience) should jot down questions about this person’s statement on index cards and submit them for answers either immediately or in a later “Northern Ireland Assembly conference” (round-table discussion).Further Questions for Discussion:–Along what lines is Northern Ireland divided? How do these compare to divisions that exist between people and political parties in your country?–What efforts for peace in Northern Ireland have been made in the past, and how have they been effective or ineffective?–What are the goals of the Northern Ireland Assembly? What additional goals do you think they should have, and why?–What do you think the cabinet members in the Northern Ireland Assembly should try to do with regard to unifying the country? Why do some of the cabinet members not want this as the final result of the assembly?–What other examples, historic and current, exist with regard to countries being divided on the basis of religious differences? What actions have people on the different sides often taken in these situations? What resolution do you think there could be to bring together people of different religions?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on participation in class discussions, group research and presentation of a party in the Northern Ireland Assembly, and a research-based press statement from the perspective of one of the assembly’s cabinet members about his or her background and views.Vocabulary:parliament, negotiators, deadlock, guerrilla, disarmament, ministers, hallmark, enormity, converting, cohabiting, deputy, thwart, republicans, nationalists, collective, adjournment, stalemate, rescind, combative, presiding, reconvene, paramilitaryExtension Activities:1. Organize a meeting of the Northern Ireland Assembly (members played by students), in which key issues in Ireland today are discussed and debated from the perspectives of the cabinet members researched in class. Try to host one of these meetings prior to an actual meeting of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and compare your meeting’s results to the real results.2. Follow news coverage of the Northern Ireland Assembly cabinet member researched for homework. How does this member contribute to the Northern Ireland Assembly? How does the public view him or her? What stances does he or she take with regard to political, social and economic matters in Northern Ireland?3. Compare New York Times coverage of this historic development in the Irish peace process to its coverage in Irish newspapers. Visit Ecola Newsstand (//www.ecola.com) to access English-language newspapers and magazines from Ireland and around the world, and explore how the Web sites of the four political parties involved in the Northern Ireland Assembly present current events related to the cabinet’s decisions.4. Design a flag that might appropriately represent the Northern Ireland Assembly and the attempt to unify the four historically divided parties involved.5. Explore grassroots efforts at peace in Northern Ireland, including the works of Nobel Peace Prize winners John Hume and David Trimble (1998) and Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan (1976).6. Learn about how the Northern Ireland Assembly will work. How the Assembly Will Work (//news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk_politics/newsid_307000/307585.stm) is a sketch from the BBC of how a Northern Ireland Assembly could work. Compare this sketch to what actually evolves as the way in which this new body functions.7. Create a timeline of the history of the Irish Republican Army, including its impending disarmament in May 2000.8. Analyze the Good Friday Agreement and its role in the Irish peace process.9. Working in groups, research major events and cultural changes in Irish history: The Early Period (circa 400- circa 1100), The Anglo-Norman Period (circa 1100- circa 1400), The Period of English Supremacy (circa 1400- circa 1650), The Revolutionary Period (circa 1650- circa 1800), and Modern Ireland (circa 1800-today).10. Research other historic and current situations in which countries are divided along religious lines. What are the issues on both sides of the situation? What actions have people on the different sides taken against their “enemies”? What past attempts at unifying this country have occurred, and in what ways have they been successful or unsuccessful? What resolution do you think there could be to bring together people of different religions in this country?Interdisciplinary Connections:American History- Research the influx of Irish immigrants to the United States beginning in the 19th century. What brought Irish immigrants to the United States? What challenges did they face in their new land?Fine Arts- Create a gallery of Irish art (visual art, dance, music and writing) in your classroom or school. For each “item” in your gallery, include a brief description on an index card indicating the name and creator of the piece of art, the time period in which it was created, and the significance of this piece of art to understanding Irish culture, political climate or national identity. Invite other classes to tour your gallery.Geography- Create an illustrated guidebook of symbols common to Irish folklore, such as leprechauns, shamrocks and Gaelic knots, as well as the origins of Irish holidays. You may also want to include Irish folklore and traditions in your book.Language Arts- Read works by Irish authors and poets, and examine how their works reflect political struggles and a sense of national identity in Ireland.Media Studies- Examine how Irish characters are presented in movies and on television. How do actors depicting Irish people act, look, and interact? Would you consider any of these presentations of characters to be stereotypes, and why?Other Information on the Web:The Search for Peace (//news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/northern_ireland/understanding/default.stm) is a BBC site that takes an in-depth look at the struggle for peace in Northern Ireland, with an historical archive of audio and video testimonials.Irish History on the Web (//wwwvms.utexas.edu/~jdana/irehist.html) includes Irish Studies, history of the famine, Northern Ireland, unionist history, timelines and more.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8World History Standard 44- Understands the search for community, stability, and peace in an interdependent world.

1676	 2009	a	I’ve officially enrolled at Rutgers University, though as I mentioned in my last post I could get news to change my decision as late as July.In response to some of the comments on my last post I wanted to reiterate one point: while I had my disappointments with my decision being largely dictated by finances, I am happy with my choice and do not at all, as one comment implied, feel superior to other Rutgers students.I’ve visited and met many smart and motivated students and would be happy to join them. I also wanted to clarify that while Princeton and other Ivies do pledge to cover full need, so does Vassar. Even so, because of my specific financial situation (parents income is eligible, but they are asset-heavy due to being close to retirement) my need-based aid was lacking there, and would probably be similar at the Ivies. I’ll have to see, if the time comes.For juniors applying to college now, I’d suggest clearly discussing financial situations. I wasn’t completely aware of what my family could afford until late in the process. I’d suggest checking an EFC (Expected Family Contribution) Calculator. Colleges that pledge to cover need base this on your EFC; if it’s high, and you still need money, you might want to apply to schools that offer large merit scholarships (like Rutgers).Also, remember that not all schools pledge to cover all need. Schools like N.Y.U. grant as much aid as they see fit, but it probably won’t cover everything. Also, grades play into merit aid, so if they’re lacking, apply to schools that give aid based on need. Where you’ll get the most money depends on your personal circumstances. If you know you won’t have enough money, try for private scholarships to make it work.One thing I was really happy about in my college process was the wide range of schools I applied to. I applied to many schools, so I was able to really look into all their programs and see what I liked. Moreover, all the schools I applied to in the first place were places I could see myself going and enjoying, so when the decision ended up being mainly financially based, I wasn’t extremely disappointed.I’d like to wish all those applying to college next year good luck in the process, and to everyone finishing the process as I am — we did it, we are officially the college class of 2013.Accepted To Waiting For Rejected From Rutgers University Princeton University (waiting list) Swarthmore College The College of New Jersey University of Pennsylvania (waiting list) New York University Columbia University (waiting list) Drew University Haverford College (waiting list) Vassar College“The Envelope, Please” is a series of posts by high school seniors chronicling their experiences during the end-game of this year’s college admissions process.
456	 2016	a	Name Johan LindebergAge 59Occupation Founder and creative consultant, J. Lindeberg; photographerLocation Williamsburg, BrooklynFavorite Room The living room of his rental house, which has green-gray walls and a Vladimir Kagan sofa where the Swedish-born clothing designer, who recently returned to his namesake brand, J. Lindeberg, does his best work. “I don’t like to sit behind a desk — it blocks my mind and my creativity,” Mr. Lindeberg said. “For me, a sofa is the center point.”This room, with its dark walls and collection of skull masks, feels very masculine. Do you live alone? I think it feels French chic. But I separated from my partner a year and a half ago. I’d been living in SoHo for many years. I was kind of tired of traffic and people. I changed my environment, moved to Williamsburg. It’s a very calm street. I always like dark walls. It makes it somehow tighter and homier.You’re known as a partygoer and a night owl. How much time do you actually spend at home? I actually changed in the last year. I used to be out a lot in New York. Since I moved here after a separation, I decided to spend a lot of time at home and think and ground myself and find inspiration on a new level. So the house has been very important to me the last year and a half.

5398	 1987	a	The Feld Ballet will be presenting its first ballet by George Balanchine - the high-spirited ''Tarantella'' - during the company's two-week spring season, which begins Tuesday at the Joyce Theater. And there will be a new work by Carolyn Carlson, the former Alwin Nikolais dancer who currently directs her own dance company in Paris. But for Feld fans, the highlight of the season promises to be the revival of his ''Tzaddik,'' created in 1974 and last seen in New York 10 years ago. Performed to Aaron Copland's ''Vitebsk,'' the dance is one of Eliot Feld's richest works, drawing on the choreographer's memories of the rituals he watched as a child in synagogue.Daniel McCusker left New York in 1985 to direct the Ram Island Dance Company of Portland, Me. He returns for a rare New York engagement, opening on Friday for three performances at St. Mark's Church. A former member of the Lucinda Childs Dance Company, Mr. McCusker makes pieces that seem to be a matter of luminous abstract dance. But they shimmer with poignant subtexts, conjuring images of lives and the places and times they were lived.''Vantage Points,'' a new work set to music by David Friedman, doesn't sound like an exception. The program will be completed by ''Story,'' an atmospheric dance with a breakneck solo for the choreographer.Pina Bausch will likely always be a controversial figure in American dance. For those who wish to add a little light to the heat, there is a slide-lecture, ''An Exploration of the New Esthetic: The Magnetic German Tanztheater,'' presented by Claudia Jeschke. Highlights and current trends in German neo-Expressionist theater and dance will be explored in the free lecture, sponsored by Goethe House New York and the Dance Collection Performing Arts Research Collection, Monday at 6 P.M. at the Bruno Walter Auditorium, Library of the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center.
5318	 1988	a	Even the candy dishes are filled: M & M's are piled on majolica cake stands, antique glass canisters are stocked with miniature candy bars and a copper lusterware tea set is filled with saltwater taffy.''The Pantzers wanted chintz and antiques and porcelain and all the twinkle,'' Mrs. Kravis said. ''We wanted restraint and all of the above. The idea was for people to come into the house and feel welcome, but not overwhelmed.''The prescription given the decorators was not easy, considering the size of the peaked-roof house. It has a living room 37 feet long and 28 feet wide; a wide, columned terrace, and a formal paneled dining room. The house, according to Mrs. Kravis, was ''so big that it swallowed up everything.''That meant a lot of interior decorating in a short time.During Christmas week, the decorators selected and reserved fabrics. ''Carrying floor plans of the house,'' Mrs. Kravis added, ''Ellie and I went on our hands and knees to our tradespeople'' to entreat them to deliver finished upholstery in time.In the first week of January, Mrs. Kravis recalled, they walked around the house and grounds, donning sunglasses and sun hats and pretending it was summer. ''We imagined the landscaping and the not-yet-built tennis court,'' she said, ''and thought what it might be like to walk through the house and out to play tennis.''Soon the budget had to be increased. ''The first budget was with the idea of furnishing the house with pine furniture,'' Mrs. Kravis recalled. ''But the house was so serious and the scale of the architecture so enormous, we knew that would never do.''Monogrammed and embroidered linens were ordered, too: bed, bath, table, pool and cocktail linens.The Pantzers had to decide quickly on fabrics and furnishings. ''Everything we showed them had to be in stock,'' Mrs. Kravis said.

2293	 2006	a	Less than two minutes before, the Texas A&M kicker Layne Neumann connected on a go-ahead 32-yard field goal.Texas Tech (4-1) has now won five of its last six games against Texas A&M (4-1)."The character that it takes to engineer a comeback like this is big," Texas Tech Coach Mike Leach said. "It's very gratifying."Harrell completed 32 of 45 passes for 392 yards and 4 touchdowns, three of which were to Johnson. During the game-winning drive, he was 5 of 7 for 75 yards and Texas Tech had a fourth-down conversion inside its 40-yard line.On his last touchdown, Harrell said he recognized the blitz and called an audible for Johnson to run a streak pattern instead of a slant."Graham was calm out there the whole time," Johnson said. "He reminds me of Tom Brady."The Aggies' last-minute meltdown Saturday is likely to turn up the heat on Franchione, who is paid an annual salary of $2 million. He is a woeful 1-3 versus the Red Raiders, an unacceptable mark for a football-rich school that considers Texas its biggest rival and that expects to be a national power."This game is not the end to all wherewithal whether we had won the game or lost the game," Franchione said. "There's more critical important games to play."On a sun-baked day in which temperatures hovered near 90 degrees, the Aggie defense reverted back to old habits Saturday under first-year defensive coordinator Gary Darnell.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The Red Raiders feasted, rolling up 297 of their 433 offensive yards in the first half for a 24-14 halftime lead.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyYet until Saturday's last-minute collapse, the Aggies played better defensively in the second half, allowing them to rally behind a ground attack that compiled 250 yards.Of that, sophomore Jorvorskie Lane pounded out 77 yards and a touchdown on 12 carries.Texas A&M tied the game at 24-24 on a 4-yard run by the junior fullback Chris Alexander with 8:44 left. The Aggies then grabbed the lead on Neumann's second field goal, but then came Texas Tech's late heroics."We had a maximum blitz and someone failed to make it maximum," said Darnell of the game-winning play.The epitome of college football's hot coach when he arrived at Texas A&M in December 2002, Franchione has thus far been unable to replicate his makeover magic in previous stops at Alabama, Texas Christian and New Mexico.The Aggies are 20-20 during his four-year tenure and have advanced to the postseason only once. R.C. Slocum, whom Franchione replaced, was 21-15 in his last three years and led Texas A&M to bowl appearances in each of those seasons.Although Texas A&M entered Saturday undefeated, its record was somewhat misleading.Its four victories have come against teams that entering Saturday were a combined 6-11 this season. One of those wins included stopping Army just short of the end zone on the game's final play to escape with a 28-24 win.Nearly an hour after Saturday's game, the final score remained on some of Kyle Field's scoreboards as jubilant Texas Tech fans congregated near the Red Raider locker room.The Aggies must still play Oklahoma, Nebraska and at Texas.Although Franchione wouldn't admit it, Saturday's loss was clearly a setback for him and A&M."It's tough," he said.
521	 2016	a	But the problem comes in with that one word, “try.”Set aside for a moment Trump’s low character, his penchant for inflaming racial tensions, his personal corruptions. Assume for the sake of argument that all that can be folded into a “lesser of two evils” case.What remains is this question: Can Donald Trump actually execute the basic duties of the presidency? Is there any way that his administration won’t be a flaming train wreck from the start? Is there any possibility that he’ll be levelheaded in a crisis — be it another 9/11 or financial meltdown, or any of the lesser-but-still-severe challenges that presidents reliably face?I think we have seen enough from his campaign — up to and including his wretchedly stupid conduct since the first debate — to answer confidently, “No.” Trump’s zest for self-sabotage, his wild swings, his inability to delegate or take advice, are not mere flaws; they are defining characteristics. The burdens of the presidency will leave him permanently maddened, perpetually undone.Even if that undoing doesn’t lead to economic or geopolitical calamity (yes, Virginia, there are worse things than the Iraq War), which cause or idea associated with Trumpism is likely to emerge stronger after a four-year train wreck? Not populism or immigration restrictionism. Not evangelical Christianity. Not economic conservatism. They’ll all be lashed to the mast of a burning ship whose captain is angrily tweeting from the poop deck.Months ago, I worried that Trump was too authoritarian to be entrusted with the presidency. That worry has receded a bit, because authoritarianism requires a ruthless sort of competence that Trump cannot attain.But fecklessness in the presidency can be as destructive as malice, and not just to the country: A disastrous chief executive can do devastating damage to his own political ideas.In this sense the intellectuals’ case for Donald Trump fails because it cannot shake free of those ideas and see the personal element here clearly.What Trump believes, what he intends to do in office — those questions are ultimately secondary to the problem of the man himself, and the near-certainty that he will fail, and in failing, betray anyone who has lent him their support.
387	 2016	a	PhotoHillary Clinton’s presidential campaign raised $37 million in the three-month period that ended Dec. 31, filling the war chest of a campaign that has pulled in more than $112 million overall for the Democratic contest, her campaign said Friday.The campaign spent $74 million of that money in 2015 as it established a ground operation in states beyond the four early nominating contests, and it invested heavily in Iowa and New Hampshire, where Mrs. Clinton’s main Democratic rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, has strong support.“We are now heading into Iowa and New Hampshire with the resources we need to be successful,” Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager, said in a statement announcing the figures.Mr. Sanders, who has rejected the support of a “super PAC,” amassed an army of small-dollar donations in raising about $26.2 million in the previous quarter, when Mrs. Clinton raised $29.9 million. The Sanders campaign has not yet released its fourth-quarter figures.Mrs. Clinton relies more heavily on larger donations. She has spent months crisscrossing the country to attend fund-raising events that bring in up to $2,700, the maximum donation allowed for the nominating contest. But her campaign has received a wave of smaller donations, particularly after Mrs. Clinton’s testimony before the Benghazi committee in Congress and following her debate performances, aides said.The campaign declined to say what percentage of the $37 million it brought in the fourth quarter came from small contributions.In a sign that the Clinton operation is also looking past the nominating contest, the campaign said that while it was only soliciting donations for the primaries, it had also raised $1 million in donations to be used in the general election.Mrs. Clinton also raised more than $18 million for the Democratic National Committee and state parties throughout the country where Democrats at the state level have suffered losses.Two of the Republican candidates, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ben Carson, have released their fund-raising totals for the quarter, with Mr. Cruz raising $20 million, a two-thirds increase over his previous quarter, and Mr. Carson raising $23 million.

4483	 1993	a	There was so much talking between Ray Mercer and Jesse Ferguson in their Feb. 6 bout at Madison Square Garden that George Foreman, Larry Merchant and Jim Lampley, the HBO announcers, began to joke about the jawing.Foreman, Merchant and Lampley were commenting on the fight in a warmup that was not for general broadcast. At one point, after Mercer had again spoken to Ferguson during a clinch, Foreman quipped, "I think he just made him an offer to quit."That is apparently what a grand jury believed, too. Mercer, 32 years old, was indicted on a sports bribery charge, arrested in Indianapolis on Sunday night and arraigned on the felony charge Tuesday in Manhattan. He pleaded not guilty.District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau contended that Mercer could be heard "repeatedly" on the tapes offering Ferguson a bribe to throw the fight. The district attorney said that Mercer had mentioned $100,000. Mercer, who lost the 10-round fight, had been guaranteed a title shot against Bowe, worth at least $1.5 million, if he were to defeat Ferguson.
3774	 1997	a	After two years of criticism from Federal environmental officials, Gov. George E. Pataki has announced plans to strengthen New York State's enforcement of environmental laws, particularly those limiting air pollution from large sources like factories and power plants.The biggest shift would be an increase in inspections for pollution problems and a new emphasis on pursuing the worst violators. Those two factors were identified by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency as particularly weak in New York State last year.Senior E.P.A. officials said Mr. Pataki's planned changes could end a long decline in environmental enforcement in New York that began late in the administration of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and worsened under Mr. Pataki. Some private environmental groups and political opponents were less optimistic.A low point was reached last year, according to the E.P.A.'s continuing analysis of the state's programs. The Federal analysis concluded that fines were consistently too low, inspections were far too few, and the pursuit of big companies discharging hundreds of tons of pollutants into the air was ''minimal.''

3778	 1997	a	New Jersey's poorest city, Camden, may need more oversight from state officials, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said yesterday. The Governor said that she would not recommend a state takeover but might seek legislation to give her administration a greater hand in Camden's financial affairs. The fiscal year is more than half over, Camden has yet to approve its budget and the state has had to give the city an extra $8.3 million to help with its $11 million deficit, said Christopher B. Wolf, a spokesman for the State Department of Community Affairs.Mayor Arnold W. Webster said he welcomed financial assistance from the state, but he criticized state officials for failing to cooperate with his administration in solving the city's financial problems.

5645	 1986	a	To the Editor:While I'm sure Dr. Stephen G. Baum's medical credentials are impeccable, he must be aware that he exhibits certain nonprofessional prejudices in his statement that the common denominator in the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome has been promiscuity (letter, Oct. 21). Certainly it contributes; promiscuity also increases your chance of getting other diseases, including the common cold.It was a loaded statement tantamount to saying that those who get AIDS deserve it for their life style. My layman's knowledge of the disease is that it is contracted by a virus entering the bloodstream. Are hemophiliac children who are unfortunate enough to receive tainted blood transfusions promiscuous? Can Dr. Baum state categorically that the disease could never be contracted via one exposure, or that a person having sex two times a year might unluckily choose the wrong partners?I fully concur that AIDS education should be a part of sex education and that promiscuity will increase the risk of contracting contagious and infectious diseases. But indirectly labeling AIDS victims as promiscuous is unfortunate and certainly inaccurate. CHARLES ALMON Brooklyn, Oct. 22, 1986

4681	 1992	a	Anne G. Wilder, who led the expansion of Playwrights Horizons, a nonprofit developmental theater in Manhattan, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 63 years old and lived in Manhattan.She died of a heart attack, her family said.Mrs. Wilder joined the Playwrights Horizons board in 1976 and was its chairwoman for the last 11 years. She helped raise money and guide the purchase of its building at 416 West 42d Street, which houses two theaters and administrative offices.The organization sponsored many productions, some of which moved to Off Broadway, including Christopher Durang's "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You," Jonathan Reynolds's "Geniuses" and Wendy Wasserstein's "Isn't It Romantic."Among the writers, composers and lyricists supported by Playwrights Horizons have been Ted Tally, A. R. Gurney, Alfred Uhry, James Lapine, William Finn and Albert Innaurato.
2847	 2003	a	The government's economic report on Thursday showing a surge in business investment in computers and software came as no surprise to the team at Reel FX Creative Studios, a producer of special effects for television commercials and movie studios.This year, it has purchased 80 new machines that render the computer-generated images that are the company's products -- ranging from the brightly colored droplets of sweat trickling off athletes in Gatorade ads to the fires, explosions and dust storms in ''Saving Jessica Lynch,'' a docudrama scheduled for broadcast on NBC tomorrow night.This new low-cost hardware and software has helped Reel FX, based in Dallas, save money and take on new work, too, encouraging its decision makers to add another 80 computers by year-end. ''It all adds up to dollars and new opportunities,'' explained Chuck Peil, executive director of business development for Reel FX.Business investment in technology is finally picking up across much of the American economy. Consumer spending, lifted by tax cuts and a home mortgage refinancing boom, was the primary reason the economy grew at its fastest rate since 1984 during the three months ended in September. Yet business spending on information technology -- computer hardware, software and services -- increased at an annual rate of more than 15 percent. This, in fact, was the second consecutive quarter of encouraging growth for information technology investment, which also rose more than 15 percent in the three months ended in June.

5203	 1988	a	Why India? Why does this distant, stiflingly crowded, quarrelsome country, still ridden with wrenching poverty for hundreds of millions and still unable to free itself of murder and hatred among castes and religions, mean so much to the United States - or why should it?Why does it mean so much to me? Long ago I lived here as a correspondent; it was the center of my world. I have lived in other countries and while they remain in mind they become part of my past. Only India still seizes me so, emotionally and intellectually, so long afterward. I keep thinking about India, keep coming back, I and those other Americans who felt the pull of India and will for the rest of our lives.For 30 years I have been trying to explain this to friends, and to myself. It seems a good time, the beginning of a new year, a time of re-examination, to return to India.I came to find out what India was like, after four years of absence. Mostly, though, I wanted to figure out whether the idea that India was still important to my country and my life was just romanticism and sentimentality arising out of what India had been, and I had been, or had meaning.

2379	 2005	a	Some restaurants stand at unusual culinary crossroads. Metropol stands at an unusual cartographical one.It faces the intersection of two numbered streets that sound to the uninitiated as if they should be parallel to each other and about a quarter mile apart. But West Fourth and West 10th do indeed meet, an asterisklike exception to Manhattan's usually tidy grid, an anomaly that happens to be Metropol's address.The restaurant itself represents a more typical convergence.It's part bistro, part brasserie, those terms and genres being so thoroughly confused and conflated in New York these days. Globe-shaped lighting fixtures dangle from a pressed tin ceiling. A distressed mirror dominates one broad wall.To those vintage flourishes Metropol weds the semiotics of a certain kind and era of downtown Manhattan cool. There are enormous black-and-white photographs of Edie Sedgwick, Andy Warhol, Nico. There's a thick cover of darkness.

2498	 2005	a	Reader responses to Marjane Satrapi’s post “Defending My Country.”Taraneh Kayhani Ferdman, San Juan, Puerto Rico: Just want to congratulate you on your clever message, your balanced view on life and, of course, your striking illustrations! You make us all Iranian-born women and men very proud to have your voice heard in The New York Times.Sylvia Notini, Bologna, Italy: As an American who teaches English at the University of Bologna, I know a lot about defending Americans who are patriotic and against the war at the same time. It is hard for me to find a way to tell my students that I am just as horrified as they are by many of the bad things that Europeans read about Americans — that some Americans condone torture, that a presidential election can be questionable, that some people can believe that saying “freedom fries” instead of “French fries” will help make the world a better place. So I am grateful to The New York Times online for having allowed me to discover Marjane Satrapi, whose columns I can bring to class, not only to help me teach English, but also, and above all, to send a message to my students about the country I love.Ken Hudson: I’m an American who served honorably and proudly for one year in Iraq. I came to know, appreciate, admire and even fell in love with Iraqi people. I reject your assertion that we imposed democracy by bombing the Iraqi people. The bombing that did take place was strategic and precise and it killed bad people who deserved to die. The world is a better place because of many of the evil people killed by American bombs. Saddam Hussein is on trial for crimes against humanity, [his sons] Uday and Qusay are DEAD and there are no more rape and torture chambers under the sanction of Iraq’s government.Elodie Sutton, Washington: As a French-American, I often find myself having to defend either culture to friends and even family from both sides of the pond. Thank you for capturing and illustrating so eloquently the issues at hand. I think every American should read your article.Beverly Tan, Miami: Cheers, Ms. Satrapi! Your illustrations are fabulous, as always, and the piece really resonated with me. Like you, I sometimes feel as if I am caught in a crossfire of rhetoric. I am ethnically Chinese, and the Bush administration has been particularly vociferous in deeming China a hotbed for human rights violations. Simultaneously, this same administration is wantonly bombing Iraq into oblivion to install a democratic government — whose actual goal is to guarantee the United States a steady supply of cheap gas. My hope is that other readers in the global community will understand that not every American is of the Freedom Fry variety. Many of us have tirelessly campaigned against Bush’s policies, and have been incensed and embarrassed to watch this so-called leader blunder his way through delicate international protocol. This is not the America that our forefathers fought for. Bush is not the leader that I chose, and he does not speak for me, just as he does not speak for many other Americans.Maria, New York: I must admit that until I read “Persepolis,” I too thought that Iran was a mysterious country full of mysterious and very grumpy people. But you showed me that indeed Iranians are people very similar to Americans in that they love their country and are either in agreement with the regime in power or are very saddened to see their country run into the ground. We do not, however, have to endure the pain of not being able to make our lives at home. That is a tragedy and I sincerely hope that one day that will change.Judy Parker, New York: Right on, Marjane! The number of us against this stupid president’s policies and black/white thinking are growing. If only our government will grow with us . . . meanwhile, please keep spreading the word that there are many of us independent, non Bible-belt thinkers in the U.S.Mona, Boston: Thank you for a funny but so true story. I was born in Iran, grew up in Paris and now live in Boston. In the United States I often hear people say they don’t like us over there — meaning France. When in France, I have to tell many times the story of the warm and caring hug I got from an old man, George, on 9/11 in Boston, because we were both in tears. It takes a lot of effort to defend three countries. From now on, I will just travel with your cartoon in my back pocket. Merci!Steve Denes, New York: What a wonderfully clear and concise statement Ms. Satrapi makes about defending “the other.” When I worked in Nigeria I had to explain Americans to Nigerians; now I have to explain Nigerians. Because I was born in Hungary I have to do the same and vice versa. Because I worked in East Harlem as a white man, I had to explain that, and vice versa. Because I married someone of another faith I explain that as well. I never see this as an obligation but rather as an opportunity and luxury. I think Ms. Satrapi would agree.Ahmad Ramsheyi, Paris: As an Iranian educated in the United States and living in France, I share Majane Satrapi’s point of views on Bush’s shameful war on humanity. American people are wonderful people but a lot too naïve — to the point of putting their trust in the hands of crooked politicians who care only for themselves and tell people lies. Thank you, Ms. Satrapi. We need you.Julie Nauman, Paris: As an American living in Paris, who has also lived in the Muslim world, all I can say to you is, thanks. I also find myself defending France, Muslims and, of course, the United States. We are diplomats of the world! If only I could do it with your charming drawings.
2746	 2003	a	Farmers expect to expand the planting of genetically modified crops in the United States this year, according to the results of a survey of farmers' intentions released yesterday by the Agriculture Department.The survey, however, indicated that farmers are shying away a bit from crops resistant to Monsanto's Roundup herbicide, other than soybeans. The survey found that herbicide-resistant cotton would decline to 54 percent this year from 58 percent of total cotton acreage last year. Herbicide-resistant corn would increase only to 12 percent of acreage from 11 percent, it predicted. The herbicide-resistant category includes brands besides those made by Monsanto, but its Roundup-ready class accounts for most of them.It is not clear if the slowdown is a reaction to recent concerns that widespread use of Roundup-ready crops are causing some weeds to become resistant to the herbicide.A Monsanto spokeswoman said that the company's sales figures indicated that use of Roundup-ready corn and cotton was still growing.

3457	 1999	a	America's economic boom -- already the second longest on record -- shows no signs of flagging.Despite a decline in auto production and another sharp deterioration in the trade balance, the United States economy grew at a surprisingly robust 4.5 percent annual rate during the first quarter of 1999, the Government reported yesterday.That is the sort of heady pace usually associated with the first, not the ninth, year of an economic expansion. Moreover, most forecasters, including those at the Federal Reserve, had been expecting a visible slowdown from the previous quarter's frenetic 6 percent rate.''This economy continues to defy the aging process,'' said Bill Cheney, chief economist at the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company in Boston. ''The only discernible weakness is the trade deficit. And this has merely slowed the economy from warp speed.''A burst of domestic spending fueled last quarter's gains. Consumers, who account for more than two-thirds of the nation's buying, spent at the fastest pace in more than a decade. Home purchases shot up at an annual rate above 15 percent. And business investment in new plant and equipment, which had faltered last summer, continued to rebound, advancing at a 7.6 percent rate.
4334	 1994	a	It wasn't supposed to be a contest, but "A Keyboard Summit," a convocation of acoustic jazz pianists and electric organists at Town Hall on Wednesday evening, felt like a competition to discover which keyboard is the more legitimate jazz instrument. The JVC Jazz Festival concert gave preferential billing to the organ by featuring it in the second half, but when it came to making music of emotional substance and formal elegance, the piano won hands down.Each part of the evening brought together musicians with strong generational and regional ties. Roland Hanna and Barry Harris, who were featured in the piano segment, are both in their 60's and come from Detroit. Shirley Scott and Jimmy McGriff, the organists who dominated the second part, are in their late 50's and were born in Philadelphia.Mr. Hanna and Mr. Harris share a far-sighted vision of the jazz piano that encompasses be-bop, traditional blues and more romantic European influences. Mr. Hanna, the more lyrically inclined of the two, opened the evening with an ornate Gershwin esque fantasia built around the song "Yesterdays." Mr. Harris's solos were more playful and included a slowed-up, dreamy interpretation of the theme song from "I Love Lucy."Sitting face to face and playing duets on matching nine-foot grand pianos, the two pianists found a rapport so natural that it was often impossible to determine where one left off and the other began. Their collaboration culminated in a blues improvisation in which both musicians stressed their pianos' middle range.
3772	 1997	a	Challenging OrthodoxiesIn an Evening of BeethovenOrchestra of St. LukeCarnegie HallIt takes a combination of conviction and fortitude to offer an all-Beethoven concert at a time when programs devoted wholly to standard repertory are increasingly criticized as unimaginative. Andre Previn tilted at that windmill on Wednesday when he led the Orchestra of St. Luke's in a Beethoven evening. He also challenged another orthodoxy, the belief that a composer's instrumentation and sense of scale are sacrosanct. His centerpiece was a string orchestra expansion of the String Quartet No. 14, with basses doubling the cello line and with dynamics and tempos that reflected the ensemble's heft.Tradeoffs were inevitable. A composer writing for a string quartet expects a nimbleness and clarity that it would not be reasonable to expect from an orchestra, not only because the move from single to multiple strings courts ensemble problems, but also because of the different ways a quartet and an orchestra interact with an acoustic space. The Orchestra of St. Luke's played with extroardinary unity, yet there were times, particularly in the Presto, when a listener craved the sharper focus a quartet affords.Still, it was not lost on Mr. Previn that Beethoven's slow movements magnify well, and in the Adagio and Andante movements, he drew from his players a Stokowskian lushness and grandeur. Earlier, Mr. Previn was more circumspect. Except for its punctuating chordal bursts, his account of the ''Coriolan'' Overture subordinated drama and electricity to surface sheen. In the Fourth Piano Concerto, Mr. Previn and his soloist, Horacio Gutierrez, presented a refined, patrician reading that worked magnificently in the slow movement, but elsewhere lacked the provocative edge that makes Beethoven Beethoven.

7466	 1964	a	CHICAGO, June 30 — Gov‐ ernor William W. Scranton said today that the Republican voters of Illinois supported his candidacy for the Presidential nomination even if their convention delegates did not. He expected, he said, that some of the delegates would recog‐nize that fact by convention time. July 13.The Pennsylvania Governor, at a news conference, said that the Nielson Poll, an established organization, had found that 65 per cent of the Illinois Republicans favored him, and that 35 per cent supported Sentor Barry Goldwater.Mr. Scranton's news conference took place before the Illinois delegation announced that 48 of its 58 members had committed themselves to Mr. Goldwater, with none for Mr. Scranton.The Governor, however, had been prepared for the blow. He was asked whether he would be surprised, or shocked, if the delegation indicated 48 or more for his rival.
1736	 2009	a	Dan Saelinger/Getty ImagesSeveral years ago, David Nieman set out to study racers at the Western States Endurance Run, a 100-mile test of human stamina held annually in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. The race directors had asked Nieman, a well-regarded physiologist and director of the Human Performance Laboratory at the North Carolina Research Campus, to look at the stresses that the race places on the bodies of participants. Nieman and the race authorities had anticipated that the rigorous distance and altitude would affect runners’ immune systems and muscles, and they did. But one of Nieman’s other findings surprised everyone.After looking at racers’ blood work, he determined that some of the ultramarathoners were supplying their own physiological stress, in tablet form. Those runners who’d popped over-the-counter ibuprofen pills before and during the race displayed significantly more inflammation and other markers of high immune system response afterward than the runners who hadn’t taken anti-inflammatories. The ibuprofen users also showed signs of mild kidney impairment and, both before and after the race, of low-level endotoxemia, a condition in which bacteria leak from the colon into the bloodstream.These findings were “disturbing,” Nieman says, especially since “this wasn’t a minority of the racers.” Seven out of ten of the runners were using ibuprofen before and, in most cases, at regular intervals throughout the race, he says. “There was widespread use and very little understanding of the consequences.”Athletes at all levels and in a wide variety of sports swear by their painkillers. A study published earlier this month on the website of the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that, at the 2008 Ironman Triathlon in Brazil, almost 60 percent of the racers reported using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory painkillers (or NSAIDs, which include ibuprofen) at some point in the three months before the event, with almost half downing pills during the race itself. In another study, about 13 percent of participants in a 2002 marathon in New Zealand had popped NSAIDs before the race. A study of professional Italian soccer players found that 86 percent used anti-inflammatories during the 2002-2003 season.A wider-ranging look at all of the legal substances prescribed to players during the 2002 and 2006 Men’s World Cup tournaments worldwide found that more than half of these elite players were taking NSAIDS at least once during the tournament, with more than 10 percent using them before every match.“For a lot of athletes, taking painkillers has become a ritual,” says Stuart Warden, an assistant professor and director of physical therapy research at Indiana University, who has extensively studied the physiological impacts of the drugs. “They put on their uniform” or pull on their running shoes and pop a few Advil. “It’s like candy” or Vitamin I, as some athletes refer to ibuprofen.Why are so many active people swallowing so many painkillers?One of the most common reasons cited by the triathletes in Brazil was “pain prevention.” Similarly, when the Western States runners were polled, most told the researchers that “they thought ibuprofen would get them through the pain and discomfort of the race,” Nieman says, “and would prevent soreness afterward.” But the latest research into the physiological effects of ibuprofen and other NSAIDs suggests that the drugs in fact, have the opposite effect. In a number of studies conducted both in the field and in human performance laboratories in recent years, NSAIDs did not lessen people’s perception of pain during activity or decrease muscle soreness later. “We had researchers at water stops” during the Western States event, Nieman says, asking the racers how the hours of exertion felt to them. “There was no difference between the runners using ibuprofen and those who weren’t. So the painkillers were not useful for reducing pain” during the long race, he says, and afterward, the runners using ibuprofen reported having legs that were just as sore as those who hadn’t used the drugs.Moreover, Warden and other researchers have found that, in laboratory experiments on animal tissues, NSAIDs actually slowed the healing of injured muscles, tendons, ligament, and bones. “NSAIDs work by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins,”substances that are involved in pain and also in the creation of collagen, Warden says. Collagen is the building block of most tissues. So fewer prostaglandins mean less collagen, “which inhibits the healing of tissue and bone injuries,” Warden says, including the micro-tears and other trauma to muscles and tissues that can occur after any strenuous workout or race.The painkillers also blunt the body’s response to exercise at a deeper level. Normally, the stresses of exercise activate a particular molecular pathway that increases collagen, and leads, eventually, to creating denser bones and stronger tissues. If “you’re taking ibuprofen before every workout, you lessen this training response,” Warden says. Your bones don’t thicken and your tissues don’t strengthen as they should. They may be less able to withstand the next workout. In essence, the pills athletes take to reduce the chances that they’ll feel sore may increase the odds that they’ll wind up injured — and sore.All of which has researchers concerned. Warden wrote in an editorial this year on the website of the British Journal of Sports Medicine that “there is no indication or rationale for the current prophylactic use of NSAIDs by athletes, and such ritual use represents misuse.”When, then, are ibuprofen and other anti-inflammatory painkillers justified? “When you have inflammation and pain from an acute injury,” Warden says. “In that situation, NSAIDs are very effective.” But to take them “before every workout or match is a mistake.”
5771	 1985	a	FOR years, the identical Dunhill names created customer confusion, dismay and sheepish grins.Consumers who bought expensive suits at Dunhill Tailors at 65 East 57th Street in Manhattan would call Alfred Dunhill of London's store at 620 Fifth Avenue (50th Street) to find out whether their suits were ready. Sale days at either store frequently brought eager shoppers to the wrong one. And people who wanted a particular brand of English tobacco would call Dunhill Tailors instead of Alfred Dunhill.Now the problem is on the way to being solved.Dunhill Holdings, the parent company of Alfred Dunhill, has agreed to buy the business of Dunhill Tailors for $3.25 million in cash and will continue that 62-year-old business ''for the immediate future.'' The acquiring company will research the full operations of the clothing company to determine what ''the synergies are with our own apparel business and make any adjustments that are needed,'' Anthony A. Greener, managing director of Dunhill Holdings, said in an interview in New York.One similarity is obvious. Both stores are definitely in the luxury goods field.Ready-made men's suits at Dunhill Tailors range from $500 to $750, and custom-made garments start at $1,800. Alfred Dunhill, which several years ago diversified into apparel, offers blazer jackets at $650 and men's slacks from $85 to $100. Celebrities and the superaffluent frequent both. William S. Paley, the founder of the Columbia Broadcasting System, and Milton Berle have their own cigar cubicles in Alfred Dunhill's second-floor humidor. Paul Newman, the Rockefeller family and other luminaries buy their clothes at Dunhill Tailors.Founded in 1923 by William Block and his older son, Norman, as a retail clothing business on the fifth floor of 1 West 52d Street, Dunhill Tailors has operated for six decades under Norman Block, now 80 years old, and Leon Block, his 72-year old brother, who joined the company five years later. The single-store company has been at its 57th Street store since 1957. ''We're selling because of our age,'' observed Leon Block. ''We want to take things easier.''

2257	 2006	a	Essential operations, like the prisons, the state police, child protection services and mental hospitals, will continue to run during the shutdown. But roughly 36,000 of the state’s 80,000 employees were immediately furloughed under the order.The status of the state’s casinos remained unclear. Lawyers representing the casinos had gone to a state appellate court on Friday seeking a ruling that would allow them to remain open. But the court said that it had no jurisdiction to consider the request until after Mr. Corzine issued the shutdown order.The court was expected to take up the matter after Mr. Corzine signed the order and Stuart Rabner, the governor’s chief counsel, said that if a judge upheld Mr. Corzine’s request, casinos could close as soon as the morning after a ruling was issued.Mr. Corzine, a Democrat, said that he felt compelled to sign the order after he and the Democrat-controlled Legislature could not reach agreement on Mr. Corzine’s proposal to help balance the budget by raising the sales tax to 7 percent from 6 percent.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But a group of legislators, led by Assembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts Jr., opposed the new tax, arguing that the deficit could be filled with spending cuts and the expansion of existing taxes.And even in New Jersey, where politics can often be a contact sport, the vitriol that has surrounded the budget debate has been noteworthy. Earlier this week, a legislator had to break up a shoving match during a committee meeting and Mr. Corzine, in a bit of gamesmanship, ordered a cot for his office in a maneuver that aides said demonstrated his resolve to stay at the State House until he had a budget deal.Negotiations continued in an effort to meet a midnight deadline on Friday, but Mr. Corzine said today that talks had broken down between him and Mr. Roberts, with the sides having agreed on all but about $1 billion in spending cuts and revenue increases. Mr. Corzine has said that he believes the increase in the sales tax will generate about $1.1 billion.Going into this week’s discussions, New Jersey had missed the June 30 budget deadline three times in the past five years. But no governor has ever ordered a shutdown, according to the New Jersey Office of Legislative Services, the official research arm of the state Legislature.Advertisement Continue reading the main story“New Jersey has experienced budget delays before,” said David P. Rebovich, managing director of the Rider University Institute for New Jersey Politics. “But never a shutdown that will move forward and there may be political consequences.”Already Republican lawmakers have begun to seize on the issue. “The Democrats that run the Legislature had 101 days to enact the governor’s proposed budget, modify the budget that was provided to them, or propose one of their own,” said State Senator Robert E. Littell, a Republican from Sussex County, who was referring to the number of days since Mr. Corzine’s budget address on March 21. “Yet they have done neither. Instead, the have subjected the people of New Jersey to a State House version of the Mad Hatter’s Tea Party.”On Friday night, about two hours before the deadline, Mr. Roberts appealed to Mr. Corzine to abandon his plan to order the shutdown. He compared the prospect of a shutdown to legislators having “a gun placed to our head.”“We urge this governor to retreat from the precipice and not push the state over the edge into the uncharted waters of a government shutdown,” Mr. Roberts said.
3566	 1999	a	Most politicians try to sidestep issues that divide voters along militant, angry lines. But New York City's mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, firmly rejected that kind of evasion when asked about late-term abortions during a trip to Texas.The mayor said, with no apparent qualifier, that he did not plan to change his current position in favor of abortion rights to suit the leadership of New York's Conservative Party. Its chairman is calling on Mr. Giuliani to join other well-known Republicans in endorsing a ban on the late-term procedures that they refer to as partial birth abortions. But the mayor has steadfastly refused to alter his support of abortion rights. He did so again Monday in Texas in the company of Gov. George W. Bush, with whom he disagrees on this issue.What makes the mayor's stand particularly stalwart is that it could easily jeopardize his nomination by the Conservative Party of New York State. No Republican has won a statewide election in the last 25 years without the Conservative Party line on the ballot, a position that generally carries from 200,000 to 350,000 votes. If the expected race between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mr. Giuliani tightens, those votes would look even sweeter than they do already. The Conservative Party chairman, Michael Long, vows that he will not bargain on the issue. Mr. Long is even threatening to bring out an ''aggressive'' candidate to run on the Conservative line unless the mayor changes his mind and agrees to endorse a ban on late-term abortions. This extra candidate would surely siphon votes away from Mr. Giuliani and help Mrs. Clinton's chances.Once next year's Senate campaign is in full throttle, Mr. Long may view things differently. Mr. Giuliani may eventually make a courtesy visit to the Conservatives and try to persuade them to respect either his principled stand or, at least, the political realities. But the Giuliani camp said that his basic position would not be compromised, making this a case in which the mayor's stubborn streak is well deployed.
4509	 1993	a	But it wasn't the Smith failures that give the Yankees pause. It is the littany of their own near-misses and blown opportunities. So even while fretting about the starting pitching, they continued to search for alternatives to their bullpen woes. Last night, a 6 foot 6 inch, 270-pound one landed in their lap.So Big Lee Smith -- that's his unofficial monicker -- comes to the home of Rich Gossage and Sparky Lyle. Complete with 98-mile-an-hour fastball and the ability to strike someone, anyone out.Showalter also hopes for something more intangible. For he is a manager who looks to the force within players. And he what he knows of Smith is this. The right-hander is as physically imposing as Gossage, but he's also known to be as bulldoggish as Jeff Reardon, as durable as Rollie Fingers.Smith has never shirked an assignment, even on days when his ailing knees made it almost impossible to climb the dugout steps at Wrigley Field during his days with the Cubs. And he has never alibied after a failure. Not even when he yielded that now-famous home run to Steve Garvey in the 1984 National League playoffs, a shot that allowed the San Diego Padres to eventually crush the World Series dreams held by long-suffering Cubs fans.It is the combination of the man and the pitcher, the reputation and the record, which intrigue Showalter. The manager, who counts on head and heart and belly as much as New York's other manager, said as much before last night's 11-3 loss. Personality, presence counts, said the manager. Besides, joked Showalter, the Yankees might have to mix it up with a couple teams down the stretch in a physical strength. "I'd like to have a guy like Lee Smith out there in front," he laughed.That physical presence wasn't there every time out for St. Louis this season. Cardinals Manager Joe Torre probably wished he could keep the heart but jettison a couple years; those 12 blown saves made such a big difference for the now-fading Cardinals. But what wound up a mixed bag of disappointment and success in St. Louis looks overwhelmingly good to the Yankees. It couldn't help but, considering where the Yankees have been.To date, the entire Yankees' bullpen saved only 35, eight shy of Smith's totals. The best the Yankees had to offer, Steve Farr, has been more of a question than an answer, saving 25 but blowing six.
6261	 1973	a	PEKING, Sept. 30 (Reuters) —China's National Day celebrations marking the 24th anniversary of the establishment of the Communist government in Peking got under way officially tonight with a reception for 1,500 people in the glittering banquet hall of the capital's Great Hall of the People.On hand were Premier Chou En‐lai, Wang Hung‐wen, the 38‐year‐old former Shanghai worker who has shot to third place in the leadership, and Chairman Mao Tse‐tung's wife, Chiang Ching.There were no speeches at the reception, in keeping with the recent policy of a less formal celebration of National Day. The once obligatory national parade, which has been dropped since 1971, was again missing from this year's celebrations.But the Chinese capital was ablaze with lights as thosuands of people strolled and cycled around the vast Tienanmen Square.
3645	 1998	a	The investment, which would make Travelers the biggest shareholder in Nikko, shows how quickly national borders are breaking down in financial markets: even Japan, historically a protected market dominated almost exclusively by local brokerage firms, is now eager to embrace Wall Street investment and management.Under the agreement, Nikko would join with Salomon's Japanese business to create Nikko Salomon Smith Barney Ltd., a joint venture, into which Nikko would put its capital markets and international businesses. The new joint venture company's chief executive would be Toshiharu Kojima, the head of Salomon's business in Japan, and it would be 51 percent owned by Nikko and 49 percent by Salomon, with each firm contributing six board members, according to the executives involved in the negotiations.But Travelers through its investment in Nikko would be the more powerful partner. It would, under the accord to be announced today, buy 9.5 percent of Nikko's common stock, which has a current market value of about $540 million, and would also buy Nikko bonds that would be convertible into a further interest of about 15 percent of the brokerage firm, to give it about a 25 percent stake in the firm. Nikko is also expected to buy Travelers' shares in the open market to strengthen the link between the two companies.Both companies declined to make any comment on their pending alliance over the weekend.The Nikko investment carries big risks for Travelers, but also holds out the prospect of huge rewards if the joint venture works well and Travelers becomes the first American financial company to get extensive access to Japanese investors, who are currently estimated to have about $10 trillion of investments -- mostly invested in bank and savings deposits that yield less than 1 percent a year. Others are racing to try to reach the same goal in other ways; earlier this year, Merrill Lynch & Company bought some of the branches of the recently defunct Yamaichi Securities, and hired many of its former executives.The Travelers' move, which is much larger than the Merrill Lynch investment, also comes soon after the big Japanese brokerage firms -- Nomura, Daiwa and Nikko -- have been found guilty of, and sanctioned for, paying bribes to sokaiya, as Japan's racketeers are known.

5212	 1988	a	Pat Robertson's well-heeled Presidential campaign adjusted its financial course again today by agreeing to accept $4.5 million in Federal matching funds. But it pledged to put the money in escrow while Mr. Robertson decides whether to keep it or try to give it back.Mr. Robertson, the former television minister, has raised $11 million and is eligible for the additional $4.5 million in matching money. He had asked the Federal Election Commission to delay dispensing the matching money for 30 days while he decided whether to accept it.However, the Robertson campaign today withdrew the request and on Monday will receive the $4.5 million from the United States Treasury.Mr. Robertson's campaign manager, R. Marc Nuttle, said that the campaign ''plans to segregate the funds'' while deciding ''whether to seek an advisory opinion from the F.E.C. about the possibility of giving the money back to the American taxpayers without incurring any liabilities.''

5294	 1988	a	''I got a phone call and was told to call the Governor,'' Mr. Yevoli said. ''He got on the phone and said he wanted me to know this literature would be coming out. 'Lew,' he said, 'this is the kind of thing that's going to happen if you continue in your opposition.' Do I think he's behind it? All I know is that suddenly, mysteriously, came this literature the next day.'' 'Psychological Blackmail'Senator James J. Lack, a Suffolk County Republican named in one of the pamphlets, called them ''psychological blackmail.''''Do they really think,'' he said, ''that they can put some lies in a brochure and that I'm going to say: 'Oh, my, my, Mario's going to get me. I'd better make a public announcement Mario's right'? Does he think all the substantive points I raised I really didn't think were meaningful? That I made them up? That with threats and blackmail, they go away?''The Senate, which is controlled by the Republicans, has said it will not take up the Shoreham bill unless the Assembly, which is Democratic controlled, does so first. Mr. Miller, the Assembly Speaker, says he will not take it up unless a majority of the seven Assembly Democrats from the Island support it. But so far, four of the seven oppose it. As a result, Mr. Cuomo has concentrated his attacks on them.''Of course it bothers me, sure it bothers me,'' Mr. Miller said when asked if he was disturbed by the attacks on Democrats. ''He's playing the Republicans' game. It's a cheap shot, and it's no way to get this bill.''Mr. Cuomo implied that the Speaker should overrule the four Assemblymen. ''It presents an interesting question for the Assembly leadership,'' he said. ''Mel's quoted as saying he agrees with the deal. If you agree with the Governor that this is important to the safety of 2.7 million Long Islanders, what do yo do with the four people who disagree?'' A Special Session HintedMr. Cuomo has brought more and more of the weight of his office to bear. He says that, if necessary, he will convene a special session of the Legislature on Shoreham. He will travel to the Island this week to speak on a local television show. He has taken the unusual step of attacking legislators by name at news conferences and on radio.

6069	 1977	a	Mr. and Mrs. A. George Perecman of Orange, Conn., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Ellen Perecman, to Stephen Baskin Frankel, son of Mr. and Mrs. Stanley A. Frankel of Scarsdale, N.Y.Miss Perecman received a bachelor's degree from Sarah Lawrence College in 1975, after having spent her junior year studying in Paris. She attended Columbia University and is currently a doctoral candidate in psycholinguistics at the Graduate Center of City University. Her father is the owner of Perecman Jeweler's in New Haven.Mr. Frankel graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. degree in American studies from Princeton University. He received a law degree from Columbia Law School, where he was article and book‐review editor of The Columbia Human Rights Law Review. He is assistant county attorney in Westchester County.His father is vice president of Ogden Corporation in New York, specialists in the metal, transportation and food fields, and an adjunct professor at Baruch College. He was a member of several Presidential commissions, including the Advisory Commission to the Peace Corps under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson from 1961 to 1968.
6312	 1971	a	Restaurants reviewed on this page on Friday are rated both for their food (four stars to none) and for their atmosphere, service and decor (four triangles to none).** ?? The Griffin, 313 East 46th Street, 371–4542.In this year of folding restaurants, it is almost an act of perversity to open a serious new place in the high rent district. The Griffin, however, is off and running—and running well. It is nicely decorated with modem paintings, attractive though not museum pieces. Its staff function smoothly, as if they had been working together for a long time. The owner is on the premises, always a good sign. And the essentially French menu is quite well done, within its limits.The chilled salmon mousse has a fine texture and comes in a dill sauce. The quiche has an especially flaky crust (no butter was spared here). And the soups change daily, from one classic variety to another. One, for example, is potage Parmentier, a purée of leeks and potatoes.For main courses, the chicken. Gismonda was notably elegant. It consists of boneless chicken breasts on a bed of spinach in a rich sauce. Shrimp Capri is also impressively flavorful. The shrimp are cut so as to form a butterfly shape, and their tomato sauce is well spiced.
4705	 1992	a	To Sir Colin, a medium-sized man with light brown hair and an easy, jocular mannner, the fact that the Federal agency has set a deadline for comment bodes well, since Transportation Secretary Andrew H. Card can then make a decision.Mr. Card has said he will decide before President-elect Bill Clinton takes office. He has also said there are strong reasons to allow the investment.For one, he and others say, it would strenghten USAir financially and help secure the jobs of 47,000 American workers. It would also send a strong signal that the United States welcomes foreign investment in domestic companies.On the other hand, Mr. Card has also pushed the British hard in talks to let American carriers have similar rights to invest in British carriers. He has also sought what are called beyond rights, or the ability of American carriers to fly beyond major hubs like London.All four major United States carriers have said that they will go along with the British Airways investment in USAir if they get reciprocal rights. Sir Colin argues that his airline's deal should not be linked to granting United States carriers more rights in Britain. He said the proposal conformed to American laws and should be decided on its merits.Once the deal is made, he argues, Britain is prepared to negotiate a much greater liberalization over the next year, a process that will take time, since Congress and the Clinton Administration would have to approve the new terms. Negotiators' StanceBut negotiators for the American side say that such a strategy would mean giving up their most valuable chip and that they would have to rely on the good will of the British to open their market.

1558	 2010	a	Another day, another set of insider trading charges — this time revolving around two buddies accused of illicitly trading in MedImmune.The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday charged Stephen R. Goldfield, a former hedge fund manager, with illegally making a $14 million profit from trading in MedImmune before its takeover by AstraZenca.Also charged was James W. Self Jr., an executive at an unnamed pharmaceutical company accused of tipping off his friend Mr. Goldfield about MedImmune’s intentions to sell itself. Both men settled the charges.According to the S.E.C.’s complaint, Mr. Self learned through his company that MedImmune was looking to sell itself — because his employer was thinking about making a bid. He then tipped Mr. Goldfield, a classmate at the the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, about MedImmune’s intentions.Around April 2007, Mr. Self told Mr. Goldfield that the “weather was in the 50s,” a coded reference to his employer’s likelihood of making a bid for MedImmune in the $50-a-share range.Mr. Goldfield subsequently bought 17,000 call options and 255,000 common shares in MedImmune.AstraZeneca ultimately ended up buying MedImmune for $58 a share.In their settlements, neither man admitted or denied guilt. Mr. Goldfield agreed to a permanent injunction by the S.E.C. and to pay $600,000 of a proposed $16.6 million in disgorged profits and interest. Mr. Self agreed to pay a $50,000 fine.Go to S.E.C.

5805	 1985	a	But very quickly the Paines outgrew 50. Four years ago Josh was born; two years later Daniel came along.Mr. Paine often worked the night shift at Eastman Kodak, and he found that trying to sleep during the day in the small house was an art. In winter, with everyone cooped up, the hallway outside Mr. Paine's door sounded like the New Jersey Turnpike. ''The house had a real bad traffic pattern,'' said Mrs. Paine. ''The kids were up and down the hall constantly.''Last May, Mrs. Paine put a note in Mrs. Hoffman's mailbox suggesting a possible switch. Because no real-estate fees were involved, they could sell below the market price. The Hoffmans sold the bigger house for $67,000, though it was appraised at $80,000; the Paines sold the smaller house for $53,000, though the appraisal was $65,000.The larger house at 48 is just what the Paines needed. ''We can't get over having three bathrooms,'' Mrs. Paine said. For a while Josh, the 4-year-old, could find only two of them.Mr. and Mrs. Paine have done a lot already, including pulling up carpeting in the family room, putting in new storm doors and painting the boys' rooms. They plan much more. Their new home is so much bigger; they don't even have furniture for the dining room yet.''But for the Hoffmans, it was not quite as exciting as for us,'' said Mrs. Paine, 26. ''To settle for a smaller house, it's discouraging.''Mrs. Hoffman, 41, could not afford 48 any more. In December 1983 she was divorced. The judge gave her 18 months either to buy out her ex-husband or sell the big house and split the profit.

5400	 1987	a	Several pounds of plaster molding dropped from a ceiling in Gov. William Donald Schaefer's office today, landing squarely on the chair where the Governor often works. Mr. Schaefer was in another office in the State House at the time. Mr. Schaefer's aides said the Governor could have been seriously injured if he had been at the desk. William Shipley, the building superintendent, said, ''We have a leak up there and it didn't help much.''

3594	 1998	a	Even as the winning streak was growing to seven games and the city was beginning to notice St. John's again, Fran Fraschilla remembered the fable, as told by a sage named Carnesecca, of the peacock and the feather duster. In simpler days, today's preener was warned that it could become tomorrow's cleaning utensil. But that was before this impossible-to-figure Big East basketball season, and a St. John's team hat finds itself somewhere in between.When Notre Dame's late burst sent the Fighting Irish to a 73-65 victory at Madison Square Garden yesterday, the Red Storm learned that it was no longer as attractive as a team with seven consecutive victories, but nowhere as limited as the team that faced a crisis in late December. St. John's frustration came from the way it lost, especially when there was so much to be gained.''Was this a lost opportunity?'' Ron Artest, the freshman forward, was asked.He looked down and nodded. The Red Storm was playing before a noisy crowd of 12,390, its largest at home this season. A victory would have created the potential for a first national ranking in five years. It could have given the Red Storm the school's longest conference winning streak since the 1985 Final Four team won 14 straight, and should have carried St. John's one step closer to a National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament bid.After a few decisive moments, those possibilities were delayed, or gone. The Irish (11-7, 5-5) have won 4 of their last 6 games. Artest listened to someone say that even when St. John's was ahead, the Red Storm did not appear secure. Artest took the opposite view. ''We shouldn't be feeling secure,'' he said. ''That's what happened -- we got secure. That was the turning point.''

3096	 2001	a	Trina Clark aka Thunda, West Palm Beach, Fla., Nov. 5, 2000''That's my working corner, the corner where you can catch me. I see what's coming from both directions and if the law enforcement's coming. If I don't want a date to know that I'm male, I stand in the shade. I consider myself a real woman, but I'm not. I am a hustler.''I know what I have to get out of people to get what I need.That night, it was a so-so night. If I make $30 or better on my first date, my luck will be good all night, and my first date was $100 and something. I think I had eight or nine dates that night. A good night is 40 or better. I catch dates. I'm the one throwing the rod out there to pull in fish. I can get lucky. It can happen every day.''When I'm out there, I have to think about where I'm going to get a decent meal, trying to get a place to stay, where I am going to get a hot shower. (Taking a bath with a water hose isn't cutting it.) All that runs through my head. I don't ever think negative. I think positive. I get into a good mood -- not thinking that I'm all that, but just a good mood. Talking to myself and singing or making up songs in my head. My feet were hurting, but I'm not a quitter. I don't put myself down and say I'm not going to make enough tonight.''I need a place to stay. I've been homeless. My mother told me the streets are not like home. She was right. It's hard and it's rough, and you've got to know how to play the game. But I'm the original -- Thunda. I can't be anyone else, and nobody can be like me.'' interview by Catherine Saint Louis

6239	 1973	a	By WILLIAM ROBBINS Special to The New York Times WASHINGTON, Jan. 31—The Nixon Administration acted today to put millions of acres of idle farm land back into production and thus help check the rise in food prices.The action will also reduce the cost of farm subsidies. This year, total subsidies are expected to be $1‐billion below last year's levels.Food prices can be expected to begin reflecting the effects of the action after crops are in, in the late summer and fall, experts at the Department of Agriculture said.The move—a reduction in the amount of land that farmers must leave idle to qualify for subsidy payments on livestock feeds from the Federal Government, was announced by Earl L. Butz, the Secretary of Agriculture.

284	 2017	a	We have seen all of this before, employed by the K.G.B. and the East German Stasi: psychological warfare, rumor-mongering, schemes to bribe politicians and then expose them as criminals. They used it both internally, against dissidents, and externally, against Western enemies. Mr. Putin and his former K.G.B. colleagues should know that, this time, we have a better sense of their dirty tricks, and how they have updated Zersetzung for the internet.The government has its role to play, but so do journalists and civil-society groups. We journalists will put pressure on companies like Facebook and Twitter to be vigilant against fake news; we will expose the patterns of Russian agitprop where we see them.But it is just as important to be clear about the ideology driving these attacks. In September, my newspaper, Die Zeit, joined with the broadcaster ZDF to reveal details of Moscow’s highly sophisticated disinformation campaign. We had gained access to roughly 10,000 emails that showed how ideologues close to the Putin administration advised the pro-Russian rebel government in Eastern Ukraine.Among the emails was a document that set “thematic guidelines” which rebel-allied media outlets had to follow — if necessary by distorting facts and faking news. “Today’s Russia is no longer the Russia of the 1990s, but is working unwaveringly to re-establish the strength of the Soviet Union. Today’s Russia is on an equal footing with the West,” it read. “A global diplomatic war is underway. But the West is also suffering in this war, and it is still unclear who will prevail.”No doubt similar marching orders have been given to the armies of hackers who were sent to attack the Democrats, and who are now plotting attacks on Germany.It is quite clear who will lose. Mr. Putin and his reckless fakers should be aware that the only thing they will harvest from this mendacity is another lost generation of Russians who could serve their country better by being given the opportunity for honest and constructive intellectual challenges. A government that maligns the outside world to make feel Russia great again is doomed to fail — as it failed before.

4144	 1995	a	After the Federal agents finished their intensive search, after the Ted Koppel town meeting, after the small army of reporters had gone and without a single television camera left to record the event, the women here did what they always do when someone is in trouble: they put on a fund-raising supper.It was held tonight at the Lamotte Township Fire Hall, as such suppers usually are, but this time it was not for anyone they knew. It was for the survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing.In the past week, similar fund-raisers have undoubtedly been organized in thousands of small towns across America. But Decker, a conservative Republican area about 100 miles north of Detroit, in Michigan's rural "thumb" region and has one post office, one bar and 90 people, is not just another sleepy small community anymore. It is the place where James and Terry Nichols, who are being held as material witnesses in the Oklahoma City bombing, are accused of conspiring to make explosives with Timothy McVeigh, the primary suspect in the blast in Oklahoma City.In its own way, the fund-raising supper tells more about places like Decker than all the television specials, and the camera crews that have flooded the area since Federal agents blocked off the Nichols farm and began searching for explosives. If there were members of paramilitary groups present they didn't call attention to themselves. There were quite a few farmers dressed in work clothes, who had driven through high winds and a cold rain.

759	 2014	a	Here’s a last visit with Pete Seeger , starting with a beautiful, if grainy, video vignette from the Beacon Sloop Club Corn Festival in August, 2012 , as he led a chorus of “ So Long it’s Been Good to Know You ,” a Woody Guthrie tune that was a staple of the Weavers:As I mentioned early in the week, I had the opportunity to sing for him on Monday with other friends and family gathered in the hospital in his final hours. The song I chose was one I wrote recently about the stretch of the Hudson River Valley that Pete had called home from 1949 until his passing and that I moved to in 1991. It’s a particularly special spot where the river takes tight, deep turns as it cuts through an ancient mountain range worn into bluff hills.I was deeply moved when I played the fresh recording of the song for Pete last September at his home and he began to sing along, unbidden: “From Breakneck Ridge to the Bear Mountain Bridge, and all that lies between…”I’ve created a fresh video version of the song that begins with a snippet of video from that moment. Pete was always a generous listener and adviser when it came to lyrics and melodies. This is one last public “thank you” to a master of song, and life:Here are the hyper-linked lyrics, which I posted here a year ago along with an early version of the recording:

2349	 2005	a	Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students will examine their own opinions about science and explore how a famous film director is promoting interest in the sciences. They then create public service announcements aimed at young people.Author(s):Michelle Sale, The New York Times Learning NetworkBridget Anderson, The Bank Street College of Education in New York CitySuggested Time Allowance: 1 hourObjectives:Students will:1. Explore personal ideas about and interests in science.2. Consider how James Cameron plans to try to interest the public in the ocean depths by reading and discussing the article “Filmmaker Employs the Arts to Promote the Sciences.”3. In groups, use an assigned topic to create public service announcements promoting science.4. Complete their PSAs by filming, storyboarding or designing them, and present them to science classes.Resources / Materials:-student journals-pens/pencils-paper-classroom board-copies of the article “Filmmaker Employs the Arts to Promote the Sciences,” found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050201tuesday.html (one per student) -resources about various science topics (science textbooks, encyclopedias, computers with Internet access)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following prompt (written on the board prior to class): “Director and screenwriter James Cameron said that humans must examine science from a standpoint of ‘wonder, awe and mystery.’ What experiences with nature or science have impressed you most? Why? In general, do you think your peers are interested in science? Why or why not?” After a few minutes, allow students time to share their answers.Using a show of hands, ask students: How many of you are interested in science? How many of you want to become scientists or work in a scientific field?Introduce James Cameron, the director and screenplay writer who is the focus of the article, “Filmmaker Employs the Arts to Promote the Sciences,” with biographical information found at //www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/cam0bio-1.2. As a class, read and discuss the article “Filmmaker Employs the Arts to Promote the Sciences” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050201tuesday.html), focusing on the following questions:a. What movie is the center of discussion in the article?b. What technologies are used to make this movie?c. How does the author of the article describe the experience of watching the film?d. What argument does James Cameron make about getting people interested in science and research?e. How many dives did it take for Mr. Cameron to get material for his film?f. What was Mr. Cameron’s goal for this film?g. How many submersibles can reach the deepest parts of the ocean?h. What did Mr. Cameron discover about hydrothermal vents through his research?i. What deep-sea topics, according to Mr. Cameron, are most unknown?j. When will people begin looking at energy issues, according to Mr. Cameron?l. Why, according to the interview, aren’t most people concerned with the depletion of the sea’s “great predatory species”?m. When does Mr. Cameron think people will really understand that global climate change is real?n. What technical challenges did Mr. Cameron face while making “Filmmaker Employs the Arts to Promote the Sciences”?o. Why doesn’t Mr. Cameron think Hollywood has done a good job in portraying science in movies?p. What motivates scientists to study how the earth works and how life works?q. What type of science is used to make cellphones?r. Why does Mr. Cameron think there is a “backswing” against science?s. What does Mr. Cameron think will be the science stories of the 21st century?t. To Mr. Cameron, for what is science a metaphor?3. Divide into groups of four. Explain to students that each group will be responsible for creating a public service announcement (video, storyboard or print advertisement, depending upon resources) that shows kids that science is “cool” and focuses on a particular science topic.Assign groups a topic mentioned in the article, “Filmmaker Employs the Arts to Promote the Sciences,” such as outer space, the ocean depths, volcanic activity, animal extinction, global warming and natural resources. For example, the group assigned the deep ocean can focus their PSA on a topic such as deep sea creatures, hydrothermal vents, or exploration, or compile various subtopics into a single PSA with a unifying theme. Encourage students to create a piece that shows how science is relevant to the everyday lives of young people.Direct students to include the following information in their PSA (written on the board or copied into a handout for easier student access):-adjectives to describe science beyond “cool” for a slogan to be used in their PSA (“Science is ”)-fun facts or interesting superlatives relating to your topic-career options and training programs-connections of this area of science to everyday life-importance and value of this topicOnce research is completed, groups should work together to brainstorm and complete written scripts for their PSAs.4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Groups should either film, storyboard or design their PSAs, to be viewed or presented in a future class. (Before leaving class, groups should divide responsibilities so that each individual is working on a section for homework.) Other science classes may be invited to see the PSAs.Further Questions for Discussion:-What do you find most interesting about science? Why?-Why don’t some people find science to be interesting?-What do you do to take care of our world and environment?-How is an Imax movie different from a regular movie?-Why are scientists often stereotyped as nerds?-What subjects or issues are you curious about? Why?-How does research help to advance a civilization?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on completion of initial journal assignment, participation in class and group discussions, and thoughtful completion of planning and creating the PSAs.Vocabulary:celluloid, melded, geophysics, enchanted, submersibles, canvassed, biologists, geologists, riotously, chemosynthesis, photosynthesis, resilience, organisms, hydrothermal, volcanism, periodically, clarion, predatory, hybrid, mariculture, apex, stimulus, thermal, insurmountable, rig, idiosyncratic, villains, materialistic, aesthetically, pharmaceutical, semiconductors, quantum, electromagnetic, ascendancy, agrarian, efficiencies, pollution, metaphoricallyExtension Activities:1. Write a report on a famous scientist who has worked or is working in the area of science you examined during class.2. Create a brochure about the relationship between humans and the ocean. Include both what humans get out of the oceans (in terms of natural resources, environmental stability) and how humans influence the oceans. Also include how changes to the ocean will affect people both directly and indirectly, and in the short term and long term.3. Watch a movie that is centered on a scientific phenomenon, such as “Twister” (1996), “The Day After Tomorrow” (2004), or “Jurassic Park” (1993). Write a reaction paper about how accurately or inaccurately science is portrayed. Include examples of how science is portrayed, as well as your assessment of how it was represented. Then grade the movie on its scientific accuracy. Compile each individual report into a science movie review section for the school newspaper.Interdisciplinary Connections:Fine Arts – Create an artistic representation of a scientific concept. You may choose to create a performance, painting, collage, film, poem, etc. Your creation must include the basic concepts and elements of the science, but also should reflect on the “wonder, awe and mystery” of this concept or idea.Technology -Create a diagram of a submersible used to study the deep ocean. Include its appearance, what materials it is made of, the kinds of equipment that are inside, how they are powered and how they communicate with the surface, and what sort of conditions it needs to be able to withstand to survive deep ocean exploration.-Create a “How It Works” poster explaining how a 3-D film is made, including the role the special glasses play in viewing this special effect.Journalism – Interview a local scientist about his or her career and work, and the importance of science in the world. Write an article for the school newspaper.Teaching with The Times – Read an article in the Science Times and write a reflection paper examining the facts, ideas or concepts that are most interesting to you.

3858	 1997	a	Simms's test will come if Parcells's Jets sink into a losing streak, or if Simms's reverence becomes too evident. As an analyst, Simms has proven to be one of the best; honest about plays but rarely critical personally.''Whether they win or lose, there'll be a lot to say,'' Simms said.''Our relationship will never change. I'm still the player; he's still the coach. I hold him in reverence. Maybe that's not a good thing for a journalist, but that's the situation.''Last Friday, Simms became one of numerous Giants alumni to visit the Jets' camp or be employed by the team, from Carl Banks and Pepper Johnson to Mark Bavaro and Jumbo Elliott.''I felt bad for the ex-Jets,'' said Simms, ''especially the ones who played a long time. But Bill says, 'I need people around me who know what I want so I don't have to coach them.' Still, I wonder how the old Jets must feel. I wish they could be there. I'd have the same feeling.''Watching the Jets practice made Simms feel as if he had never played. ''It was like, 'Wow, look at this,' as if I'd never done it before.' Then Jumbo comes by. And he's huge. But what amazes me is I used to talk to Jumbo like he was one my kids. 'Do this! Do that!' He could have driven me down like a nail. But he didn't. That's the general order of things. I was the quarterback.''Although Simms's feelings toward Parcells have obviously not changed, his partisanship toward the Giants -- they released him unceremoniously in 1994 -- has faded. ''I've moved on,'' he said. ''But when I played, I hated the A.F.C.''NBC is the American Football Conference network, so Simms is allegiant to it. And this season, for the first time, he will call a Jets game.

6059	 1977	a	NAIROBI, Kenya, May 31—Kenya's Minister for Tourism and Wildlife said today that the Government would follow up its ban on big‐game hunting with a program to crack down on poachers, whose activities are a major cause of the dwindling of the country's wildlife.While conceding that legal hunting accounted for the deaths of only 6,000 animals last year, the minister, Matthew J. Ogutu, said the ban would enable game wardens to spot poachers more easily, since killing of any kind would now be outlawed.In the past, he noted, hunters and poachers used the same kind of weapons and operated in the same areas, and so it was difficult to distinguish between them. “Now, anyone found killing breaking the law,” he said. “The Government has the long arm to stamp out the poachers.”The minister said that $2.9 million would be spent on helicopters, LandRovers and radios to step up his department's antipoaching patrols. The World Bank is supplying the money.

4071	 1996	a	The players suspended are German Mesa, a smooth-fielding 27-year-old shortstop who had been a national idol, pitcher Orlando Hernandez and catcher Alberto Hernandez. According to news accounts from Havana, all three were summoned Monday to the headquarters of Cuban State Security and questioned for several hours about their relationship with Juan Ignacio Hernandez Nodar, a sports agent.Hernandez Nodar is a cousin and former assistant of Joe Cubas, the Miami sports agent who arranged the defection of the bulk of the nearly dozen Cuban baseball players who have signed contracts with Major League Baseball teams over the past five years. Granma said Hernandez Nodar was preparing to take the three players out of Cuba ''in a fraudulent manner'' and now faces criminal charges for having attempted to do so.''Through the investigations that have been carried out, it has been convincingly demonstrated that he first collaborated in these actions with the notorious trafficker Joe Cubas, who dedicates himself to harassing, bribing and corrupting Cuban sportsmen,'' the Granma account said of Hernandez Nodar. ''Lately he has done so on his own and has been the direct instigator of organizing the defection of our athletes.''The Cuban Government has vowed to bring down ''the full weight of the law'' on Hernandez Nodar, who is not related to either of the banned players with the same surname. It was not clear whether charges had already been filed against him, but Prensa Latina said the agent had been ''carrying out the work of attracting young players'' and had developed ''close ties'' with the suspended players by offering them gifts.''This is directed not only at me but at the remaining players on the Cuban national team,'' Cubas said in an interview here, adding that he had sought to persuade the three suspended players to defect, but that all had refused. ''The Cuban Government is trying to send the message that, should you be in a position to defect and we catch you beforehand, you will pay the price.''

2353	 2005	a	A 14-year-old boy died yesterday when he was struck by a pickup truck in South Jamaica, the police said. The boy, identified by the authorities as Jayvon Hammond, 14, of 131st Avenue in Jamaica, darted between two buses idling on Merrick Boulevard near the intersection of Baisley Boulevard just before 3 p.m. He was struck by a black pickup truck that was traveling west on Merrick Boulevard, and was pronounced dead at the scene, the police said. The driver of the truck stayed at the scene and was not charged, the police said. Ana Germoso, who owns the house where the boy's family lives in an upstairs apartment, said that the family had lived there only a short while, and that Jayvon was "a very good boy."

3512	 1999	a	TELLINGA Memoir of Rape and Recovery.By Patricia Weaver Francisco.Cliff Street/HarperCollins, $23.For many rape survivors, the shame, fear and anger they feel are often followed by silence. For Patricia Weaver Francisco, who was raped in her downtown Minneapolis apartment just before her 30th birthday in 1981, the hush that fell over her was in response to people's reactions. ''Every time I told someone that I had been raped, I caused a small explosion,'' she writes in ''Telling: A Memoir of Rape and Recovery.'' Five years after her attack, Francisco had flashbacks while in labor for 36 hours. She writes that during the moments leading up to the emergency Caesarean section (which saved her baby's life), she felt ''trapped, expected to cooperate, somehow doomed to accept what is happening to me. I've been here before.'' Thirteen years after the attack, the despair returned while Francisco attended the trial of Timothy Baugh, who was charged with raping several women in the same Minneapolis neighborhood where she was attacked. Although Francisco's assailant was never caught, she took comfort in knowing Baugh -- the surrogate'' -- was convicted. Her intimate account of rape's repercussions includes details about the strain it put on her marriage (she and her husband struggled for 13 years before divorcing) and Francisco's decision to tell her young son about her ordeal. Francisco, who teaches creative writing at Hamline University in St. Paul, encourages others to start a dialogue about the ''unspeakable'' crime. Francisco warns against keeping quiet: ''Evil is best borne when it's fully visible.'' Nancy Gavilanes

10993	 1944	a	|FRANCHISE UP IN BERMUDA; New Bill for Votes for Women Said to Have an Even Chance
5978	 1981	a	A bias against modern dance and lack of understanding of Isadora Duncan's role in its foundation is reflected by the English critic Edward Thorpe in an article in the souvenir program in which he expresses his ignorance of the subject. His questionable assertion that Isadora Duncan left no codified technique overlooks entirely the very principle of personalized creativity she laid down that has made 20th-century dance, including ballet, more than a closed system. Mr. Thorpe's wife, Gillian Freeman, wrote the script that Mr. MacMillan uses as a sequential outline, and she, at least, has used familiar documented source material.It is so familiar, in fact, that every episode is predictable to anyone who has read the same books, and more, as Miss Freeman. It was obvious then that when a lesbian from the Loie Fuller company makes advances to Isadora, that this duet will be succeeded by one with the Hungarian actor Oscar Beregi, and then with the designer and stage theoretician, Gordon Craig, and so on. When an actress, who is Isadora's speaking double, comes out in a red dress and gives Isadora's famous Boston speech, we know she will actually bare a breast on cue.Where does the distortion, then, come in? In the lack of balance of the ballet, of course. No one would bother to do a ballet about Isadora Duncan's life merely because she had a series of lovers. It is her stature as an artist that is the reason, but that stature is nonexistent here.The reply that Mr. MacMillan does, in fact, touch upon her dancing, begs the question. He is, in effect, in danger of confusing a public that may not realize how stylized his version of Duncan dances are and that these are not the real thing.As an admirer of most of Mr. MacMillan's work, this writer can experience a twinge of distress at his literalness in the duets. Only once does this approach work - in the duet for Isadora and Craig. The choreography is daring in every sense, inventive in its lifts, such as one in which she is swung out and then bisects Craig's body with her legs. Avant-gardists both, they were a very modern couple. Merle Park, who gives a magnificently sustained performance as the dancing Isadora and Julian Hosking as Craig, made this duet as credible and startling as it should be.
5922	 1983	a	For all the good pitching, it was daring baserunning by Mookie Wilson that won the second game.After singling to lead off the 12th and moving to second on Brooks's sacrifice bunt, Wilson, with Keith Hernandez on first on an intentional walk, took a gamble. George Foster grounded to the second baseman Johnny Ray, who flipped to Dale Berra for the force on Hernandez.''Before the pitch, I checked with Bobby,'' said Wilson, referring to the third-base coach Bobby Valentine. ''He signaled that if it was ground ball, go all the way.''Berra realized a split-second too late what was happening. His throw to the plate was too late as Wilson scored the winning run.''I think we stole a run on that one,'' Wilson said.The Mets won the first game when Bob Bailor singled with the bases loaded off Jim Bibby (3-10). The game had seemed to be over in the first inning, when the Met starter, Walt Terrell, gave up a grand slam to Jason Thompson.But with the Mets trailing, 6-2, in the eighth, Hernandez led off with a home run over the right-field fence off the Pirate starter Lee Tunnell. Foster greeted the reliever Rod Scurry with his 17th homer over the left-field fence, and the Mets were on the move.Scurry walked Darryl Strawberry and then was replaced by Tekulve. With one out, Brian Giles singled to put men on first and second. Rusty Staub loaded the bases when his apparent double-play grounder was bobbled by Berra.Strawberry scored from third as Bailor hit into a fielder's choice. Wilson lined a single to right to score Giles with the tying run.

321	 2017	a	VOORHEES, N.J. — To really irritate Ian Laperriere, the assistant coach in charge of the Philadelphia Flyers’ penalty-killing unit, all a player needs to do is avoid an opponent’s slap shot. The Flyers know Laperriere certainly never did that when he played hockey.Laperriere, whom everyone calls Lappy, was hit in the face with flying pucks, too — twice in one fateful season. The second slap shot, launched by Devils defenseman Paul Martin in April 2010, ultimately led to Laperriere’s retirement in June 2012.“Any player who’s willing to put his face in front of a slapper, you’ve got to respect what he’s saying,” said Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, a veteran forward who kills penalties for the Flyers. “When Lappy tells you something, he’s not telling you something to mess around.”Laperriere still remembers everything about being hit by Martin’s shot — the dive to block it, the impact, the ringing in his ears, the lost vision in his right eye. He even remembers the first thing he said to the Flyers’ trainer when he came out to attend to him.
1860	 2008	a	At one point this season, the Madison Square Garden fans were busy chanting for the team to re-sign forward Sean Avery. But now, with Avery out for the season with a lacerated spleen and the Rangers’ playoff lives seemingly resting on the shoulders of captain Jaromir Jagr and goalie Henrik Lundqvist, the free agent the Garden fans are showering with attention is Jagr.He was greeted in warmups with signs saying, “Come Back J.J.” and fans chanted his name throughout the game. While Jagr brushed off all talk of his future after the game, even his teammates admitted it meant something.“I think it means a lot,” said center Brandon Dubinsky. “It’s a good feeling when you have your home crowd behind you and they let you know how much they appreciate you. It was nice to hear our fans acknowledge him and what he’s contributed and what he’s continuing to contribute. I think it feels good for him and feels good for the rest of us too.”Jagr scored the biggest goal of the season in the second period, the first goal of the game and the one that spelled the end for Pittsburgh in this game. Adding to its drama, Jagr was knocked nearly cold by the shoulder of Penguins defenseman Brooks Orpik just after he scored. He lay on the ice for awhile, but eventually was helped up and skated to the bench. He did not miss a shift.“It was great,” said center Scott Gomez. “He’s definitely taken his game to another level. Every time he touched the puck, he was a threat. It’s great when your captain’s going like that. He’s been playing like that for a long time. You can tell we definitely fed off him.”Jagr, though, rightfully shared star billing with Lundqvist, who had a spectacular game. He stopped two breakaways by Penguins star Evgeni Malkin and that is not even counting the penalty shot Malkin was awarded after a small shove from Rangers defenseman Dan Girardi. The penalty shot may have been one of the easier saves Lundqvist made because Malkin skated in so slowly and waited so long, he had almost no options by the time he took his shot. Lundqvist knocked it away with his glove.It was Lundqvist’s second penalty-shot save of the playoffs (the first came against New Jersey’s John Madden) but this was his first shutout of the playoffs. It came at the perfect time for the Rangers, who needed perfection to stave off elimination.As for Avery, he remains in intensive care at St. Vincent’s Hospital but the Rangers said he was improving.

7530	 1964	a	LONDON, Nov. 29—George Balanchine's “Serenade” has become one of the staples of the Royal Ballet repertory, and yesterday at Covent Garden it was a pleasure to see it danced for the first time by a completely new cast of principals.Vyvyan Lorrayen, Monica Mason, Merel Park, Keith Rosson and Graham Usher gave the ballet with enormous zest and that cool “Chekhov” passion it demands.Miss Mason and Mr. Rosson were particularly successful, but the entire cast won its laurels, and the Corps de Ballet has never been seen better in this production.Also on view were the young New Zealander Laurence Ruffell, making a very polished first attempt at the leading role in “Les Patineurs,” and a new cast in the recently revived “A Wedding Bouquet.”

3289	 2000	a	A month ago, Mr. Jordan, now an executive with the Washington Wizards N.B.A. team, told a reporter that after his multimillion-dollar sponsorship contracts expired in the next few years, he would shift toward managing his own businesses.That lesson has not been lost on the N.B.A., which has been moving aggressively to find new ways to profit from the league.N.B.A. Entertainment, a unit created in 1982, produces television and movie programming centered on the N.B.A. There is also a theme restaurant, N.B.A. City in Orlando, a series of popular N.B.A. home videos and even a sitcom in the works. And this week, the N.B.A. was host to a celebrity fashion show featuring N.B.A. players alongside the actress Carmen Electra, as a way to increase sales of its merchandise and promote the idea that the league is a trendsetter in the fashion world.''The line between sports and entertainment has become nearly nonexistent,'' Mr. Brew at Addison said. ''It's now an organization that is entertainment-based rather than sports-based.''Indeed, ''Michael Jordan to the Max,'' could not come at a better time for the N.B.A. The playoffs are just under way, and the league is suffering from television ratings that are down sharply since Mr. Jordan retired in 1998. But Mr. Jordan's star has not yet dimmed.''There's no question he has staying power; he hasn't disappeared from the map at all,'' said Gregory K. Leonard, an economist who in 1997 released a study showing that in the early 1990's, Mr. Jordan bolstered league revenues by about $53 million a year. ''But it's unclear how long this will last because there haven't been that many precedents.''The IMAX film will allow the N.B.A. to ride the coattails of the most celebrated person to ever play the game. And if the film does gross $100 million in the first year, the N.B.A. and Mr. Jordan can thank Don and Steve Kempf, who produced and directed the IMAX project with James D. Stern, a theater and film producer from Chicago.

922	 2013	a	Amar’e Stoudemire will make his season debut for the Knicks on Tuesday night, coming off the bench against the Portland Trail Blazers at Madison Square Garden.Coach Mike Woodson could not say for sure how many minutes he would play Stoudemire, who had surgery on his left knee in October.“We’ve just got to gauge his minutes and ease him back in,” Woodson said. “He’ll come off the bench tonight and we’ll gauge it as the game goes along.”Stoudemire averaged 17.5 points and 7.8 rebounds in 47 games last season, and his arrival does come at an opportune time. Carmelo Anthony, who missed the past two games with a hyperextended left knee, will be back in the lineup; however, the Knicks are still without guard Raymond Felton (broken pinkie) and forward Rasheed Wallace (stress fracture in left foot).Still, Woodson said it was unlikely Stoudemire would play close to 30 minutes.“We’ve just got to slowly work him back in,” Woodson said.Stoudemire was originally expected to return Christmas Day, when they Knicks played the Lakers in Los Angeles. He practiced Sunday and Monday and said he was willing to risk playing at 80 percent in order to help out his team.Woodson said he was not sure yet how the team’s rotations might alter with Stoudemire’s return. “I’ll tinker with him tonight,” Woodson said. “I’ve got some ideas, but those ideas always change.”Whether Stoudemire, a six-time All-Star, will come off the bench or return to the starting lineup down the road remains uncertain. Woodson said he was not ready to make a decision on that.“Just get him through the game and ready for practice tomorrow,” Woodson said.
2111	 2007	a	Each month, The Journal, the New York City Housing Authority’s monthly tabloid newspaper, publishes a Not Wanted List of former public housing residents who have been “permanently excluded,” because of criminal arrests or for being nuisances, a broad category known as “nondesirability.”As Manny Fernandez explains in a front-page article, the Housing Authority is within its legal rights to exclude violent and disruptive tenants, but some of those on the list say that they are being punished permanently for past mistakes and that it is unfair for them to be prevented from visiting family members, including ailing and elderly parents. Although there is an appeals process, the Housing Authority can move to evict a family found harboring someone on the Not Wanted List.Mets Complete Stunning CollapseWith an 8-1 loss to the Florida Marlins, the Mets were eliminated from postseason competition, completing one of the biggest collapses in baseball history. With the Phillies now headed to the playoffs, Mets fans are left to contemplate the future of the team’s manager, Willie Randolph, for whom the collapse has been a bitter disappointment. The team will also have to dismantle two auxiliary seating boxes it had placed beside each dugout last week.The Times’s coverage of the Mets’ debacle includes an article by Robert D. McFadden on the dismayed reaction of Mets fans, as well as columns by William C. Rhoden and George Vecsey.The Daily News’s main article on the Mets’ devastation notes the agony of fans. The News’s cover: “From Champs to Chumps.”The New York Post’s front-page headline reads “Cryin’ Shame” and its lead article on the team’s debacle quips, “It’s never been more appropriate for a team to play in a city called Flushing.”Plaza Hotel’s CentennialThe Plaza Hotel opened 100 years ago today, adjacent to the southeastern corner of Central Park, and James Barron chronicles the hotel’s storied history and surprising future. The Plaza — where Truman Capote held his famous Black and White Ball in 1966 — is now being converted into one of the most expensive condominium properties in the city. A much smaller hotel will continue to occupy the building. A slide show of images from the Plaza accompanies the article.The New York Sun tallies the profit that Elad Properties, the developer, stands to make in converting the Plaza to a hotel-condominium.On City Room, Curtis Gathje, a writer and editor, has been taking questions from readers about the Plaza’s history.Questions in Gotbaum DeathThe city’s public advocate, Betsy Gotbaum, said she was awaiting results of an investigation into the death of her stepdaughter-in-law, Carol A. Gotbaum, who was found dead in a police holding cell at a Phoenix airport on Friday after being detained and prevented from boarding a flight.An article on the Web site of Channel 12 News in Phoenix quotes airline officials as saying that Carol Gotbaum had become agitated after arriving late for a flight and discovering that the jetway had already become disconnected from the plane.The Daily News quotes a Phoenix police spokesman as saying that Carol Gotbaum could not have been alone for more than 5 to 10 minutes. The News also quotes unnamed airport workers as saying that Ms. Gotbaum was agitated and screamed “I’m not a terrorist!” while being restrained.Carol Gotbaum’s husband, Noah, is the son of Victor Gotbaum, Betsy Gotbaum’s husband and the former leader of District Council 37, New York City’s largest consortium of public sector unions.Spitzer’s Green TeamGov. Eliot Spitzer has assembled a team of the state’s leading environmental advocates in his effort to give the State Department of Environmental Conservation a greater role and prominence in the formation of state environmental policy. Anthony DePalma examines the implications of having people move from advocacy groups into government agencies.Canadian Dollar Reaches Parity With American DollarThe Canadian dollar, or loonie, has reached parity with the American dollar, prompting speculation that many more Canadians will be traveling south of the border for shopping and tourism excursions in New York City and other United States destinations. On Friday, the Canadian dollar, known as the loonie, hit a new 31-year high of almost $1.01. In early 2002, it was worth about 62 cents. Canada is already the second largest source of foreign tourists to New York City, after Britain, and the city is about to establish a tourism office in Toronto.Bloomberg Addresses Britain’s ToriesSpeaking of the British: As part of a quick trip to France and England, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg addressed members of Britain’s Conservative Party at their conference in the decaying seaside resort of Blackpool, England. As Diane Cardwell explains, the mayor used his speech to defend principles of fiscal conservatism, which he said American conservatives had largely abandoned. In June, Mr. Bloomberg left the Republican Party and declared himself a political independent. In England, the mayor also defended his own record of fiscal stewardship; spending and taxes have grown under his watch.The New York Sun reports that Diana Torres, who started the New York office of Think London, which encouraged businesses to do business in the British capital, has switched sides and will work for the Partnership for New York City’s efforts to keep New York globally competitive. Ms. Torres is half-American but grew up in Britain and was educated at Cambridge University.Other News From The TimesPolice Commissioner Raymond W.

2870	 2002	a	The Sept. 11 attacks made this the deadliest year for police officers since 1974, although when victims at the World Trade Center are excluded, the number killed in the line of duty increased only slightly, two police organizations say.The groups, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund and the Concerns of Police Survivors, said a total of 231 federal, state and local police officers were killed in 2001, up from 150 in 2000.If those killed at the World Trade Center are excluded, the number is 160.A total of 71 officers died at the trade center, the two groups said, among them 37 from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and 23 from the New York City Police Department.The groups said the national toll of officers killed on duty had been rising since 1999, when it reached 130, the lowest level since 1965.

1110	 2012	a	INDIANAPOLIS — If Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski can’t play in Super Bowl XLVI because of a high ankle sprain, there might not be anyone to fill his shoes.It feels like tempting fate for the Patriots, who streamrolled the league with their dual threats — Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez — but they have no other tight ends on the active roster. Carson Butler has been stashed on the practice squad for 16 months.The New England tight ends coach, Brian Ferentz, agrees that it is an odd situation.“You are living a little dangerously at times when most of our offense is geared toward having two tight ends out there,” Ferentz said. “My argument is that the offense never changes, just the people who are in there.”But the Patriots haven’t been satisfied with most of their other options, waiving tight ends Will Yeatman and Dan Gronkowski and offensive tackle Thomas Welch, who lined up as an eligible receiver at times. Those duties have been handed to the rookie offensive tackle Nate Solder, who started at tight end for two seasons with the University of Colorado.“I’ve been flexible,” said Solder, who is primarily a blocker when he serves as the third tight end. “I’ve been playing all sorts of different positions, and I just go in wherever they need me.”He may have to go in often Sunday, although Hernandez doesn’t seem too worried about Gronkowski, who has not practiced this week after leading the N.F.L. with 17 receiving touchdowns.“Everybody needs to step up if Rob isn’t 100 percent, because he draws so much attention and is such a threat on the field,” Hernandez said. “I think he’ll play. I think he’ll be a big impact in this game.”And on the other sideline? The Giants have kept three tight ends — Jake Ballard, Bear Pascoe and Travis Beckum — on their active roster all season despite relying on their wide receivers for the downfield passing game.

971	 2013	a	And to Drink… Eric Asimov, the wine critic for The New York Times, suggests a drink pairing for one of the week’s recipes.Pairing decisions are part analytical and, importantly, part emotional. Almost nothing will go better with this creamy, pungent, savory ramp omelet by David Tanis than those two amplifiers of umami, fino sherry and Champagne. That’s the rational choice, yet what I want most is gamay, the grape of Beaujolais. Why? Back in the old days, when being able to prepare a perfect omelet was considered evidence of cooking ability, my custom for my first meal on any trip to France was to stop in at a cafe or bar à vin for an omelet, with a glass of the easygoing house Beaujolais. For me, this combination was comfort and beauty. Nowadays, I might choose a gamay from the Loire Valley, or one of the few American versions, like Edmunds St. John’s, which I think come closer to those lighthearted yet compelling wines. The rational choice? Maybe not, but it sure felt like a great one.What would you pair with this dish? Post your suggestions in the comments section.

1427	 2011	a	Sara Krulwich/The New York TimesFRIDAY’S PUZZLE — The comedian Emo Philips once did a bit about using chocolate Easter bunnies as a diagnostic tool in psychotherapy. I don’t remember exactly how it went, but to paraphrase, he was told that the first part he bit off would clue the therapist in to where his problem lies: if he bit off the ears first, for example, it meant that he was relatively normal; if he bit off the feet first, it meant he felt he wasn’t getting anywhere in life. His reply: “What if I bite out the eyes and scream ‘Stop staring at me!‘?”The middle entry at 32 Across reminded me of that joke. “Earful for getting an eyeful” is a very clever clue for DON’T STARE.There’s more to be mined here, wordplay-wise. “Pieces of eight?” made me laugh when I finally realized that Ed Sessa was thinking about musical pieces (OCTETS), not pirates’ booty, and I thought that TOWN was a great answer to the misdirecting “Hamlet’s cousin.”I messed up slightly at the 46 Across/40 Down because I confidently filled in BENEFIT instead of BENEFIC, which left me flummoxed as to what course might use a fridge (the answer is HOME EC). At first, I wasn’t quite sure who uses BUGLES for mating calls, but I am told that the bugler, in this case, is the mighty bull mooseThanks to Mr. Sessa for throwing a Monty Python reference into the grid at 24 Down, but since I am in a T.G.I.F. mood, I’d like to dance out with some music from the “Ones who might get you into hot water?” (a brilliant clue):Your thoughts?
4127	 1995	a	It was just one line in an otherwise unremarkable meeting on Monday, but it surprised the officials in the room: Secretary of State Warren Christopher suggested that the West should begin to think about a Russia without Boris N. Yeltsin.Mr. Christopher's declaration came in response to a question by Italy's Foreign Minister, Susanna Agnelli, who expressed concern about the Russian President's leadership. She bluntly asked Mr. Christopher whether the West should "go on supporting" him, according to participants in the meeting."Perhaps the world should be looking for an alternative," a senior Italian official paraphrased Mr. Christopher as saying.Ms. Agnelli declined in an interview to characterize Mr. Christopher's thinking on the sensitive subject. But she said that the time has come to look beyond Mr. Yeltsin.
3686	 1998	a	In the 1950's the passion for finding important moral lessons buried in ''Lolita'' was fed by the moral attacks against the book. The book was turned down by four American publishers before Olympia Press, a French press best known for its smut, published ''Lolita'' in 1955. Shortly thereafter, the book was banned in France. Finally, in 1958, an American publisher, G. P. Putnam's Sons, picked it up.The most recent wave of moral defense was sparked, yet again, by moral outrage against ''Lolita.'' In 1997, while Adrian Lyne, the director of the new movie version of ''Lolita,'' searched for an American distributor, Norman Podhoretz wrote in Commentary that ''Lolita'' bore ''some share of the blame for the plague of pedophilia.'' Now, after much waiting and a brand new layer of moral justifications, the new ''Lolita'' will be shown on Showtime tomorrow night and released in theaters in September. Here are the lessons of ''Lolita'' in their 1950's and 1990's versions.Lolita is a cautionary tale.Professor Ray said ''Lolita'' carried a warning: ''The wayward child, the egotistic mother, the panting maniac -- these are not only vivid characters in a unique story; they warn us of dangerous trends; they point out potent evils. Lolita should make all of us -- parents, social workers, educators -- apply ourselves with still greater vigilance and vision to the task of bringing up a better generation in a safer world.''Last year the philosopher Colin McGinn made a similar argument in an essay titled ''The Moral Case for 'Lolita,' '' in The Times Literary Supplement: ''This is not a prettification or celebration or endorsement of Humbert's actions. . . . It is an open expression of misery, remorse, guilt and regret. . . . The book sees right into the heart of Humbert's deceptiveness, brutality and depravity; in no sense does it seek to excuse or mitigate them. . . . We are never for a moment encouraged to approve of his actions.All men are Humberts.This logic was first given by Humbert himself, when he says he is not the first man to fall in love with a child: ''After all, Dante fell madly in love with his Beatrice when she was 9, a sparkling girleen, painted and lovely. . . . And when Petrarch fell madly in love with his Laureen, she was a fair-haired nymphet of 12 running in the wind, in the pollen and dust.''
2673	 2004	a	Where Mr. Clarke is the high priest of sci-fi's faith in the human intellect manifest in technology, Mr. Ballard and the others regard technology as a dangerous extension of human psychopathology. Thus in "Crash" the automobile is a tool for sex and self-destruction. In "High-Rise" and the more recent "Cocaine Nights" and "Super-Cannes," the globally replicated blandness of modern cities, highways and airports is the environment of a new totalitarianism that is, he says here, "docile and subservient, and all the more threatening for that." "The New Totalitarians come forward," he writes, "smiling obsequiously like head waiters in third-rate Indian restaurants, and assuring us that everything is for our benefit."Technology not only threatens but also disappoints. Mr. Ballard is almost cruel on the collapse of the space age. Rockets "belong to the age of the 19th century, along with the huge steam engines. It's brute-force ballistic technology that has nothing to do with what people recognize as the characteristic technology of this century: microprocessors, microwave data links -- everything that goes in the world at the speed of an electron."Worse, the space race made for lousy television. "The suspicion dawned that Outer Space might be -- dare one say it -- boring. Having expended all these billions of dollars on getting to the Moon, we found on our arrival that there wasn't very much to do there."Mr. Ballard saw the World Trade Center attack as a kind of brutal intrusion of the imminent future into the present. "The attack on the World Trade Center in 2001 was a brave attempt to free America from the 20th Century," he opines. "The deaths were tragic, but otherwise it was a meaningless act." And in another passage: "The horrific newsreels are effectively the greatest disaster movie to date. My fear is that in due course the 'remake' of 9/11, with the ultimate in special effects, will inspire Americans to more than revenge."He is not usually so callous. In 2001, he remarked: "Americans are highly moralistic, and any kind of moral ambiguity irritates them. As a result they completely fail to understand themselves, which is one of their strengths." And this feels like inescapable truth: "The president of the United States bears about as much relationship to the real business of running America as does Colonel Sanders to the business of frying chicken."
442	 2016	a	Nadia Marie Gaya and Timothy McKenna Martin were married April 30 by the Rev. Ryan C. Fleenor, an Episcopal priest, who performed the ceremony at St. James’ Episcopal Church in Manhattan.The bride, 33, works in Manhattan as a senior consultant at Deloitte, where she focuses on tax accounting for insurance companies. She graduated from the University of Chicago, received a law degree from Loyola University of Chicago and a Masters of Laws in taxation from N.Y.U.

4213	 1995	a	This city is as dominated by one-party rule as any in the country. The registered Democrats in the nation's capital outnumber Republicans by more than 11 to 1, and even independents dwarf Republicans by nearly 2 to 1.That has kept Republicans out of most significant elected offices since local residents were given the right to elect their own leaders more than 20 years ago under a plan known as Home Rule. But as the city tries to climb out of a financial crisis that led to the creation of a financial control board in the spring, it has been a Republican, Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has played a leading role in resolving the city's management and fiscal problems.Acting as a buffer between House Republicans with ambitious ideas for reshaping local government and city officials who want to protect the limited autonomy they have, Mr. Gingrich has shepherded the factions along a path lined with political thorns.House Republicans, many of them acolytes of Mr. Gingrich, are eager to flex their muscles of fiscal conservatism by reversing years of overspending and questionable management practices. They have proposed such bedrock Republican notions as eliminating all financing for abortions as a condition of the city's winning its 1996 appropriation from Congress, a $660 million subsidy for taxes that are not paid by Government agencies, foreign embassies and not-for-profit institutions.

4109	 1995	a	Jeffrey Babcock, a founder of the New World Symphony in Miami and the director of the Cultural Olympiad, seems entirely comfortable with its mix of funk, flash, grit and show biz. "What we're doing is different than creating and presenting a free-standing independent arts festival," said Mr. Babcock, who was in Los Angeles with the Philharmonic when the 1984 Summer Olympics were held in that city. "Our mission is to enhance the overall Olympic experience, to be an important add-on component of the Games experience. You can't compare this with a festival like Spoleto."Similarly, Mr. Rifkin of the High Museum said he was not worried about the art world sniping at "Rings." "If people want to call it hokey, that's fine," he said. "I know there will be critics no matter what you do. But if it works to bring people to begin to see and appreciate works of art of different cultures it will be very successful. It's trying to be populist in spirit, and it's only because of the Olympics that we have the opportunity to do it."On the surface, art and athletics may not have much to do with each other, but in fact from the time of ancient Greece the Olympics have integrated sports and culture. The form has varied in recent years. In Los Angeles, a small group hired by the Olympic organizers put on the cultural festivities, which were criticized locally as lacking in community involvement. In Barcelona, Spain, organization of the Cultural Olympiad was kept entirely separate from that of the Olympics, as a way to enhance its artistic independence. But its organizers ran out of money six months before the Games started, and many people felt the cultural events that did take place were difficult to find.Atlanta has tried to involve as many people as possible from the city and regional art communities. And in keeping with its "run it like a business" civic ethic, it has taken a route opposite to that taken by Barcelona. Planning of the cultural programs is fully integrated into the planning of the Olympics, to such a degree that visitors will be able to buy a package that might include the javelin throw, women's basketball, the Atlanta Symphony and the Dallas Black Dance Theater.That approach has helped with fund-raising and efficiency, but it has at times led to clashes between the Olympic organizers and the local arts community. Many kinks have been ironed out, but some in Atlanta's arts world still see the organizers, including Billy Payne, the president of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, as intrusive micromanagers with no feeling for art."There's a narrowness of vision there," said one cultural figure who would only speak anonymously. "They see art as a dangerous business. It could be controversial."

2071	 2007	a	“I’d like to check you for ticks.”I was taking three days to drive from Florida to upstate New York last week when I heard that line coming out of the radio on the second day. On the first day I had done the respectable thing and searched the dial for NPR and classical music; but they were nowhere to be found after I left Savannah behind, and I was free to go where I always wanted to go anyway – to a country music station. You’re not going to come across a line like “I’d like to check you for ticks” anywhere else, and the same goes for an earlier line in the same Brad Paisley song, “You press that bottle to your lips and I wish I was your beer.”At first I had an academic thought: this is Petrarchanism updated, a modern day turn on the convention – perfected by Francis Petrarch and passed on to John Donne and many others – of putting yourself in the place of an inanimate object that enjoys an envied proximity to your beloved. But I shook off the pseudo-intellectualism (at least for the moment) and surrendered to a pleasure that gets along quite nicely without the support of hallowed antecedents.What is the pleasure? First of all, there is the sheer delight – self-indulgent, but earned – in the cleverness of the lyrics: “If I said you have a beautiful body, will you hold it against me? (It’s hard to imagine a neater instance of a purposefully ambiguous pronoun.) Where I’d like to be is “sitting next to you sitting next to me.” (The repetitions and alliterations mime the closeness the singer desires.) “I turn your picture to the wall when I’m lying next to her.” (Lying and lying.)The lyrics, arresting as they are, do not stand alone. Usually they anchor a story – the motto of one station I had on was “A story in every song” – and that story typically unfolds in a three act drama marked at the end of each act by a refrain that changes meaning with every repetition. A recent example is Emerson Drive’s “Moments.”In Act 1, the speaker tells us that at the end of a long walk, he was about to cross a bridge when an old homeless man asks him for change. He complies – he wouldn’t need it anyway, he remarks in an aside – and, clearly ashamed, the recipient of his charity declares, “I haven’t always been this way/ I’ve had my moments” — some of which he then recalls in a longish verse.In Act 2, it becomes clear (although it is never explicitly stated) that our narrator wasn’t going to cross the bridge; he intended to jump. But the homeless man, recognizing “that look in my eyes” just “kept hanging around”; and it is now the singer’s turn to be ashamed and to say, “You know I haven’t always felt this way / I’ve had my moments.”In Act 3, the singer, who has obviously lived to tell his tale, imagines the old man sitting “‘round a trash can fire” and once again rehearsing his moments … to which has now been added the moment “When a young man almost ended it / I was right there, wasn’t scared a bit / And I helped him to pull through / … I’ve had my moments.”Not startlingly original, and a bit O. Henryish, but nicely satisfying. After all, where else can you get wordplay, narrative structure, pathos, morality and a small dose of social consciousness in three minutes or less?You also get an entire culture or, rather, two. There is the culture of the country music industry itself, complete with a capital city (Nashville), a famous venue (the Grand Ole Opry), a roster of legends, several dynasties, celebrity marriages, nasty divorces, innumerable rags to riches stories, ostentatious displays of wealth – clothes, cars, jewels, mansions, theme parks. Then there is the culture country music describes and from which its stars all claim to have emerged – hardscrabble, hard-drinking, hard-playing and hard-praying.The emphasis is on family values and also on the many ways family values are eroded – by neglect, cheating, crime, poverty, illness, death. The dominant tone is an unapologetic celebration of country – life virtues (honesty, loyalty, friendship, piety) in the company of a nostalgia for the days, now vanished, when those virtues really flourished: She’s gone, “gone like a ’59 Cadillac, like all the good things that ain’t never coming back.” (You could say, if you were of a mind, that country music is a version of pastoral, a genre that foregrounds a landscape that is understood no longer to exist.)But if you enter, if only vicariously, into the country music culture, you have to swallow along with your enjoyment some stances and attitudes that might give you pause (or might not, depending on who you are).It’s a man’s world, even though a large number of the stars and superstars are women. In this world it is men who have the responsibilities and therefore the opportunities to default on them and then write a song about it. In those songs women, especially wives and mothers, are venerated, but it is the kind of veneration reserved for forms of behavior – patience, forbearance, steadfastness, chastity – the singer can’t quite get the hang of. Songs sung from the perspective of a woman are often angry; they are about betrayal and the hard road every woman will inevitably travel: “Sometimes it’s hard to be a woman” (Tammy Wynette); “Here’s to the liars and the cheaters and the cold mistreaters” (Danielle Peck).It’s a Christian world (and for “Christian” read “low Church Protestant”), where invocations of Jesus come as naturally as waking up in the morning. Think of it as Christian radio with all the sin left in. The religion is fierce and deep, and its consolations acknowledge the pain and trouble to which they are a not always adequate response: “God is great, but sometimes life ain’t good.”It’s a white world. Not racist; there is no minority bashing; there are just no minorities. (Yes, I know about Charlie Pride and Cowboy Troy. Point made.)It’s a patriotic world, given to flag-waving militarism, and distrustful of foreigners and their ways of life.It’s a world without ethnicity (except for the southern trailer-trash kind), and everyone’s name sounds like two or three bitten-off anglo-saxon syllables: George Strait, Clint Black, Travis Tritt, Johnny Cash, Randy Travis, Vince Gill, Trent Tomlinson. Many of the names could be reversed and they’d still work fine: Travis Randy, Tritt Travis, Paisley Brad, Gill Vince, Tomlinson Trent.It’s a “classist” world, with the favored class being lower middle, and the disfavored class being any with pretensions. “They raised her up a lady / But there’s one thing they couldn’t avoid, / Ladies love country boys” (Trace Adkins, or is it Adkins Trace?).And it is a world that knows everything I have just said about it, revels in it, and puts it all into the songs. Never has a popular music scene been so self-referential. The singers caress the history they spring from, rehearsing the litany of the great singers – Hank, Dolly, Patsy, Waylon, Loretta, Willie, Tammy – whose ranks they hope to join. (Another link to the pastoral; a pastoral poet always begins by invoking a long list of predecessors.)Of course, I wasn’t thinking about any of this while I was driving. I was listening to the music and accepting its pleasures, one of which was hearing Vince Gill and Dolly Parton sing Parton’s gloriously sentimental “I Will Always Love You” just as I crossed the Mason-Dixon line.
3803	 1997	a	In the modern annals of political warfare, no leader had been more effective than Yasir Arafat. He used its techniques and strategies to achieve major goals against an enemy far stronger militarily. But despite his successes, once again his character and ambitions have led Palestinians to the brink of disaster.The Arafat techniques include an international propaganda campaign that made much of the world accept as truth the fiction that a part of Jerusalem is already a city in itself, with an Arab majority, belonging to Palestinians by history and right. Arab Jerusalem, or East Jerusalem, they call it.Any action by Israel to defend its interests and sovereignty in that fictitious city, like opening a second door in an archeological tunnel or building apartments for Jews, is denounced by Mr. Arafat and countries around the world as provocation and justification for Arab riots and terrorist murders.Terrorism is a built-in part of Mr. Arafat's political warfare. The technique is to promise to give it up as a weapon against the Jews. Collect for the promise. Then break it when necessary to put more pressure on Israel. Make the promise again. Collect.
6133	 1977	a	ALBANY, Dec. 2—The burning of two ranger cabins in the Adirondack Moun tains by the State Department of Environmental Conservation as part of policy to eliminate man‐made objects from the wilderness has touched off furor among local residents.One called it “one of the most desgraceful acts of arson that has ever occurred within our wild forest country.”The destruction of the two cabins, to be followed by the burning of more by the end of the year, is in keeping with the state's Land Use Master Plan to restore wilderness areas to what they were before man first set toot in them.Implemention of the plan has already resulted in the removal of boat docks from some remote lakes, the closing of jeep and truck trails, the removal of leantos and the destruction of fire towers. Local residents contend that the cabins are important to the preservastion of, human life in the area.

5312	 1988	a	Mr. Jackson was also upset that a national voter registration program to which he thought Mr. Dukakis had agreed at the Atlanta convention was ''not in place'' and that Mr. Dukakis did not consult with him before his speech to a civil rights rally here Saturday.''What was missing in the speech,'' Mr. Jackson said in an interview with The New York Times, ''was he didn't mention D.C. statehood or set-asides or registration.'' He expressed a similar complaint on the ABC program. A Delicate RelationshipAll along, the Dukakis campaign has sought an arms-length relationship with Mr. Jackson, hoping his supporters will turn out for Mr. Dukakis but concerned that many white voters might be turned off if Mr. Jackson appears too close to the ticket. A certain amount of discord with Mr. Jackson has not been unwelcome in the Dukakis camp.Members of Mr. Dukakis's staff said they had conducted polling of Mr. Jackson's standing among voters in various states. Among the states Mr. Jackson was asked to steer clear of were Alabama, Mississippi and Michigan, except for Ann Arbor, home of the University of Michigan, Jackson advisers said. Mr. Jackson was also asked not to campaign for Mr. Dukakis in New York, where Mr. Jackson has been stumping for the last three days, or in Texas, the advisers said.Jack Corrigan, director of Mr. Dukakis's campaign operations, said a tentative schuedule for Mr. Jackson's fall campaigning on behalf of the ticket had been agreed to. In drafting it, he said, the priorities were picking places that ''make electoral sense'' and where there were large numbers of unregistered voters. ''Nobody ever said don't go someplace,'' Mr. Corrigan said.''I'm serving as a rather faithful volunteer,'' Mr. Jackson said. Had he expected more of a policy role? ''At this point, the policy makers for the most part are operating out of Boston,'' he replied. ''I accept my role as a volunteer for the campaign. Some people want to be more connected than they are. But that's up to the campaign. That's the campaign's responsibility and its challenge.'' Strains Partly PersonalThe strains between Mr. Jackson and Mr. Dukakis's campaign, Mr. Jackson's advisers said, are both personal and political. Politically, Mr. Jackson feels the Dukakis campaign is forsaking other constituencies through its intense focus on winning the support of moderate whites, many of them Democrats, who defected to Ronald Reagan in the past two elections. ''This obsession with retrieving Reagan Democrats,'' Mr. Jackson said, ''is leaving a bird in the hand unnurtured while pursuing birds in the Quayle.''

2630	 2004	a	United Airlines, which is trying to develop a restructuring plan to leave bankruptcy protection, said yesterday that it had identified $625 million in additional annual savings. The executive vice president, Peter D. McDonald, said the biggest savings, $200 million a year, would come from the maintenance department. United also wants to save $150 million a year on airport operations. Other savings will come from fuel, distribution, reservation centers and at the United Express regional carrier. United has said it will probably terminate its four employee pension plans and replace them with less-generous programs. United, a unit of the UAL Corporation, has warned employees to expect other cuts. Micheline Maynard (NYT)

1734	 2009	a	When I saw that Michelle Malkin will be on the Stephanopoulos panel this week, my first thought was that nobody as far to the left as she is to the right would ever appear on such a panel. But then I started to wonder (a) what I mean by that (b) if it’s true.I don’t want to be like Bill O’Reilly, who considers anyone he disagrees with a “far-left” activist. So we need some objective metric. The most natural would seem to be voter opinion: what fraction of the American public is to Malkin’s right? Would somebody with an equally small number of people to his or her left get on a Sunday morning panel?The trouble, of course, is how to measure that. In principle, it shouldn’t be hard. What I’d like to have is a Guttman scale of positions on political matters, such that almost everyone who gave the “liberal” answer to question 7 also gave liberal answers to questions 1-6, while almost everyone who gave the conservative answer to question 7 also gave conservative answers to questions 8-13. And we’d want population shares associated with each point on the scale. So we could then take known positions of public figures and place them on the scale: say, we might find that only 19 percent of Americans are to the right of Michelle Malkin, while 23 percent are to the left of Michael Moore.But if there are any such data available, I don’t know about them. Anyone care to put them together?
4695	 1992	a	Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has stumped the state and urged residents in radio ads to elect a State Legislature on Tuesday that would be packed to the rafters with third-party candidates from Mr. Weicker's own independent Connecticut Party.But there's a significant caveat: Most of the candidates that his party has endorsed and that will appear on its ballot line, which reads "A Connecticut Party," are not members of the party at all. Many say that if they win, they won't owe the Governor anything.So the question is, what's going on here?Is Mr. Weicker really building a permanent third party in Connecticut? Is he just endorsing candidates who may or may not need his help? Or is he really doing no more than building support for himself? Politics as Usual, He SaysMr. Weicker, for his part, has said he is only keeping promises. Mostly, he has endorsed candidates who supported him last year in his efforts to impose an income tax.

2432	 2005	a	To the Editor:Re "A Better Tower" (editorial, June 30):While I still think ground zero should be kept strictly as a memorial out of respect for those who lost their lives in the Sept. 11 attacks, I have to admit that the latest plans for the new Freedom Tower are looking more promising.The newly proposed Freedom Tower looks better. Its form is simpler, and it's easier on the eyes. The first proposed drawing of the Freedom Tower looked a little too tacky for an office building. More important, though, is the fact that the building was redesigned to be safer from any future terrorist attack.Whatever the actual final design for the former World Trade Center turns out to be, it seems only fair that it should have to be voted on and approved by the families of the 9/11 victims before it is actually built.Jerry T. Johnson Bloomington, Minn., June 30, 2005
6079	 1977	a	CREYS‐MALVILLE, France, July 31—A demonstrator was killed and at least 20 were injured in clashes with the police here today as 30,000 antinuclear protesters sought to invade the construction site of a fast‐breeder reactor.The police said that five officers had been wounded, including one whose hand was blown off while he was attempting to throw a tear‐gas grenade.According to the police, the demonstrator was killed when he was trampled by other protesters fleeing from tear gas.The demonstrators—most of them French youths but also contingents of West Germans, Belgians, Swiss and Scandinavians—marched in three large columns toward the reactor site, which was heavily guarded by 5,000 riot policemen, spread out in five security rings around a 10‐square‐mile area.

3102	 2001	a	The number of international terrorist attacks increased by 8 percent last year, largely because of a surge in bombings by two rebel groups in Colombia and attacks by paramilitary groups operating there, the State Department said today.South Asia remains the focal point for terrorism directed against the United States, the department's annual report on global terrorism said, with the Taliban in Afghanistan continuing to provide safe haven for international terrorists and Pakistan backing terrorist groups as well.Despite the concerns about Pakistan and Afghanistan, contained in the report for the second year in a row, they were not added to the list of nations accused of state-sponsored terrorism. Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria have long held that designation, which brings with it strict sanctions.The report is based on data collected in the final year of the Clinton administration, but officials said the Bush administration had ample time to review and change the report, and therefore it represents the first view of global terrorism under the new administration.

1836	 2008	a	Re “What That McCain Article Didn’t Say” (Feb. 24):The beauty of the Feb. 21 front-page article about Senator John McCain is that it was constructed in such a way that The New York Times could go either way with it, depending on how the public responded.If the public bought in, the paper could leverage the impact with expanded editorial and Op-Ed coverage. If the public thought it was a lot of hooey, which they did, they could go to Plan B and send the public editor into the fray to apologize for any misunderstanding and point out that the story did not actually say what it was intended to suggest.Either way, The Times would keep alive a story that the public correctly recognized as insubstantial.Margaret McGirrGreenwich, Conn., Feb. 25, 2008Why assume that the volume of correspondence on a particular topic automatically reflects the “consensus” opinion of all Times readers? It’s not necessarily that “most readers saw it as … ,” but rather that most writers to The Times and you “saw it as …”The Times has had plenty of front-page coverage of embarrassing disclosures about Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton. Where was the reader or public editor outrage on those?I’m assuming The Times didn’t make up the concern by Senator John McCain’s advisers over the appearance of impropriety in his relationship with a female lobbyist. Their concern factually existed. The Times reported those facts. Where is the controversy?The Times didn’t say Mr. McCain had an affair. It said his advisers repeatedly confronted him with their concerns. Any aftermath to this story should be limited to whether his staff members did or did not have such concerns. If they did, Mr. McCain and his supporters need to accept the facts of the situation.Ajoy VachherNew York, Feb. 24, 2008●Until you hit the paragraph beginning “The pity of it is that, without the sex, The Times was on to a good story,” you were doing your job superbly. But that particular paragraph is a cheap retelling of the story. Since you did not uncover it, and are not a political opinion editor, you should not, in my opinion, be airing it at all.Paul B. KantorNew Brunswick, N.J., , Feb. 24, 2008●Bravo for your report on the McCain article. Alas, it’s not going to weigh as heavily in the public’s mind as the original article.I am really contemptuous of the self-serving statements that Bill Keller, the executive editor, has issued in response to the outcry. He’s trying to justify the unjustifiable. If anyone thought The Times was wrong in the first place, Mr. Keller really drove the point home.Peter A. LakeMarblehead, Mass., Feb. 24, 2008●Your column had it exactly right, but the question remains why individuals with such shockingly deficient journalistic standards remain employed by The Times.Jordan RubinsteinFairfax, Va., Feb. 24, 2008●I continue to be bemused by what seems to me the overwhelming misreading of The Times’s Feb. 21 article on John McCain. The idea that Mr. McCain alarmed his aides by misjudgments with regard to “appearances” seems completely plausible and in no way constitutes an allegation of actual misbehavior.Linda FitchPrinceton, N.J., Feb. 24, 2008●Your column about the John McCain article was more harmful than beneficial. You reinforced the idea that there was fire behind the smoke, again without any evidence. After months of research by four reporters, this was a good story?An undefined “complex relationship” is not a good story. It may be a potential subject for a story, but without any kind of evidence other than insinuation and innuendo, there is no story. When The Times reports by innuendo, many people believe that there is something behind the innuendo.The Times will be able to sell its credibility like this for political purposes for a while, but not for very long. Any good work the Times could do in the future, as it has sometimes in the past, is tainted.D. F. HayesBrooklyn, Feb. 25, 2008●I read the John McCain article the day it appeared, before reading any of the backlash that followed. I did not take it to mean he had an affair, I took it to mean what it said, that his aides thought he might be having an affair and were concerned about the appearance.I thought the article was clear about what was known (aides were concerned), what was not known (whether he had an affair) and that there was no evidence of anything more than friendship.Kudos to The Times reporters who wrote the fine piece. Nothing in the article will change my decision to vote for Mr. McCain if, as everyone now expects, he is the Republican candidate.Fred WallaceChetumal, Mexico, Feb. 25, 2008●Nothing helps a newspaper’s credibility more than honest reflection in its own pages and an assessment that an important piece was not executed flawlessly. Your column struck a blow for the betterment of the industry.Daniel ClemensEllicott City, Md., Feb. 25, 2008●I read the original Feb. 21 article with quite some dismay on the day it was published. I have followed the furor that has ensued, and have read with particular interest the questions submitted online by readers and the responses from Bill Keller and the news editors.The questions posed by the readers were intelligent, insightful and pointed. The responses from the editors were defensive, sloppy and off the point.Surely the senior editors of The Times realize that when they put an incendiary accusation of sexual misbehavior in the second paragraph of a front-page article, readers will focus almost exclusively on that issue. This was a scandalous statement more fitting for The National Enquirer, and it was spotted as such by the readers.If it makes any difference, I am a Democrat who supports the efforts of Barack Obama.Ted BiaginiSan Jose, Calif., Feb. 25, 2008●I am a retired editor of two Scripps Howard newspapers and was in the business for 34 years. The Feb. 21 article on John McCain (I am not a McCain supporter) is one of the most egregious and irresponsible stories that I have ever read in any newspaper. I was shocked that The New York Times, of all papers, would publish it.It is an embarrassment to the profession. The responses of the executive editor, Bill Keller, and other editors to your commentary on this story were nothing but overly defensive hogwash.Tom KingKnoxville, Tenn., Feb. 25, 2008●I will leave it to the experts as to when a story meets the proper standards for publication. But if Senator John McCain maintained a close friendship with a lobbyist and used his influence on behalf of her clients, I would prefer to know about it than not.It seems as though that aspect of the story was not incorrect and properly bears on the election this year.Moreover, if a personal relationship between the senator and the lobbyist was the concern of the Mr. McCain adviser who was a Times source and there was no particular reason to doubt that adviser, then it was fair to report that fact.The whole issue of unnamed sources is an interesting one in reporting, yet sometimes it seems the only way to get to the facts.Early in the article, both Senator McCain and the lobbyist were reported as denying having had any romantic relationship. The thrust of the article was clearly about the senator engaging in possible conflicts of interest.Bruce NeumanSag Harbor N.Y., Feb. 25, 2008●More than anything, the McCain story reminds me of the CBS National Guard story about President Bush in 2004. Both stories were around for years.Both relied on questionable sources and shaky evidence. Both were kept alive by media outlets long after their shelf life had expired, and both, if true, were less important than either CBS or The Times claimed them to be. And both had as their target Republican presidential candidates.Why did The Times pursue the McCain story for so long? The Times was not overly concerned with Bill Clinton’s fitness for president in the wake of his affair with Gennifer Flowers. And The Times reported zero evidence of special favors from John McCain to the clients of the lobbyist his advisers were “convinced” he was having a “romantic” relationship with.Mark R. GodburnNorth Canaan, Conn., Feb. 26, 2008●Jill Abramson, the managing editor for news, justifies passing off some smelly old news of an assumed indiscretion by Senator John McCain that took place in 1999 as a current happening by saying that omitting it “would not have reflected the essential truth of why the aides were alarmed.”You note that the Feb. 21 article was about something that happened “during McCain’s first run for the White House eight years ago.” Is that news?And the rehashing of Mr. McCain’s long-ago ethical slip during this current campaign has the earmarks of a “gotcha” story and a platform to regurgitate Mr. McCain’s “poor judgment” in intervening with federal regulators during the savings and loan bank investigations.The Times need not worry so much about being the first as it should about being correct.Al PorteMinneapolis, Feb. 24, 2008●It seems you want The Times to dumb down its coverage. I, for one, totally buy what Bill Keller and Jill Abramson and other Times writers have said regarding why they went ahead with the Feb. 21 article on John McCain.For understanding, patient people, all that needed to be said was said. There was no reason at all for anyone to come away from that article thinking that John McCain must have had an affair with the lobbyist Vicki Iseman.But yes, perception matters. And that is what The Times editors have been insisting on.Please, encourage patience and encourage literacy.Mark Stephen CaponigroNew York, Feb. 25, 2008●Thanks for restoring my faith in The New York Times, which was badly shaken by the Feb. 21 feature on John McCain.I was one of the 2,400 letter writers you mention in your column. It’s nice to know that the ombudsman’s role is working under your watch, particularly after the failure by two key editors, Bill Keller and Jill Abramson.I’ll bet it got a little hot in the kitchen this week.Charles DeRoseNorthampton, Mass., Feb. 24, 2008●When I read the Feb. 21 front-page article, I did not get the sense that it was in any way suggesting that John McCain might have actually had an affair or that that was important. The prurience in this case is purely in the eyes of thousands of emotional and cynical readers who need to learn how to read newspaper articles more objectively.I am very glad that the attitude of the advisers to Mr. McCain was described by the article, both because it is factual and because it indicates the seriousness with which Mr. McCain’s aides took the situation. It would have been more politically astute for the article to have simply omitted the fears of an affair felt by the aides. That would have been easy. But it would have been a loss for people who want to have objective information about the hidden world of lobbyists and how they affect our politicians and government.Your conclusion gave in to the forces of silence. Let The New York Times publish many more fearless articles like the one on Mr. McCain!Chris DrakeHatoyama-machi, Japan, Feb. 24, 2008●Your column about the reaction from the public to the Feb. 21 front-page article about Senator John McCain deals with the reason the reporters and editors decided to include the romantic aspect of the story. As you point out, that isn’t the real substance of the article, and you go on to state about Mr. McCain’s dealing with lobbyists that “it was still worth pulling together to help voters in 2008 better understand the John McCain who might be their next president.”Yet you leave out the background and facts that the initial story did, instead of helping the reader decide where the truth lies.Chris MasucciMilford, N.H., Feb. 24, 2008●You suggest that The Times was on to a good story, absent the relationship component. I disagree; The Times was on to a good Op-Ed piece, not a good news story. And most certainly not a front-page story.The Times has unfortunately repeated Dan Rather’s mistake from the 2004 election. It went with a story before it had the facts.Frederick SchaeferFairfield, Conn., Feb. 26, 2008●●Re “The Doctors Are In. The Jury Is Out.” (Feb. 17):I was startled by your juxtaposition of the topics of mercury in tuna (it affects adults) and mercury in vaccines (it doesn’t affect babies). But something’s missing. We know that mercury toxically affects all living things. Even if we buy that it has nothing to do with autism spectrum disorders, why wouldn’t it cause neurotoxic damage to babies at least as much as it does to adults? After all, the babies are still developing.What would that affect look like? How would it manifest?While I’m willing to not call it autism, what is the name that we can give it? What’s being done to help those children with their unnamed (unacknowledged?) mercury damage?Don’t you see a disconnect here? I do.Anne Van RensselaerNew York, Feb. 19, 2008●As the mother of three children, one of whom has autism, I hope that you will learn more about the vaccine-autism controversy for yourself.I believe that many intelligent people would draw the same conclusions about vaccine safety that I have if they learned more about the issue beyond what is being reported in the mainstream press and by agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The C.D.C., the F.D.A. and other organizations and agencies have a vested interest in denying problems with vaccines. At the same time as thimerosal has (we hope) been reduced in vaccines, the number of vaccines continues to increase, from 10 in 1983 to 36 in 2008 on the C.D.C.’s schedule. The cumulative effect of so many vaccines has not been studied.Do we really know what we are doing to the developing immune systems of babies when we give them 36 vaccines, 29 of them by the age of 2?The door on this controversy is not closing! It is opening wider and wider.Twyla RamosGlendale, Calif., Feb. 19, 2008●I appreciate your comments on the difficult issue of how laymen, including journalists, can evaluate conflicting medical research.As a writer on health care policy, I am always taking a very opinionated view on policy issues, but I have to work hard to avoid straying into medical issues or evaluation of treatments in which I have no competence.It is good to see that someone at The New York Times is alert to the importance of this.Richard E. RalstonExecutive DirectorAmericans for Free Choice in MedicineNewport Beach, Calif., Feb. 17, 2008●I am glad that you looked into the important topic of a possible connection between childhood vaccines and the alarming increase in autism among children.But thimerosal was not “removed from children’s vaccines in 2001.” While levels of mercury were reduced, they were not eliminated from most such vaccines produced after 2001. And those containing the full dose of mercury were never recalled and remained in use, perhaps through 2004 or even later.Mercury remains in full force in flu vaccines given to infants and pregnant women, so fetuses and infants continue to be exposed to mercury in these shots, in addition to the mercury they breathe and eat.Mercury is a powerful neurotoxin. The Environmental Protection Agency considers mercury to be toxic and dangerous at levels found now in many fish and in the air in some locations. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has for years widely promoted mercury-containing children’s vaccines and flu shots for youngsters and pregnant women, and continues to do so. One of the agencies has to be wrong.It cannot be that mercury is harmful in fish and air, but not when injected into human bodies. Why keep using our children as human guinea pigs ?Lewis RegensteinAtlanta, Ga., Feb. 17, 2008The writer is the author of books about health and the environment.●It is true that many authorities discount the effects of mercury on incidences of autism, but there are many who concede that the disconnect is not clear.You state, “Thimerosal, the preservative in question, was removed from children’s vaccines in 2001.” But some vaccines still contain trace amounts of Thimerosal. While some may regard this as insignificant, I would note that there may be no threshold level of exposure to mercury that is absolutely safe.Robert A. IadiciccoOak Bluffs, Mass., Feb. 18, 2008●I was disappointed in your comments about fibromyalgia. As a professional who works in social services, I have seen both clients and staff who suffer from this very real and painful disease.One client, a very positive, intelligent woman with many health issues, says that her fibromyalgia is by far the most difficult thing she has to deal with. I can’t schedule her in the mornings, as she often cannot move.I also have a good friend who deals with this on a regular basis, and it has affected his life so much that he has been unable to continue in his line of work.Remember that just a few years ago, many diseases — including some mental illnesses — were not thought to be as varied and real as they truly are.Fibromyalgia is a very real disease that is just now being realized and researched to the level it should be.Caryl HunterMinneapolis, Feb. 19, 2008●The problem with the Jan. 14 fibromyalgia article, and your assessment, is that some diseases, like multiple sclerosis, have no test to determine whether a patient has that disease.These diseases are diagnosed by a set of observable criteria, and many patients show no medical evidence at all of their suffering, except the obvious development of the disease.While there are supportive comments regarding fibromyalgia in the article, the negative comments are far more opinionated. It’s quite clear what the reporter believes.Seth KaplanBrooklyn, Feb. 20, 2008●●Re “Fuzzy Election Math, Before and After” (Feb. 10, 2008):You quote Janet Elder, the editor in charge of polling, as saying that “we are much more conservative in allocating delegates than everyone else is.” I would use a different word: I’d say that The Times’s policy is, clearly, prudent.Joe ConnollyNorwich, N.Y., Feb. 10, 2008●I applaud The Times’s stringent counting of delegate votes that excludes nonbinding votes for candidate preference, such as those resulting from caucuses.But then why does The Times include a survey of superdelegates in some of its charts of delegate totals? Aren’t these superdelegates the most nonbinding votes of all? The inclusion of superdelegates clouds the intent to provide the most accurate and unbiased assessment of tallied votes.Craig NiederbergerChicago Feb. 12, 2008●I’ve complained in the past about what I felt was The Times’s incomplete summary of delegates awarded. But having just looked at the online chart of the Democratic delegate count , I found that this summary addressed all the issues I raised and added even more information by giving estimates from the candidates and The Associated Press.Bravo!Bob CollinsNewport News, Va., Feb. 14, 2008●There are two logically consistent, intellectually defensible ways of reporting counts of delegates:Report only counts of pledged delegates, omitting estimates of caucus-state delegates and estimates of superdelegates. Or, report counts of pledged delegates, estimates of caucus-state delegates and estimates of superdelegates.A responsible news organization either reports no estimates or reports all estimates. A responsible news organization does not pick and choose which estimates to report.The approach used by The Times is not “conservative.” It is unsound. It systematically overstates support for Hillary Rodham Clinton.In view of the fact that the editorial board of The Times has endorsed Mrs. Clinton, it is difficult to escape the impression that the counting approach used by The Times is designed expressly to overstate support for Mrs. Clinton.Richard H. EbrightNorth Brunswick, N.J., Feb. 10, 2008●The delegate count on The Times’s Web site is completely unfair and biased toward Hillary Rodham Clinton. The chart I saw today gives the impression that Mrs. Clinton has a strong lead in the delegate count, when she is in fact behind in pledged delegates, and barely ahead if you also include superdelegates.The Times says it has chosen to exclude all the caucus results because they haven’t been set in stone at the state primaries yet, but yet it includes the unpledged superdelegates, based on its own polling. The superdelegate count isn’t any more certain than the caucus count.The Times should either include both caucus and superdelegates in its total, or neither. The best way to do it would be to have two counts, one for pledged delegates and one for superdelegates, so everyone can see who is actually ahead in the popular vote count, and who is ahead among party insiders.By confusing the two, The Times is enabling Democratic National Committee insiders to throw the election to Mrs. Clinton, even if Barack Obama wins a majority of pledged delegates. Such dishonesty shouldn’t be allowed for something as important as our presidential election.Silvia GederbergHouston, Feb. 10, 2008
5698	 1985	a	New Zealand's Prime Minister said today that the United States wants to drive him from office because of his antinuclear policy and is using tactics ''akin to the very totalitarianism we're supposed to be fighting against.''The Prime Minister, David Lange, whose Labor Government has been in office seven months, was reacting at a news conference to what he called a ''whole range of countermeasures'' by the United States, ''including a failure to exercise in land, sea and air and a cutoff in intelligence sources.''WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 (AP) - The State Department has told New Zealand there will be no cutoff in sales of American military equipment, New Zealand's Ambassador, Wallace Rowling, said today.
5419	 1987	a	Between them, Rainer Crone and Elizabeth Ferrer of the Columbia faculty persuaded Professor Schapiro to let them show 65 of his paintings and drawings in the Wallach Gallery. Even if we know that his first teacher was John Sloan, there is something remarkable about the forthrightness of the self-portrait drawing that he made when he was 16. As for the two portrait drawings of Whittaker Chambers, whom he knew well in 1923, they have a bite and a grip that are astonishing for someone who was barely 19 at the time.Meyer Schapiro has always been around artists, and from Max Weber and Stuart Davis to Barnett Newman, Donald Judd and R. B. Kitaj, they have prized his company. When with them, he had a rare gift for the unexpected push in the right direction. We know from the late Thomas B. Hess, whose essay of 1978 is reprinted in the catalogue, that as an exile in New York during World War II, Fernand Leger was delighted to be introduced by Professor Schapiro to the ''Beatus Apocalypse'' in the Morgan Library, with its ''background shapes of intense color bounded by crisp edges'' that Leger soon adapted to his own uses. And it was he, in 1952, who was able to persuade Willem de Kooning that ''Woman I'' was not a failure, as de Kooning had supposed, but a success from which other successes were sure to come.Given a record of this kind, and given the diffidence with which Professor Schapiro regards his own activity as an artist, it should surprise no one that the works in his show -most of them small - are gentle and ruminative in character, and touch on a whole gamut of idioms. (There is even a study after a drawing by Seurat that would deceive many a layman. Matisse is there, too, in a drawing of Mrs. Schapiro done in 1932.) There are landscape studies (note the tall clouded sky in ''Glebe Mountain'') and cityscapes (note the deft placement and the beauty of tone in ''Riverside Park, New York, Near the West 80's''). Family subjects play a large part in the show, and often bring out a freedom of color and a lightness of touch that speak for the pleasure with which they were done. And as Professor Schapiro has always been hypersensitive to political developments, it is natural that before and during World War II there are imaginative subjects (''Furious Monsters,'' for one, and ''Apocalypse Over Manhattan'' for another, not to mention ''War'' and ''War and Peace'') that touch on the terrors of the day.There are some very good later portraits, and there are abstractions that have both weight and resolution. But then, nothing that comes from Meyer Schapiro's hand - whether written, drawn or painted - can leave us indifferent. The show is open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 1 to 5 P.M., through May 23, and it is best reached from the university entrance at Broadway and 116th Street. Jean Dubuffet Wildenstein & Company 19 East 64th Street Through May 29 Pace Gallery 42 West 57th Street Through May 30From the moment in 1946 when his work was first presented by the Pierre Matisse Gallery, New York has never been short of Dubuffet exhibitions. Readers may wonder, therefore, why we should need yet another large retrospective - spread, this time, over two galleries, with the earlier work at Wildenstein's and the later work at the Pace Gallery. Shouldn't he be given a rest? How many more of those relentless jigsaws do we have to decipher?

1646	 2009	a	The Ad Bowl inside Super Bowl XLIII ended with a fourth quarter with almost as many surprises as in the football game.Through the first three quarters, the commercials appeared pretty much as they were expected based on pregame lineups compiled by reporters. But in the second commercial break of the fourth quarter, along came a spot for the Vizio brand of TV sets, which had not been on radar screens before Sunday.Most of the changes were made by PepsiCo, which dropped a planned 15-second commercial for SoBe Lifewater and added a 60-second spot for Pepsi-Cola. The Pepsi commercial featured characters from a sketch on “Saturday Night Live” called “MacGruber,” which parodies the old ABC series “MacGyver.”What was strange about the additional Pepsi spot was that the episode of “Saturday Night Live” broadcast by NBC on Saturday — the night before the Super Bowl — included several “MacGruber” sketches centered on MacGruber’s selling out to Pepsi-Cola so completely that he tells his friends he wants to be known as “PepSuber.”In fact, the Pepsi commercial in the game seemed like a shorter version of that skit. It may turn out to be one of the most audacious plays in the history of product placement, branded entertainment and blurring the line between entertainment and advertising.PepsiCo also dropped a couple of other commercials that it had indicated it was going to run in the game: one for Pepsi Max and one for Gatorade. Each of those brands was originally going to get two spots apiece; they had to settle for one apiece.Another change that took place in the fourth quarter was a decision by General Electric to run two spots instead of one. The second spot, about wind energy, had appeared previously; the first spot, for G.E.’s SmartGrid technology, was new.(Of course, G.E. had some extra clout to change its corporate mind since it owns NBC, the network that broadcast the game.)For the record, here is a preliminary look at the commercial rundown: 11 spots shown nationally during the first quarter, 19 in the second quarter, 10 in the third quarter and 11 in the fourth quarter.As usually happens, the final commercials of the game came around the two-minute warning in the fourth quarter. Although with a contest so close to the end, perhaps a few advertisers wished they had scheduled spots deeper into the game.Next up for fans of Super Bowl ads are the postgame polls and surveys, which will start on Monday morning to offer assessments of the hits and flops.It is always risky to go out on a limb on Super Bowl Sunday night and predict which spots viewers are saying they like or dislike, what they will want to watch again online or avoid at all costs. But here are some guesses.Among the commercials that may vie for the top ranks are the Budweiser commercial celebrating love between two horses; the CareerBuilder.com spot offering sardonic advice on job-hunting; the Bud Light commercial with Conan O’Brien mocking celebrities who endorse products abroad; the Coke Zero spot that parodies the famous Mean Joe Greene commercial for Coca-Cola; the Hulu.com commercial featuring Alec Baldwin as a fiendish alien; and the Coca-Cola commercial set in a park, which depicts insects heisting a human’s Coke bottle.Among the spots that may fall short in the postgame results are the spots for GoDaddy.com, which could prove problematic to female viewers; a spot for H&R Block that features Death, who is rarely welcome at Super Bowl parties; a commercial for Pepsi Max replete with cartoonish violence; and several of the spots for movies, which offered few reasons to buy tickets to the films being advertised.
3602	 1998	a	Premium cigars are not the only ones with rising demand, said Mr. Jean, whose firm helped take 800-JR Cigar public last June. Sales of mass-market cigars, which cost less than $1 each, are also growing, he said, and industry analysts say the same is true for middle-market smokes ($1 to $3).With such strong demand, Mr. Jean and many of his peers are convinced that cigar smoking won't just be a fad like Pet Rocks or bell-bottom pants. Also, he said, there is the fast growth of the prime market for cigar smoking -- men in their 40's and 50's. This age group will increase by 3.7 million people in the next three years alone.Mr. Lurito also points to the past as proof that cigar smoke will not dissipate fast. ''Every time there's been an uptick in cigars over the past 30 to 40 years, it's tended to last 7 to 10 years,'' he said. ''I've looked at the numbers and they look credible.''Also, the recent price declines in cigar stocks may have made them bargains.The four largest companies are trading at 9.5 to 13.8 times their estimated 1998 earnings per share. Yet, with demand surging, the earnings of all these enterprises are expected to grow at an attractive 25 to 30 percent a year for the next three to five years. These are mouth-watering disparities: A stock is often considered attractive if its price-earnings ratio is moderately less than expected earnings growth.Which cigar stocks look best?For investors interested in the flagship part of the market -- premium smokes -- General Cigar is a logical bet. It gets about 60 percent of its revenues from its Macanudos, Partagas and other premium cigars, which are presumably less vulnerable to price competition than middle- and mass-market varieties. And its brands are strong: Macanudos, for instance, is the country's biggest premium seller.The fortunes of Swisher International are more price-sensitive -- only 10 percent of its revenues come from premium cigars -- but the company offers diversity. It sells cigars in all price ranges, as well as ''little'' cigars and smokeless tobacco. Combined with strong brand names, like King Edward and Optimo, its product range can mean a more balanced revenue stream -- a plus in an industry where the future is hazy.Mr. Lurito's fund has been buying more shares of Consolidated Cigar, the industry's largest company with $299 million in 1997 sales. Consolidated has a strong presence in the premium market, which supplies 45 percent of its revenues, and it owns famous brands like Don Diego, Dutch Masters and El Producto.

7464	 1964	a	The Illinois outcome, although not unexpected, was viewed by many political observers as con­solidating Mr. Goldwater's large lead for the Presidential nomi­nation at the convention open­ing July 13 in San Francisco.The Senate Republican leader, Everett McKinley Dirksen, who is chairman of the delegation, announced the results of the poll. He said that he himself had voted for Mr. Goldwater, along with the Republican gov­ernorship candidate, Charles H. Percy, a moderate.He was asked why he had so voted, and answered, “Why, be­cause I wanted to.”Television station WNBQ, the Chicago outlet of the National Broadcasting Company, report­ed tonight that Senator Dirksen had been asked whether he nominate Senator Gold­water at the convention. The station said Senator Dirksen re­plied that if he were asked to do so he would consider doing it.The candidates met with the Illinois delegates in private.Mr. Goldwater, at a wild and shouting news conference, his first in a month, called the ac­tion “very significant” and said he was “very happy about it.”He declined, however, to pre­dict that he now had the Re­publican Presidential nom­ination sewed up.“I wouldn't say so definitely,” Mr. Goldwater said. “If you wanted to bet me, you would need to give some odds.”Flies to MichiganMr. Goldwater later flew to Lansing to appear before the Michigan delegation. This was not a strong area for him. He claims eight delegates; the As­sociated Press delegate poll re­cently gave him only two, and Governor Romney has been critical of his conservative views.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyMr. Goldwater was met at the airport by about 500 per­sons, most of them cheering admirers, but there were some hecklers. One carried a sign saying: “You shall not crucify mankind on a cross of Gold­water.”Governor Romney personally seemed as cool as ever toward Mr. Goldwater's candidacy. He said he was “not entirely satis­fied” with Mr. Goldwater's an­swers to questions, especially on civil rights, collective bargain­ing and foreign policy.Mr. Goldwater said he now believed he had about 690 con­vention votes, “or something along in there.” A total of 655 is needed to nominate.But Mr. Goldwater, conscious that there could be defections, said he would “like a few more as a pad to get me over the hump.”Mr. Goldwater told the news conference that he would de­finitely “uphold” and enforce the civil rights bill if elected President.Reminded that he had said that genuine enforcement would demand the creation of a police state, he said he was “afraid” that the nation was “going to have a police state—I don't like that.”But he said anyone serving as President under the bill would have to “accept increases of the police forces on a Federal level.”“I hope to God civil rights doesn't get into the campaign,” Mr. Goldwater said when asked if he thought the action of the Iilinois delegation proved that his vote against the civil rights bill would not hurt him in the industrial Northern states.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyMr. Dirksen said that Gov­ernor Scranton, who addressed the Illinois delegation after Mr. Goldwater had done so, had made a “very excellent and pointed talk and made quite an impression.”Goldwater Aide BuoyedRichard Kleindienst, co‐direc­tor of field operations for Mr. Goldwater, said the poll of the Illinois delegation and the de­cision of the Ohio delegation to back a favorite son “al­most precludes the possibility of success for the stop‐Gold­water movement.”He said that some “break for Scranton in one of those two states is almost a necessity to stop Goldwater,” but that this had not happened.The Ohio delegation voted June 22 to cast its 58 votes on the first ballot for Gov. James A. Rhodes as a favorite son.Mr. Goldwater appears to dis­like, even when he is winning, the extreme bustle of a meet­ing like that of the Illinois del­egation, which took place at the O'Hare Inn near the Chi­cago airport.He had to be hustled through masses of his backers, chanting “We want Barry,” in the hotel and past persistent newsmen. he emerged from meet­ing the delegation, photograph­ers shouted for him to make a victory sign.“Don't tell me how to pose,”This article can be viewed in its original form.

1457	 2010	a	He also wrote and illustrated a series of children’s books starring Sally, a Labrador retriever. Among them is “Sally Goes to the Beach” (Abrams, 2000), which appeared briefly on the New York Times children’s best-seller list.He was the subject of a book, “The Art of Stephen Huneck” (Abrams, 2004), by Laura Beach.Mr. Huneck’s masterwork was the Dog Chapel, which he began building in 1997. It sits on Dog Mountain, a vast park-like space he and his wife owned near St. Johnsbury. Dog Mountain, which is open to the public at no charge, includes a gallery, hiking trails and an agility course for dogs.Small, modest and white, the chapel resembles a 19th-century New England church from the outside, apart from the steeple topped by a winged Labrador. A sign proclaims: “Welcome: All Creeds, All Breeds. No Dogmas Allowed.”Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

The walls are almost entirely covered with handwritten notes to departed pets, placed there by grieving visitors.“I’ve learned so much more about love from my dogs than I ever did from my parents or the church,” Mr. Huneck told The Chicago Tribune in 1997. “They’re really great teachers. They love you with their whole heart.”Stephen Huneck was born on Oct. 8, 1948, in Columbus, Ohio, and reared in Sudbury, Mass. (The family name is pronounced HYOO-neck.) Severely dyslexic and unhappy in a home he described afterward as turbulent, he left at 17 “with 33 cents in his pocket,” his wife said.Mr. Huneck later studied at the Massachusetts College of Art, before becoming an antiques dealer. Through repairing wooden pieces, he taught himself how to carve. In 1984, one of his original carvings caught the eye of a New York dealer, and he was soon making art full time.In addition to his wife, the former Gwendolyn Ide, Mr. Huneck is survived by his parents, five sisters and a brother.Two books written and illustrated by Mr. Huneck, “Sally’s Great Balloon Adventure” and “Even Bad Dogs Go to Heaven,” are scheduled to be published by Abrams this year.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyOf Mr. Huneck’s network of galleries, only the one on Dog Mountain remains. The fate of Dog Mountain, the chapel and the gallery is uncertain, Ms. Huneck said. But with the renewed demand for her husband’s work that his death has engendered, she said, she was able to hire back most of the employees let go last month.

4194	 1995	a	A totally new screen design begins with a desktop even less useful than the one on the Mac, whose icons, folders and document orientation have been "borrowed," lock, stock and subdirectory. Desktop icons let you explore files on My Computer and in the Network Neighborhood. You can also click on a Recycle Bin, where deleted files are stored until you empty them; a Briefcase, which lets you pack files for travel; an electronic Inbox, which stores your mail and faxes, and, unless the Justice Department intervenes, the Microsoft Network on-line service.The Start button at the bottom left of the screen launches a list of programs and documents. A Taskbar beside it shows what programs are currently running and is supposed to be visible at all times. But in just one of many maddening inconsistencies, multimedia programs often make the Taskbar mysteriously disappear.User interfaces are highly personal. I found this one an improvement over Windows 3.1 but persistently irritating nonetheless. How do you call up a directory of your files? Click My Computer or Windows Explorer, which work quite differently from one another. There are many disparate ways to do things as simple as copying a file, but none works quite the way you expect it to, at least not until you discover the formerly dormant right mouse button. Where is the Shut Down option? On the Start button, of course!You get used to these oddities. Windows 95 lets you customize look and feel to a fare-thee-well and adds useful features like a "find" utility, which helps track down files across multiple drives and directories. But unlike OS/2 Warp, the system can get befuddled if you delete or rename certain files.As noted here on June 20, Windows 95 lets you use long file names like Letter to an Unknown Woman, but also truncates them into old-style "8-dot-3" directory entries like LETTER 1.DOC. The ability to use long file names, available on the Mac since 1984, is long overdue; unfortunately, current application software cannot view or manipulate them, and sending them across networks or to DOS or Windows 3.1 systems adds special problems. You cannot avoid them even if you want to: Windows 95 stores many of its own files under the new scheme.Programs like Quicken and Turbotax handle few user-named files. But with most programs, the right but costly answer to the long-file-name perplex is to buy new software designed for Windows 95. Upgraded utility software is crucial. Current backup software, for example, cannot save long file names, and the inadequate Windows 95 backup program crashed repeatedly on my system.Early tests of final versions here and in the July 24 issue of PC Week confirm that Windows 95 does not run current programs faster; if anything, it tends to slow them down a bit. In actual use, pluses and minuses seem randomly mixed. On my system, multimedia benchmark programs indicated significantly improved CD-ROM performance, but loading Encarta took nearly twice as long as it did before.
3819	 1997	a	A 19-year-old student was shot and critically wounded during a dispute outside an alternative high school in lower Manhattan yesterday, the police said.The victim, Cornelius Ray, was shot once in the chest about 12:30 P.M. on the steps of City-as-School, which houses three specialized high school programs in its building at 16 Clarkson Street in the West Village. It was not known whether the gunman, described as an 18-year-old man wearing a black jacket with a red design, was a student at the school, said Officer Martin Foley, a police spokesman.The gunman escaped. Mr. Ray, a resident of the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, was taken to St. Vincent's Hospital, where he was in critical but stable condition after undergoing surgery. Jayne Greene, a hospital spokeswoman, said doctors said Mr. Ray was doing well.Karen Crowe, a spokeswoman for the Board of Education, said Mr. Ray was enrolled in the Lower Manhattan Outreach Project, a program for students older than 16 1/2 who had dropped out of school or were at risk of dropping out.

4637	 1992	a	To the Editor:"Sister Souljah Is No Willie Horton" (editorial, June 17) indicates that Sister Souljah was calling for violence against whites and praises Gov. Bill Clinton for condemning her statement in a speech to the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition.In the same issue, "Rapper, Chided by Clinton, Calls Him a Hypocrite" (news article) indicates that Sister Souljah's statement was in response to a "question about the views of those who committed the violence":"Did they think it was wise? Was that wise, reasoned action?"While Sister Souljah's answer may not have been artful, it is clear that she was attempting to convey the thinking of those who committed the violence in Los Angeles, who thought nothing of killing blacks or whites.I am fearful that you did what so many white Americans, including Mr. Clinton, do when it comes to remarks made by blacks in not examining the context of the statement and jumping to the conclusion that this is another black calling for violence against whites.Your editorial also indicates that many black elected officials rallied to Mr. Clinton's support. However, note that Representative Charles Rangel of New York interpreted Mr. Clinton's action "as a way to court white voters." I am sure that the average black voter will agree.

1233	 2012	a	PhotoThe scenery is breathtaking and the tone resolutely jaunty, but “High Ground,” which treks alongside 11 wounded United States veterans (and one bereft mother) to the top of a Himalayan mountain, leaves an inescapably poignant trace.This has less to do with the wounds themselves — both visible and veiled — than with the astonishingly candid confessions of their bearers, hammered home all too often by careening combat footage. Whether displaying suck-it-up stoicism or hanging-by-a-thread fragility, these diverse men and women vividly convey the profound personal transformations their deployment has wrought. Scaling a 20,000-foot peak in Nepal might offer healing for some and for others an opportunity to test mobility and stamina; for everyone it’s an apt analogy for the challenge of readjusting to civilian life.Capturing this inaugural expedition of a program called Soldiers to Summits, the director, Michael Brown (a renowned mountaineer), digs below the adventure itself to reveal the gaping holes in our veteran care. Doing so, he translates a collage of experiences — some desperate, some hopeful, all tragic — into a first-person commentary on the malign reverberations of war.
605	 2015	a	Slide ShowTHURSDAY PUZZLE — I truly hope you’re not sick of hearing about the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, because we’re not done yet. Yes, the big boards have been put away, and I’m still working on another photo feature called “Humans of A.C.P.T.,” but in the meantime, above are some highlights from Puzzle 7.Today’s bonus question is this: When is a homage to a fellow constructor not merely a homage?Answer: When it’s a collaboration with the very constructor you were honoring.In 2008, a puzzle by Joe Krozel garnered a lot of attention because the black squares formed a word that seemed incendiary for a crossword puzzle. If you haven’t solved this one, give it a try. The concept behind the letters formed by the black squares and their connection to the clues made a Thursday puzzle — supposedly the “trickiest” one of the week, if not the most difficult — absolutely take flight.Today, Timothy Polin collaborates with Mr. Krozel on a similarly awesome idea that also carves a word into the grid. Not happy with merely one word, however, our constructors have chose to anagram the four letters S, H, U, and T and turn the conceit of “clue in the clues, entry in the grid” on its ear. While the bracketed [One arrangement of the letters in the grid] is what we’re given in the clue list, the clue to the anagrammed arrangement of letters is actually the answer. Not sure what I’m babbling about? Check this out:1 Across: CABANAS, which is what you get when the four letters spell “H-U-T-S” 21 Across: SEAL, which is what you get when the four letters spell “S-H-U-T” 8 Down: REAR, which is what you get when the four letters spell “T-U-S-H” 26 Down: ERGO, which is what you get when the four letters spell “T-H-U-S”And while there is the teensiest bit of junk in the grid, I think the fill here is mic-drop fabulous. Look at those long entries: STUPID PET TRICKS, ATOMIC REACTORS, REESE’S PIECES (you had me right there, Messrs. Polin and Krozel), SPINAL TAP, BLEEP OUT, NATIONAL PASTIME, ALL THOSE AGAINST (my personal favorite) and SEASONED TO TASTE.Our constructors have a lot to say about the construction of this very cool puzzle, so I’ll turn it over to them:Constructors’s Notes:Timothy Polin: When I thought up this idea about a year ago, I held out almost no hope that I’d be able to complete the puzzle on my own. Such a wide-open grid was pretty daunting, even without four theme answers that had to fit somewhere. I played around with it, and managed to fit three themers and fill everything left of the S, but I just couldn’t finish the East half. So I set the puzzle aside. In all likelihood it would have remained in draft limbo forever, too, had Joe not written me a very kind email last year after my comments on Xword Info had referenced a couple of his puzzles. I jumped at the chance to ask the creator of this puzzle’s inspiration for his take on my take of his grid letter concept. By some miracle he liked the idea, and it took us five or six weeks to go from empty grid to submission. The final grid ended up with about half of Joe’s fill and about half of mine. Joe did tremendous work refining the theme, insisting, among other things, that the theme entries be at least four letters long and spaced throughout the grid. Using SIC instead of ERGO, for example, would have made our task easier, but the longer entry felt more elegant and more exact. Joe Krozel: Tim approached me with this puzzle theme all worked out, and I was impressed that he had found a set of letters to accomplish the trick. So, the challenge that Tim invited me to undertake was to actually fill a grid which embodied his idea. My first little bit of meddling was to shorten the S and expand the H and the U … reducing the three-letter count from 24 to 17. We knew the East region would be difficult, so we generated a list of potential theme words that could be sprinkled around the grid. I suspected that a short theme entry could hide inside the ‘S,’ so it was only a matter of being persistent to get that region to fill. Once that section was locked down and PORTRAITS was in place, we concentrated on the West until achieving a fill we were happy with. We both had fun last August trying to figure out how to “solve” this puzzle’s construction, and we hope you enjoy your own solves as well.I would say that Mr. Polin and Mr. Krozel have given their puzzle that “extra push,” as Nigel Tufnel of SPINAL TAP would say:Your thoughts?In an earlier version of this post, the word “TUSH” was presented as an entry in the crossword puzzle. The word “REAR” is the entry, and the anagrammed, black square letters can spell out the word “TUSH.” Also, the word “ERGO” is the entry, while “THUS” is the anagrammed, black letter spelling. Stop laughing. This is my job.

3470	 1999	a	To the Editor:It is understandable that Jane Brody would be so negative about low-carbohydrate diets, since her books advocate a completely different approach to healthy eating. But low-carbohydrate diets really do work and eating (even complex) carbohydrates really can be fattening.I have lost 22 pounds and my cholesterol levels and blood pressure have dropped since March 1, 1999, when I started following the guidelines in ''Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution.'' When I reach my goal, weight, I will change to the maintenance diet, which allows more carbohydrates, but I will never ever allow myself to eat as many carbohydrates as Ms. Brody would recommend.MARIAN RUSSELLVienna

5027	 1990	a	The Interpublic Group of Companies and the Omnicom Group have both reported higher profits in the third quarter.Interpublic posted net income of $8.1 million, or 24 cents a share, a 16.3 percent increase from $6.9 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 11.6 percent, to $316 million, from $283.3 million in the 1989 quarter.Omnicom posted net income of $6.7 million, or 26 cents a share, a 19.3 percent gain from $5.6 million, or 22 cents, a year earlier. Revenues rose 14.2 percent, to $281.6 million, from $246.6 million in the 1989 quarter."For Omnicom, this is very significant because the domestic environment has been very sluggish," said Karen R. Ficker, an industry analyst with Lee Sager & Company, in New York. "They've bucked the trend when most people were predicting revenues to be flat or down." She noted that several of Omnicom's leading clients had increased or maintained their ad budgets.

4345	 1994	a	Among those results, according to prosecution blood experts, are findings that a bloody glove picked up at Mr. Simpson's house contains a "possible mixture" of his blood and the blood of both victims.Earlier, prosecutors had said that blood droplets found at the slaying scene contained many blood characteristics also found in samples of Mr. Simpson's blood.There is also testimony in the transcript that Mr. Simpson, who had a cut on his left hand when arrested, told investigators initially that he did not know how he got the cut, then later said he had apparently injured his hand while in Los Angeles on June 12 and then had re-injured it on the morning of June 13 when, after flying to Chicago overnight, he broke a glass when notified of Mrs. Simpson's death. Dismissed TestimonyThe transcript also includes testimony from a woman who said she saw Mr. Simpson speeding away from the crime scene on the night of June 12. Asked by prosecutors whether she had told her story to anyone else, the woman, Jill Shively, mentioned only her mother.But subsequently prosecutors discovered she been paid $5,000 to discuss her account on a syndicated television program.The general outlines of Ms. Shively's potentially crucial testimony and subsequent admission were known before release of the transcript. What the transcript provides is an insight into the anger and frustration her admission caused among prosecutors as they pushed for an indictment of Mr. Simpson a few days after the slayings.She was recalled before the 20 members of the grand jury, and one of the lead prosecutors, Marcia Clark, then told the panel:"I must ask you to completely disregard the statements given and the testimony given by Jill Shively in this case. I cannot allow her to be part of this case now that she has proven to be untruthful as to any aspect of her statement."

5515	 1987	a	The father of a white teen-ager charged with murder in the Howard Beach case testified yesterday that his son had told him two days after the incident, ''Daddy, I didn't do anything.''The father, Harold Kern, said that his son, Scott, 18 years old, also had told him, ''Daddy, I don't know what happened about anybody getting killed.''The father, a 46-year-old utility company employee, testified in State Supreme Court in Queens at the trial of his son and three other white teen-agers on murder or manslaughter charges stemming from what the prosecution says was a racial attack by a gang of young whites on three black men in Howard Beach, Queens, in December.One of the black men, Michael Griffith, 23, was struck and killed by a car when, the prosecution contends, he was chased onto the Belt Parkway by Mr. Kern and his co-defendants, Jon Lester and Michael Pirone, both 18, and Jason Ladone, 17.

2365	 2005	a	Unfortunately, if nary a false note is struck in the first quarter-hour of Ms. Gionfriddo's play, nary an honest one is heard in the remainder. Both the plotting and dialogue grow increasingly shrill and overstated. Even Justin's character, drawn with such satisfyingly dappled colors in the first scene, turns neon. He becomes a tiresome wiseacre dispensing sarcastic asides (often, admittedly, very funny ones) in rhythms that suggest he has a team of sitcom writers at work behind the scenes.Ms. Gionfriddo has set out to diagnose social ills, you see, and nuanced characters are not required. Her target is America's taste for blood and its tabloid-tinged, sex-crime-addicted popular media. She also has a few admonishing words for the benighted folks who exploit their own misfortunes in catering to said media's ravening need for new sensations.Justin is pressed into service as her moral megaphone. Seething at the way his mother's death has been packaged for popular consumption, he's the truth-teller who cuts through the cant and prurience all around him. "I am ready and willing to lead the return to shame movement," he tells Julie (Anna Paquin), the mixed-up college girl he meets at a bar one night. "People on TV are eating bugs, trying to marry millionaires. Shame is an idea whose time has come."Expounding on his own experience, he adds: "My mother was murdered. I don't know what the aftermath of that is supposed to be, but I don't think it's supposed to be a book and TV show and a rap song and a girl in my room. It's like we've lost the truth of it, we've buried it under all this junk."Unassailable arguments, these. There will be few in the audience, after all, ready to assert that the grisly death of Laci Peterson was cheated of its due share of air time. But this makes Ms. Gionfriddo's play less an inquiry into ambiguous areas of social thought and feeling than a seminar spelling out widely acknowledged truths.Some efforts are made to analyze root causes. Julie provides some intellectual verbiage suggesting the aesthetic value of sympathetic suffering, and Alden earnestly prattles on about the "empowerment" his television show provides for female victims. But it's Justin's ringing denunciations - "You're packaging sickness as entertainment" - that are meant to arouse our clucks of sympathy. Yet most in the audience will have done their clucking at these topics some time ago.Despite some fine work from Ms. Paquin and particularly Mr. Culkin, the director Terry Kinney's production is sabotaged by the conflicting impulses in the writing. Ms. Gionfriddo does not fully embrace the satiric potential in the material, but its cartoonish aspects subvert its power as a poignant drama about a young man's attempt to come to terms with his mother's death.

517	 2016	a	Though Mr. Trump’s campaign announced a new Asian Pacific American Advisory Committee last week, a Republican National Committee spokesman, Ninio Fetalvo, said Mr. Trump’s outreach to Asian-American voters had been coordinated until now mainly through two staff members at the party’s Washington headquarters. The party, he added, has also printed materials in a variety of Asian languages in cities like Las Vegas.Republicans’ difficulties with Asian-Americans are similar to those the party has faced with most minority groups. A sense that the party is hostile to immigrants and minorities has driven more Asian-American voters into the Democratic Party lately, political scientists and community leaders said. And if Republicans do not make more of an effort, those voting shifts could harden, just as Hispanics’ voting patterns have.“What we see now are some early indications that people who either leaned toward the Democratic Party or did not identify with either party are now starting to identify as Democrats,” said Karthick Ramakrishnan, a professor of political science at the University of California, Riverside. “This is still a group that is making up its mind,” he added, “but it should be concerning to the Republican Party that you’re starting to see this crystallization.”A national survey in the spring by Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote, a nonpartisan research group, showed “a significant leftward shift” since 2012 among Asian-American registered voters, with 47 percent now identifying with the Democratic Party, compared with 35 percent in 2012. Fifteen percent identified as Republican.In 1992, the year national exit polls started reporting Asian-American sentiment, the group leaned Republican, supporting George Bush over Bill Clinton 55 percent to 31 percent. But by 2012, that had reversed. Asian-Americans overwhelmingly supported President Obama over Mitt Romney — 73 percent to 26 percent, almost the same margin by which Hispanics favored Mr. Obama.A Pew Research Center report released last month showed that Asian-Americans have since 2008 embraced the Democratic Party at a faster rate than any other ethnic group.

1666	 2009	a	Mario Perez/ABCLast week, we found ourselves marveling at the work of Sterling Beaumon, the 13-year-old actor on “Lost” who plays the junior version of Benjamin Linus, the show’s resident genius of ambiguous morality (whose grown-up incarnation is played by Michael Emerson). A few days later, in a crazy twist of fate involving time travel, smoke monsters and a helpful publicist, we found ourselves on the phone with the young actor. In this conversation with Sterling (which may contain spoilers for the uninitiated), he spoke with us about the polarizing “Lost” cliffhanger he was involved in last week, and ended up quizzing us about what we think is taking place on the show.How were you cast to play Young Ben on “Lost”?I went through like three auditions, and the first one was with the casting director, April Webster. And I guess I did really good, because she said right in the room, “Oh, I’m going to want to bring you back to the producers and writers.” They took a week or so, and then they decided, yeah, we want you as this character, Young Ben. But this is way back in season 3. So then it evolved from season 3 to season 5.Were you a fan of “Lost” at the time?No, I actually wasn’t watching the show. I actually hated the show before I was on it. [laughs] Because I was on another show on ABC, called “In Case of Emergency,” and my episode that I guest-starred on kept on getting pre-empted, because of “Lost.”What did you think about the grown-up version of Ben?The only episode I had watched in season 3 was my episode, when it aired. So we waited on season 3 to come out on DVD before watched the rest. Then I thought he was a total jerk. But now, after season 4, I think he has a method to his madness.Which is…?I have no idea, but I think he’s a good guy in the end. He always has a plan, and it hasn’t turned out that badly, lately. And of course now that we know that the people on the freighter were not exactly the greatest people in the world, it just seems like maybe he really did save them.Are you asked to base your performance on Michael Emerson?My first episode of season 5, Jack Bender [a “Lost” director and executive producer] told me, “Don’t act like Ben. It will ruin what’s to come.” You have to have a little bit of him in there, because that’s totally impractical for him to change 150 percent. So I have a little bit of him in there, but he’s a nice, sweet, innocent kid. But he’s a very devious kid.How is he devious?Uh, he blew up a house.Good point. Was it at all difficult for you to film the very brutal cliffhanger that concluded last week’s episode?Oh, it was so much fun. I was so excited.Really?Yes. In fact, everybody had a controversy with a kid getting shot on TV. But I didn’t care, and neither did my mom. I found it funny.It was controversial on the set?No, they had to do it in the script. But everybody now, after the episode was aired, everybody online or everybody that I talk to is freaking out. They said, They can’t shoot a kid!But you were comfortable doing it?I’m fine with it. As long as it makes the show have better ratings, I’m cool.Was it hard for you to watch it later?Oh, I love watching that scene. It’s so much fun. Somebody has it up on YouTube, and I copied in and put it on my MySpace page.Are you at all like Ben in real life?Not too much. I mean, I have my secrets. [laughs]I suppose it would be silly to ask what those secrets are.Yeah. And most of them are about the show. I’m curious — do you think Ben is alive?Well, he grows up to become an adult, so he must be — right?Ah. You think he becomes an adult. Now, this is just from watching, if you listen back to when the Losties first meet up with the Dharma people, when Miles asked Daniel Faraday, “Hey, we don’t get involved, right?” And Daniel Faraday says, “It doesn’t matter now, we’re stuck in this time, we’re going to change something.” So they’re changing time. Don’t forget, way back in season 2, we saw Ben without his shirt on, and there was no scar.Are you becoming more recognizable at school for your television work?Not any more, because I don’t go to regular school any more. Because “Lost” was going to take up so much time, my school said you can’t miss that much, you’re going to have to go to a home-school program.Do you like that as much as going to a regular school?I’m liking it. It’s a lot harder, because you’re basically teaching yourself. That part’s hard about it.Is that how evil geniuses are created?I think it would be a good way.

2212	 2006	a	Norman Leonard, an eloquent courtroom voice for unpopular causes — West Coast longshoremen in the 1930's, left-wing dissenters in the 1950's, free-speech rebels and antiwar protesters in the 1960's and 70's — died on March 7 at a hospital in San Francisco. He was 92.His death was reported by the family.Mr. Leonard, who represented the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union for five decades, became nationally known with the government's efforts to deport the union's founding president, Harry Bridges, as an undesirable immigrant. Mr. Leonard defended him against perjury charges when Mr. Bridges, an immigrant from Australia, was accused of having falsely denied being a Communist at his naturalization hearing.Widely respected for his skills as a researcher, legal writer and appellate strategist, Mr. Leonard wrote the brief in the 1953 appeal of the Bridges case to the Supreme Court, which overturned the union leader's conviction. The court held that Mr. Bridges had been wrongly indicted after the statute of limitations on the charges ran out.During the same decade, Mr. Leonard helped defend West Coast leaders of the Communist Party against charges, under the Smith Act, of advocating the violent overthrow of the government. The Supreme Court reversed their convictions on First Amendment grounds.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyHe also represented clients called to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, defendants charged with harboring a fugitive, and one who was tried under the Taft-Hartley Act for serving as a union officer while being a member of the Communist Party.

4320	 1994	a	Smashing what they described as a smuggling ring that brought children to Brooklyn from Jamaica, detectives raided a Flatbush apartment yesterday and arrested five adults they accused of collecting thousands of dollars from anxious immigrant parents.Two children had arrived from Jamaica over the weekend -- a boy and a girl, each 9 years old, the police said. They were sharing bunk beds in the cramped two-bedroom apartment with six younger children who are relatives of the adults who were taken into custody. All eight appeared to be in good condition, the police said, but as a precaution they were taken to local hospitals for observation.An investigator on the case, Sgt. George Carrig, said the police found out about the ring from a Bronx woman who had hired the suspects to bring her 9-year-old son to this country. The boy had been living with his grandmother in Jamaica since his mother moved to this country in 1991.The woman, described by the police as an illegal immigrant, said that she had paid $1,100 in advance, but had received a call yesterday saying that she could pick up her son only if she paid another $2,000. She said she was told to hand over the money on a street corner a few blocks from the apartment. Phone Number Traced
471	 2016	a	STUART, Fla. — A rancid smell penetrated the front of Marisa and Duncan Baskin’s one-story house, which rests less than 100 feet from an inlet of the St. Lucie River in this tourist hamlet just inside the Atlantic coastline that bills itself as “America’s Happiest Seaside Town.”But the Baskins — whose 22-month-old daughter, like Ms. Baskin, suffers from asthma — and their neighbors are not so happy these days. In the water of the inlet of their subdivision in Northriver Shores, an inch-thick layer of bubbling ooze and slime emits a stench so overwhelming that none of the neighbors go outside.In fact, the Baskins were preparing Friday to stay with friends across town for the weekend just to get away from the green and blue algae bloom that has overtaken their small neighborhood marina, from which most neighbors have moved their boats.“Our lives revolve around the water; we have a boat, surfboards, and there’s nothing really to do here without the water,” Ms. Baskin, 31, a lifelong resident of Stuart who works as a social worker at a local hospital, said Friday. “And I think our governor and local politicians are to blame. This isn’t the first time this has happened, but it’s definitely the worst.”

1979	 2007	a	The sky was pitch black and a steady rain was falling when Eliot Spitzer, the new governor, arrived at the Spanish Revival lake house in Washington Park at 5:43 a.m. Monday to keep his first campaign promise: taking a morning run through the park on his first day in office.“I have one simple question: Whose idea was this?” Mr. Spitzer joked after he entered the lake house to cheers from friends, supporters and local residents. He marveled that old friends from college – “people who would never have been up this early” – had managed to roust themselves from bed in the wee hours of New Year’s Day.At a campaign rally in the lake house on Sept. 6, six days before the Democratic primary, Mr. Spitzer had promised to run through the park, which is west of the State Capitol, on his first day as governor. “It was one of those impromptu moments where you immediately say, ‘Why did I say that?’ ” Mr. Spitzer recalled.Washington Park was surveyed and planned by Frederick Law Olmsted, who designed Central Park. Mayor Gerald D. Jennings, who greeted Mr. Spitzer at the lake house, called the park “the jewel of the city.” A Democrat who took office in 1994, Mr. Jennings said the run showed that the new governor cared about the capital, which like many upstate cities is struggling to revive a sluggish local economy.Leading a pack of more than 100 runners – dozens of them wearing blue T-shirts with the slogan “Day One…Everything Is Changing” – Mr. Spitzer wound his way west along the lake; up a hill toward State Street, one of the city’s most elegant and historic thoroughfares; past the Soldiers and Sailors Monument; and along a bridle path back to the lake house.The route was just short of 2 miles. The run started at 5:50 a.m. and ended 13 minutes later, at 6:03 a.m.Sweaty and somewhat out of breath, Mr. Spitzer said afterwards, “I appreciate all of your support, loyalty, arguably bad judgment, getting out here this time of day, but hey, that’s what makes us New Yorkers.” He joked this daughter Elyssa, who is a cross-country runner and joined him for the jog, “leaves me in the dust.”Mr. Spitzer, who ran in the New York City marathon in 1983, finishing just under 4 hours, said he tries to work out 5 times a week, often using exercise machines, even though he lives close to Central Park and still runs there.Mr. Spitzer, who was sworn in at midnight, said he got to bed at 1:30 a.m. and woke up when “the internal clock started kicking in about 4:30, because I thought I’d be late” for the run.The new governor spoke admiringly of the Executive Mansion, where he took the oath of office, noting that on one wall was an original copy of the Constitution from 1787 and, below it, notes from the Poughkeepsie Convention, where New York decided to ratify the constitution, with the signatures of Alexander Hamilton and John Jay.Mr. Spitzer said his predecessor, George E. Pataki, had left behind a lengthy note, following a tradition for governors to give parting advice to their successors.The public inauguration ceremony was moved ahead from noon to 1 p.m. in the hope that the dismal weather would lift, but Mr. Spitzer said he did not mind the precipitation. “Rain is cleansing,” he said. “We’re washing away the dirty and the grime. We’re going to start fresh. It’s going to be great. It’s starting to clear up. I can feel it.”Then he got in his black Chevrolet Suburban and took off at 6:10 a.m. It was not clear whether he intended to go back to sleep.
1176	 2012	a	Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.Touring the United States for the London Times, the war correspondent William Howard Russell reached New Orleans late in May 1861 to find a city ablaze. Confederate flags flew from the public buildings and private homes. Soldiers paraded through the streets in smart columns of dash and pomp. Gentlemen at the St. Charles Hotel pored over the latest papers for news of the dawning war. The police were rounding up suspected abolitionists, and every night mysterious fires flared up around the city – set, it was rumored, by the slaves.After hobnobbing with politicians, planters and merchants, Russell observed that the Confederate elite “believe themselves, in fact, to be masters of the destiny of the world.” But they soon discovered they were not even masters of their own homes.New Orleans was a slave city: its fortunes depended on the slave-based sugar and cotton plantations of the lower Mississippi Valley, and the buying and selling of people was a big local business. More than 13,000 enslaved people (1 out of every 12 residents) lived in the city itself in 1860, working as stevedores, carpenters, valets, cooks and laundresses. Some were hired out and earned wages for their owners. Women made up a majority of adult slaves, performing “domestic” labor for masters and mistresses who could be just as abusive as any whip-wielding plantation overseer.Library of CongressYet daily routines took household slaves out to the city streets and shops, gave them the chance to socialize with friends and family and find refuge in hideaways outside their masters’ gaze. Their skills as laborers, and their networks of kinship and community, would aid them when the Union Army arrived in May 1862, barely a year after the war began.The Union “occupation” of New Orleans was also a liberation, if that is the appropriate word to describe the gnarled process of emancipation that took place there. Freedom did not arrive on board David Farragut’s warships; the Union had not yet committed to a policy of emancipation. Nor did it arrive with the Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1863, which exempted the city and other territory once part of the Confederacy but no longer “in rebellion.” And yet slavery began to crumble in New Orleans from the moment Union troops arrived. The letters and diaries of Confederates in New Orleans in the weeks and months after the Federals arrived were already filling with despair and rage at the loss of authority over their slaves. What was going on?We tend to look back at emancipation as a series of official acts. But in many places, including New Orleans, it was the result of local initiative as much as Union policy. In occupied New Orleans, slaves quickly recognized that the balance of power had shifted away from their owners, and they took advantage.Many slaves, for example, ran away to the Union Army. Hundreds fled to Camp Parapet, a fortification just above the city, where the abolitionist commanding officer, Brig. Gen. John W. Phelps, welcomed them. Even those who were thought to be most loyal to their owners ran off. “There are many instances in which house-servants, those who have been raised by people, have deserted them,” complained Clara Solomon, a teenager in the city.Slaveowners felt robbed by the Federals and betrayed by their slaves. Owners claiming to be loyal to the Union petitioned for the return of their human property, sparking a controversy on “the negro question” between Phelps and Gen. Benjamin Butler, commander of the Department of the Gulf. The hard-nosed Butler was famous for his ingenious policy of confiscating slaves as “contrabands of war” in Virginia, but he did not want to wreck Louisiana’s sugar plantations or alienate white Unionists. He thought that Phelps had crossed the line by fomenting slave unrest. “We shall have a negro insurrection here I fancy,” Butler confided to his wife.Butler and Phelps clashed, too, over Phelps’s arming of black soldiers at Camp Parapet. Phelps resigned, but Butler eventually came around to the wisdom of the policy. By the end of 1862, black men – both free and slave – were joining the Union Army in southern Louisiana in droves. When asked whether slaves would fight their masters, one man told a Union officer, “Just put the gun into our hands, and you’ll soon see that we not only know how to shoot, but who to shoot.” The recruitment of black soldiers ate away at slavery, especially in Louisiana, which was credited with supplying over 24,000 black men to the Union Army, more than any other state.Less well known are the contributions of enslaved women to the hastening of emancipation. Barred from battle, enslaved women fought daily skirmishes with masters and mistresses in their own kitchens and courtyards. They talked back. They refused to be beaten. They ran away, and returned with bayonets. “Our servants do pretty much as they please,” protested Ann Wilkinson Penrose, whose son was off fighting in the Confederate Army. Penrose’s torrential diary chronicles her family’s loosening grip on their slaves after the arrival of the Union Army and offers a striking example of what the historian Thavolia Glymph calls “the war within” slaveholding households.Related Disunion Highlights Explore multimedia from the series and navigate through past posts, as well as photos and articles from the Times archive. See the Highlights »Simmering resentments boiled over on April 14, 1863. Penrose was angry at Becky, her cook, for baking bad bread and cakes. She went into the kitchen, slapped Becky, and “asked her how she dared to send in such bread & cakes.” Becky took offense. “She started up, looked furiously at me, and exclaimed, ‘don’t you do that again, let it be the last time, or I’ll just march out of this yard’” Becky was told to hush or else a policeman would be called in. As Penrose recounts, Becky retorted that “she might send for whom she pleased she didn’t care.”Penrose didn’t send for a policeman; her family decided it wouldn’t have done any good. The police were now on the slaves’ side, they believed. Becky’s defiance – and Penrose’s inability to punish her for it – signaled the demise of slavery in New Orleans. The institution crumbled in New Orleans not from a single dramatic blow or stroke of a pen, but from the slow accumulation of resistance by slaves like Becky.The law eventually caught up with the facts on the ground. Early in 1864, Union Gen. Nathaniel Banks (who had replaced Butler as commander of the Department of the Gulf) recognized that Louisiana’s state constitutional provisions and laws concerning slavery were “inconsistent with the present condition of public affairs” and declared them “inoperable and void.”Finally, in September 1864, more than two years after the arrival of Union troops, Louisiana’s all-white electorate ratified a new State Constitution that formally abolished slavery in the state. Heartened by the summer’s debates over emancipation, one black soldier predicted that “under God, this will yet be a pleasant land for the colored man to dwell in.”Follow Disunion at twitter.com/NYTcivilwar or join us on Facebook.Sources: Sources: William Howard Russell, “My Diary North and South,” Eugene Berwanger, ed.: John Blassingame, “Black New Orleans, 1860-1880”; Walter Johnson, “Soul By Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market”; Ira Berlin, Barbara J.

2110	 2007	a	Alan Weisman’s book “The World Without Us” is a 324-page thought experiment: What would happen to the Earth if humans ceased to exist? The work, published in June, is not a science-fiction novel, but rather a thoroughly researched, scientifically grounded account of how the environment — natural and built — would change if people were no longer around.One chapter in the book, “The City Without Us,” is particularly relevant — if depressing — for New Yorkers. It portrays a city robbed of its eight million people, submerged by water from below, then ravaged by devastating fires, and finally overgrown with vegetation. The Web site for the book has a fascinating slide show depicting New York City’s fate, from two days to 15,000 years after the disappearance of humans.In a phone interview with Mr. Weisman, a journalist who has written extensively about science, he told us why he chose Manhattan as his case study of a city without humans:Manhattan Island kind of epitomizes urbanity. The thought of all this concrete and steel reverting to forest is unthinkable, and yet it turns out there was a forest there before. My question when I went to New York – and it’s a question I posed to civil engineers, architects, climatologists, botanists and biologists — was: Could the city ever revert to a forest again? And the unanimous conclusion was: Absolutely. Not only would it, but it will.The book’s chapter on New York begins with Eric W. Sanderson, a landscape ecologist who directs the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Mannahatta Project, an attempt to recreate, through computer simulations, what Manhattan Island looked like when Henry Hudson first saw it in 1609. (Bottom line, the island was much more watery then.)What follows in the chapter is an explanation of how that landscape, fairly untouched until the arrival of Europeans, would quickly reestablish itself if humans were gone. For starters, subway tunnels — which are kept dry because of a system of pumps that remove 13 million gallons of water each day — would flood. (This already happens when heavy rains drench the city, as occurred on Aug. 8.) Without the pumps, water would fill the subway system in a couple of days; clogged sewers would overflow, flooding the street surface. “Within 20 years, the water-soaked steel columns that support the street above the East Side’s 4, 5, and 6 trains corrode and buckle,” Mr. Weisman writes. “As Lexington Avenue caves in, it becomes a river.”Even now, the freeze-thaw cycle creates cracks in the city sidewalk that weeds quickly fill. Without maintenance workers to pull up those weeks, the roots of the powerful and hardy ailanthus tree would heave up sidewalks and wreak havoc on sewers.“Starting with the mulch collecting in gutters, a layer of soil will start forming atop New York’s sterile hard shell, and seedlings will sprout,” Mr. Weisman writes.Skeptical? Look no farther than the High Line, the abandoned segment of elevated railroad track in Manhattan. Trains stopped running there in 1980, and ailanthus trees quickly emerged — joined by onion grass, lamb’s ear, goldenrod, crocuses, irises, evening primrose, asters and Queen Anne’s lace. This “untended, flowering green ribbon,” Mr. Weisman notes, is now scheduled to become a park.Without heating and air-conditioning, Manhattan’s skyscrapers would expand and contract with the cold and hot weather. Joints between walls and roof lines would separate, rain would enter, bots would rust, facades would pop off and insulation would be exposed. Dry lightning would ignite dead branches and leaves. Gas lines would catch fire.Within 200 years of humans’ disappearance, Mr. Weisman writes, “colonizing trees will have substantially replaced pioneer weeds.”Buildings would collapse, their crushed concrete raising the pH levels of the soil beneath, good news for trees that need less acidic environments. With stronger and more frequent hurricanes buffering the Atlantic coast, unsteady structures would be toppled by the wind. Without constant painting and maintenance, bridges would corrode and buckle.“Gradually, the asphalt jungle will give way to a real one,” Mr. Weisman writes.(Curious detail: Contrary to the conventional wisdom, he writes, without our heated buildings and garbage, the cockroaches and rats would quickly freeze and starve to death.)Some of the most intriguing observations in the chapter concern the durability and permanence of modern glass and steel buildings. Such buildings would not survive long without constant human maintenance, according to Mr. Weisman. In contrast, older stone buildings like Grand Central Terminal and St. Paul’s Chapel (“built in 1766 from Manhattan’s own hard schist”) would be among New York’s most enduring monuments. So would bank vaults, which are built for strength.Mr. Weisman said he did not expect, when he set out on his research, to discover that the soaring edifices of Manhattan are in fact quite fragile. “It was a surprise to me, when I started talking to people, to find out that cities can and will collapse, particularly cities that are not made out of big, immense chunks of stone,” he said in the interview. “Our construction just isn’t that durable.”If you think that climate change is the greatest environmental threat to humanity, you might find this observation from the book sobering: “Three times in the past 100,000 years, glaciers have scraped New York clean. Unless humankind’s Faustian affair with carbon fuels ends up tipping the atmosphere past the point of no return, and runaway global warming transfigures Earth into Venus, at some unknown date glaciers will do so again.”“The World Without Us” paints a fairly grim portrait. (Reviewing the work in The Times, Janet Maslin called it “punishingly bleak,” while Jennifer Schuessler, writing in The Times Book Review, described it as “morbidly fascinating.”)A core trait of “The World Without Us” is that it is neither preachy nor sentimental. The closest Mr. Weisman comes to a policy prescription is toward the end of the book, where he discusses, but does not endorse, the idea that human population growth should be curbed to save the planet — a point of view espoused, in its most radical form, by the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement.Mr. Weisman said he did not agree with the aims of the movement (whose motto is “Live long and die out”). “We are a species that does deserve to be here,” he said in the interview. “The whole idea of the human race being some cancer or acne on the planet — I don’t buy that.” If anything, he said, the book affirms the necessity of people he interviewed, like hydraulics workers and bridge engineers, whose daily work literally keeps New York City standing.Mr. Weisman has done several public readings. Surprisingly, he said, many readers have said they found the book “oddly comforting and hopeful,” in that it argues that humans’ (often destructive) influence on the environment can be reversed, with enough time, and that life is resilient.“Even if it has to be without us, many people — frankly, me included — find a measure of peace in the notion that life will go on,” Mr. Weisman said.And some readers, he added, have even found a dark humor in the apocalyptic portrayal.Said Mr. Weisman: “You’d be surprised at the number of New Yorkers who’ve said, ‘God, I love it when you let nature trash Manhattan.'”

4818	 1991	a	For many gardeners, late July and early August are the time for nursery hunting. Heat, and prolonged drought in much of the Northeast, bring a lull in the garden. Fall looms ahead, with the cool nights and soft rains that make it the best time to plant new perennials. Plants will have a few months to establish vigorous root systems to get them through winter, ready to flourish next spring.Nursery hunting, a rewarding sport, is a game that falls into three rough categories. There are the purely local nurseries, often very good. Treasures are more likely to be found in those nurseries with national reputations, which put out lists or catalogues but do not sell by mail order. Excellent examples of such nurseries are Hillside in Norfolk, Conn., Weston in Hopkinton, Mass., and Wells-Medina outside Seattle.I have special affection, however, for those nurseries that deal mainly in mail orders but are open to the public, maintain display gardens and sell plants in containers. And I am naturally most interested in those from which I have ordered perennials.Heronswood Nursery in Kingston, Wash., the Andre Viette Farm and Nursery in Fishersville, Va., and White Flower Farm in Litchfield, Conn., are a few of the many I have visited at this time of year. The visits always lift my spirits and renew my enthusiasm for gardening in this, the most disheartening period of the horticultural year. My car always looks like a greenhouse when I get home.
302	 2017	a	“Even if you have experience selling on the street, the airport is a whole new world because of the hours of operation,” Mr. Montoya said. “You have to be open 365 days a year. You don’t get your weekends.”There are also staffing and logistical challenges.“First it was just me,” he said. “Then I hired a couple people to help, because I had to go buy the inventory and do the payroll.”Mr. Montoya continued, “But what you have to understand is, the airport is pretty far away from the city, so not that many people want to go out there to work. Then you have to be sure you hire people that can clear security, so background checks become really important. Then once you get them their badge, just getting from the parking lot to your stand can be literally 30 minutes. So you have to have people who can deal with that.”Francine LeFrak ran into an especially onerous security issue when she set up a kiosk selling handmade jewelry at Newark Liberty International Airport in December. The two employees she hired for the venture — clients of Same Sky, a nonprofit she founded that teaches formerly incarcerated women in Jersey City to become entrepreneurs through jewelry-making — had criminal records.“One of them was actually wearing an ankle bracelet from the county jail,” Ms. LeFrak said.The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has a partnership with a management company to bring small businesses into the airport’s Terminal B. When she brought them her business idea, “I never thought they’d say ‘yes’ to me in the first place,” Ms. LeFrak said.“Then, once we got in, at every turn there was a headwind,” she said. Mostly, the problem was weather. (The kind that doesn’t cause flight delays.)

5906	 1983	a	Agreement was reached last night for six cable television companies to bring service to Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island. The Board of Estimate voted unanimously last night to approve the franchises, and no significant changes were made from the terms that were reached a week ago.''Substantively,'' said Morris Tarshis, the city director of franchises, ''it's the same.'' He said the contracts should be signed the week of July 18 and the first wires should be laid this fall in a process that, the agreement says, should see the boroughs outside Manhattan completely wired within seven years. Pleas on Minority HiringExecutives of the companies said last night they would heed pleas that members of racial minority groups be equitably represented in hiring.''We want a fair share,'' said Robert Munoz of the Citywide Coalition of Community Construction Workers. Officials of the companies - American Cablevision, Cablevision Systems, Cox Cable, Queens Inner Unity Cable, Vision Cable and Warner Amex -promised they would meet those pleas.

393	 2016	a	Lady of the Valley: Jane Ormsby Gore’s HomeThe English decorator has lived a life so wild and full that it almost reads as fiction. This chapter takes place in the Welsh countryside, in the poetic home she’s made for herself there.
118	 2019	a	Or rather, it existed the way most houses on sitcoms do, in your mind’s eye. It was a collection of separate sets on a soundstage, edited with exterior footage to synthesize the illusion of a warm, groovy midcentury home. Mike Brady may have been an architect, but TV supplied the home’s modular parts, and your brain completed the assembly.So like Disney Imagineers or Las Vegas casino designers, HGTV set out to build something realer than real. They would rip up the house’s actual, disappointingly conventional interior, enlarge it (by 2000 square feet, they say) and make a physical manifestation of something that never existed.“A Very Brady Renovation” feels like the logical progression of, and the perfect metaphor for, the reboot and revival craze that has brought us “Fuller House” and “Twin Peaks: The Return,” that exhumed “Veronica Mars” and “Murphy Brown.” The vast mechanism of TV and streaming has become a “Star Trek” replicator of pop culture. If I want to see Jean-Luc Picard on my TV again: Make it so!“The Brady Bunch” is the perfect show to reboot this way, because it has made a posthumous art of reproducing itself. Long before “Friends” liberated $100 million from Netflix’s pockets, it was the Patient Zero of TV nostalgia, extending its five-season life through reruns, spinoffs, TV movies, theatrical movies, cartoons, a variety show, memes (“Sure, Jan”) and not a few tell-alls and documentaries. Its memory surpassed its actual existence.And memory is what HGTV is selling here — well, memory and its own brand. “A Very Brady Renovation” casts the hosts of no less than five of the network’s shows: “Good Bones,” “Restored by the Fords,” “Flea Market Flip,” “Hidden Potential” and, of course, “Property Brothers,” whose charismatic and ubiquitous Jonathan and Drew Scott anchor the 90-minute first episode.

3595	 1998	a	Adam Mann was 5 years old and weighed only 35 pounds when he finally died on March 5, 1990. He had been abused for some time. When he was wheeled into the emergency room of Our Lady of Mercy Hospital in the Bronx his body was covered with thick welts, severe lacerations and deep ugly bruises. His head and lips were battered and swollen, as if he'd been in a prizefight.Over time, in an insane sequence of beatings at the hands of his father, Rufus Chisholm, and his mother, Michelle Mann, Adam had suffered broken bones, liver damage and had his teeth knocked out. At one point, in the attack that eventually killed him, he was hung from a coat hook and beaten.Adam had four siblings who, at the time of his death, ranged in age from 8 months to 9 years. All but the youngest child (the only girl) were grotesquely abused. Adam's brothers were regularly whipped, burned and beaten. The litany of their injuries included a broken leg, broken wrist and fractured skull.Although aware of potentially disastrous problems with the family, child welfare officials did not intervene in a meaningful way until Adam was killed. The surviving youngsters were placed in foster care. Rufus Chisholm pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter and is in prison. Michelle Mann served time for assault and was released from prison in 1994.
4958	 1990	a	'An Excuse for Failure'Mr. Gill, whose commission was created by former Mayor Edward I. Koch and the Board of Education in the wake of a series of disclosures about school corruption, attacked the central board, its bureaucracy and its leadership for what he said was a desire to use the decentralization of the system 20 years ago into 32 local districts ''as an excuse for failure.''''They seem to have believed that they could just let those districts stew in their own juices, just send them a memo or directive once in a blue moon and then let them sink or swim on their own,'' Mr. Gill said.But even more startling was the attack on Mr. Wagner. The son of a former New York City Mayor, the grandson of a former United States Senator and a confidant of Mr. Koch, Mr. Wagner has been been one of the city's most prominent political fixtures for two decades and played a key role in appointing both the commission and Mr. Gill. By picturing himself as a reformer intent on overhauling a shabby school system, he has generally been able to elude the criticism that regularly befalls that system. His term as board president, a part-time position for which he is paid $20,000 a year, expires at the end of this month. In an interview yesterday, Mr. Wagner, board president since January 1986, dismissed much of the criticism as unfair, saying Mr. Gill was attacking failings that he and the other board members can do little about. He spoke of his battle for legislation that would abolish the Board of Examiners, the agency that tests and licenses teachers, and give the chancellor a greater role in choosing district superintendents.Mr. Gill said Mr. Wagner was ''very dedicated'' and his ''heart was in the right place.'' But, he said, he and the rest of the board were ''lumbering'' along and had not even responded promptly to repeated findings by his commission of corruption and inefficiency within the school system.Criticism on SofarelliMr. Wagner, he said, did not dismiss his Inspector General, Michael Sofarelli, even though the commission revealed significant inadequacies in how the office conducted its investigations of wrongdoing by employees. ''Why would you want to continue a guy who has run the office in the way he had run it,'' Mr. Gill said in an interview. Mr. Wagner, he said, also did not ''exert his influence'' to obtain the removal of the chief investigator for the Board of Examiners after the commission exposed serious flaws in the screening process for new teachers. That process, Mr. Gill said, permitted a teacher convicted of sexual abuse to get appointed to a Bronx junior high school.

3895	 1997	a	Mr. Hatch has scheduled a committee vote on Mr. Lee for Thursday, and Congressional officials say it is uncertain whether Mr. Lee can muster the 10 votes needed to send the nomination to the Senate floor. He presumably has support from the eight Democrats on the committee and maybe from one Repubican, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.Republican Senators and other conservatives, who say the Administration's civil rights policies are too liberal, oppose Mr. Lee because of his unwillingness to disassociate himself from positions he took as the Western Regional Director of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, a liberal civil rights group, on affirmative action and school busing.''We think that we have a decent chance of beating this nomination,'' said Clint Bolick, vice president for litigation of the Institute for Justice, a conservative group that opposes Mr. Lee. ''This is the one opportunity that the Senate has to express its outrage over the Clinton Administration's civil rights policies. Lee exemplifies an activist, pro-racial-preferences agenda. So this seems the right opportunity.''The machinations around Mr. Lee are not unusual for a nominee to the top civil rights post, which has been a lightning rod for debate on some of the most contentious social issues the country faces, including busing, affirmative action and gay rights. Mr. Lee is the first person nominated to the post since the Republicans took over the Senate in 1994.The choice of Mr. Lee is shaping up as a battle between the increasingly conservative Senate and the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, an organization that has supplied the last four Democratic nominees for Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights: Drew Days, Lani Guinier, Deval Patrick and, now, Mr. Lee.In written questions, Republicans on the Judiciary Committee have sought to learn whether Mr. Lee would change his ways in his new job.''There are several Republicans who are concerned,'' a Republican staff member said. ''While he did say he would just enforce the law if confirmed, given his answers and testimony and his failure to distinguish the positions he would take as head of Civil Rights Division from those he took at the NAACP, I think Republican senators have cause to question what his positions would be.''

45	 2019	a	Still, wherever Lopez goes, he is never far from a disquisition on humanity’s merciless ways. Rising from his bed one night in the tropical heat of Isla Santa Cruz, in the Galápagos, he walks alone (a frequent habit that makes for some of the book’s best bits) to the beach and watches a group of brown pelicans asleep on the bay. The birds’ vulnerability — “oblivious just now to all that is hidden and potentially threatening in the lightless world we share” — leads his train of thought to Spanish conquistadores releasing vicious dogs on Indians, and from there to the European bankers who underwrote the slave trade in West Africa, and on to the present horrors of Boko Haram. It’s all, ultimately, in the service of pondering the roots of barbarism, and how we ignore the barbarism unfolding in our own society at our peril.Image Clearcutting near Highway 30 in Oregon. Credit... Leah Nash for The New York Times[ Read our round-up of recent books about climate change. ]Strangely, though, these relentless reminders of egregious acts don’t diminish the appeal of seeing the world through Lopez’s eyes. His reverence for exploring every corner of the world, even the sites of its most shameful histories, is infectious. Rarely does Lopez decline an offer of adventure, no matter how potentially grueling the trip might be. Traveling, he writes, “turns the mind toward a consideration of context and releases it from the dictatorship of absolute truths about humanity. It helps one understand that all people do not want to be on the same road.”Lopez’s journeys often start in ways that make you shake your head. (More than a few trips begin with a banal sentence like: “In the austral fall of 1987 I was traveling through Namibia with a few people.” You know, as one does.) One night he reads a paper in the scientific journal Nature about the discovery of some 4.27-billion-year-old zircon crystals in remote Western Australia. He immediately emails the researchers about visiting the field site — because he just happens to be headed to Perth soon, “en route from Zimbabwe to the Northern Territory.”The scientists initially ignore his request. But he persists, and several years later he’s finally on his way to the Jack Hills. He flies from the United States to Sydney, and then goes by train to Perth, persuading the engineers to let him ride in the locomotive. One day, crossing the vast Nullarbor Plain, “the train suddenly ran into a wall of water,” a drenching rainstorm. When the weather clears, a double rainbow appears. And then a mob of kangaroos arrives, over a hundred of them, leaping across the plain. “The sight of it was so exhilarating the three of us in the cab nodded an affirmation to one another. Whatever was wild and lyrical in the timeless world, we were in the middle of it now.”Lopez proceeds in a rented four-wheel drive to a sheep-ranching outpost where a geologist has arranged lodging, 120 miles from the nearest town “on an unsigned dirt track.” When he arrives, the rancher and his daughter have “a meat pie in the oven, and he wanted to know whether I took milk with my tea.” One day, as Lopez is heading out to the geology site, the rancher offers him a rifle and asks if he’d mind shooting any wild goats he encounters. Lopez declines. But through evening chats on the veranda, the two men form a bond; the rancher ultimately visits Lopez at home in Oregon. This knack for making friends in the most unlikely places resonates long after you turn the last page. “Are we not bound,” he asks, “to learn how to speak with each other?”Had we mastered that skill 30-odd years ago, would we be where we find ourselves today, grappling with violent xenophobia while forests incinerate, oceans rise and acidify, magnificent organisms everywhere fade away? Where will we be three decades on, if we don’t take heed? There is still time, though not as much as there once was, to shape what’s coming.
7536	 1964	a	MERIDIAN, Miss., Nov. 30—Civil rights workers, harassed and unwanted in this eastern Mississippi city, befriended a lonely sailor from New York, and as a result the small band of visitors is now involved in an incident that could wreck the movement here.Eight white young men and women, almost the entire staff of the Council of Federated Organizations project here, were rounded up last week when the police found in the council's office a portable record player that they said had been stolen by the sailor from, a local apartment.The sailor, Vincent Cummuskey, 18 years old, of 115-10: 221st Street, St. Albans, Queens, is in jail charged with burglary. Held with him are two civil rights workers, Sandra Watts, 22, a school teacher from Lakeview, Ore., and Joseph M.Morse of Dakota, Minn. Six other council staff members have been freed.Mr. Morse, who according to his friends is studying for the priesthood, was charged with receiving stolen property. Miss Watts was charged with being an accessory after the fact of burglary. The police said she was with Mr. Cummuskey when he committed a theft.

6236	 1973	a	Later, his present lawyer, Donald Tucker, gave him $5, and the former gypsy ‐ cab driver walked through the rain alone and took the subway home to his mother's apartment at 401 West 40th Street.At his mother's apartment Mr. Garcia received the congratulations of relatives and friends late yesterday afternoon. Before that he had been busy seeing his lawyers.I've been straightening out my life,” he said. “My wife and I have been having trouble since 1966, and we have been separated for the last six years. I saw my wife and made arrangements for the support of my son, Jonathan David, who is 6 years old.“She will let me visit him regularly, and my chief concern now is bringing him up right. We are going to be divorced—she is giving her consent.“My lawyers are looking for a job for me and I am also going to welfare to see if they can help, me get a job. I have to have a job to support my son.”As news of Mr. Garcia's acquittal cittulated yesterday through the Criminal Courts Building at 100 Centre Street, where the case has long been a matter of considerable discussion, Mr. vanden Heuvel spoke out again on the subject.“I've been pleading for months for this trial to take place,” he said.It's an injustice, he said, “to keep anyone in detention for more than 90 days without a trial.”

To find broadcast options where you are, click here.Live coverage and analysis of the final here.Why Liverpool will winJürgen Klopp does not feel cursed. He does not, as he made plain during his Friday evening news media call in Madrid, even feel unlucky. He might have lost every final he has reached with Liverpool, and six of the seven he has contested over all, but he does not see that as a harbinger.The reason for that, put simply, is that this is the possibly the first time — and certainly the first time with Liverpool — that he has gone into a final in charge of the favorite. The bald fact of the Premier League table illustrates that Liverpool has been significantly more consistent than Tottenham this season: Klopp’s team eventually finished 26 points ahead of Spurs.Throw in that Liverpool had England’s best defense and two of its three top scorers, and then add that it went through the pomp, circumstance and attendant emotional sweep of a Champions League final 12 months ago, and Liverpool’s quiet, unassuming confidence is understandable.

2120	 2007	a	Workers are rolling out the grass, installing light fixtures and testing the water valves on the long-awaited $5 million African Burial Ground Memorial, at Duane and Elk Streets in Lower Manhattan, just a few blocks north of City Hall.The completion of the memorial, which will formally open to the public in a Friday ceremony, is the culmination of a nearly 16-year process that started when human remains were discovered during a 1991 excavation for the expansion of a federal building at 290 Broadway.“It’s been a struggle,” said Rodney Leon, 38, the designer of the memorial, who first submitted his proposal in 1997. “But nothing compared to that of the people that are buried here.” The opening ceremony will start at the Statue of Liberty, and then continue to Bowling Green, where the public will be invited to march up toward the memorial.The 15,000 square-foot plot where the memorial is situated is but a small remnant of an expansive burial ground that served as the final resting place for enslaved and free Africans from the 1690s to the 1790s. As many 15,000 are buried in what is considered the largest colonial-era cemetery for blacks in the United States. The remains of 419 men, women and children that were excavated were reinterred in 2003 in seven carved wooden crypts. All the bodies were discovered with their heads to the west and their feet to the east, so the memorial itself is oriented along an east-west axis, off the Manhattan grid.Located in the shadow of a host of federal buildings, the site is sandwiched between three barricades protected by security guards. “It’s certain the most secure site in all of New York,” said Howard Dodson, the director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, who played a key role in getting the memorial to this point.The African Burial Ground was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993. Last year, President Bush signed a law that made the site a national monument, to be maintained in perpetuity by the National Park Service.The granite memorial has seven design elements – including a map of the world centered on Africa, a triangular structure meant to emulate the ship passage from Africa to the New World, and a spiral wall of 20 religious symbols from the African diaspora including images from Egypt, Haiti, Cuban, and Brazil. The granite used in the monument comes from Southern Africa and Canada. “It’s about the Old and New World stone coming together,” said Mr. Leon.The spiral wall leads down to a map of the world centered on the coast of West Africa, with rays spiraling outwards to the United States, Brazil, Europe and the Caribbean islands.One neat architectural trick: If you stand at the very center of the circular map, on the coast of West Africa, the acoustics of the memorial are such that your voice echoes back with a deep vibrato.

5412	 1987	a	This danger is intensified by the overhang of billions of dollars of debt owed by third world countries to Western banks, and the fear that there is no ''lender of last resort'' capable of rescuing the debtors from default, if their ability to export and service their debts were to be wrecked by a steep slump in the industrial world.Nevertheless, the world economy and financial system has been kept afloat by the willingness of the United States to play the role of what George Soros, president of the Quantum Fund, calls the ''borrower of last resort.'' By running both a huge budget and trade deficit, the United States has provided a haven for both foreign goods and foreign capital. This has been sustained by what Mr. Soros, in a forthcoming book called ''The Alchemy of Finance,'' refers to as President Reagan's ''Imperial Circle,'' with the budget deficit, tax cuts and rising military expenditures driving the economy, and an overvalued dollar, high interest rates and the trade deficit sucking in the foreign capital needed to finance American public and private debts, which now exceed $9 trillion.The question is how long this can go on and whether recent events foreshadow its approaching end. Mr. Soros draws up two scenarios. The first, relatively optimistic, is that the dollar declines gradually, bringing relief to American exports and import-competitive industries. Inflation picks up a little, but the economy recovers, and the lower dollar makes a safe landing. The prospects of this happening, Mr. Soros says, are better than at any time since the inception of Mr. Reagan's Imperial Circle because the authorities in the major industrial countries have recognized the need to bring the imbalances under control. It is conceivable, he finds, that currencies may settle down into a more stable rate pattern as the world monetary system passes from free floating or dirty floating to managed floating.The alternative is what Mr. Soros calls a ''disaster scenario.''The tradeable goods sector remains under pressure in the United States and elsewhere. The weakness spreads to other sectors. The Federal Reserve, to prevent recession and a blow to the banking system, pumps out money, but much of the stimulation leaks out in the form of imports. Eventually, foreigners are loath to hold dollars, long-term interest rates climb, the dollar falls precipitously and inflation worsens, even as the economy slides into a full-fledged recession. * * *Which scenario is more likely? The shocks of the past few days suggest that the disaster scenario is all too credible. But the response of governments in avoiding a showdown on protectionism and in providing cushions for the falling dollar suggest that the more hopeful scenario is still possible.

4745	 1991	a	While China was a partner of Western countries in the early stages of the Persian Gulf crisis, it has stepped back from the coalition since the fighting began and some diplomats worry that the split with the West could deepen.The fissure is not expected to widen to the point that Beijing would use its seat on the Security Council to cause major difficulties for the coalition. But even mild Chinese criticism of the allied forces would weaken the sense of international alliance against Iraq and could increase the perception in the third world that Western countries are ganging up against a smaller nation.When the crisis erupted in August, China joined the West in condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and in imposing United Nations sanctions against the Government of President Saddam Hussein. These days, Chinese officials still call for an unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, but in the next breath they call on the allied forces to show restraint."We are extremely concerned over the possible escalation of the war," said Li Zhaoxing, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, last week, "and we urge the two belligerent parties to exercise the maximum restraint to prevent the war from spreading and expanding, so as to create the necessary conditions for the efforts to find a peaceful solution."

3612	 1998	a	Dr. George H. Hitchings, who won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1988 for pharmaceutical research that led to the creation of drugs to treat leukemia, gout, malaria and disorders of the human immunity system and that eventually made organ transplants possible, died on Friday morning at his home. He was 92 and lived in Chapel Hill, N.C.He had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease, said his son, Thomas E. Hitchings.For more than 33 years, Dr. Hitchings was the chief researcher and biochemist with the Burroughs Wellcome Company in Research Triangle Park, N.C. (now Glaxo Wellcome P.L.C.). For most of his career he worked closely with Dr. Gertrude Elion, and their work led to the development of important drugs such as AZT, used to treat AIDS.The two joined forces in 1944. At the time, drug research was done on a trial-and-error basis. But Dr. Hitchings and Dr. Elion developed compounds for specific diseases, testing them in vitro and in animals, then watching for unexpected results. They perfected one new compound after another, shedding light on a variety of diseases afflicting humanity.Their work was monumental, but because they were industry scientists, they were often overlooked by the Nobel Committee. Considered by many scientists to be the founders of the field of chemotherapeutics, they were eventually awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine, nearly 30 years after most of their discoveries.
379	 2016	a	A followup on last week. This is really lovely:
3173	 2001	a	Maureen Donovan of Onoway, Alberta, warmed the hearts of Wal-Mart executives last month: she was the 50th Canadian to send in a petition begging the mass retailer to open a store nearby.''It would be a dream come true to have a rural Wal-Mart in Onoway,'' Ms. Donovan wrote from her acreage near that farming village of some 800 people, an hour's drive northwest of Edmonton. Ms. Donovan, a network planner for Canada Post who described herself as a ''longtime Wal-Mart customer,'' tossed in the suggestion that she be considered as the new store's first manager.Similarly, Carol Foote, a caregiver in Miramichi, New Brunswick, a city of some 19,000 people, organized a petition for a Wal-Mart last fall in the hope that its drawing power would help lift the local economy. ''Our city is not growing because there's nothing to draw people here,'' Ms. Foote said in a telephone interview. If people from surrounding areas came to shop at a Wal-Mart, ''maybe that night they'd go to the theater before they went home.'' With the help of two friends, Ms. Foote collected 11,276 signatures in six weeks.Such pleas are evidence of a remarkable shift in attitude toward Wal-Mart Stores, the world's biggest retailer, since its first foray into Canada seven years ago.
3990	 1996	a	Nor, I think, can the success of "Twister" be explained by the hard-sell techniques -- some call it synergy -- of modern media conglomerates. While Time Warner, whose Warner Brothers co-produced the movie, also publishes two magazines, Time and Entertainment Weekly, that heralded "Twister" with tie-in covers, the film has continued to draw colossal crowds week after week, even holding its own against the formidable competition of Tom Cruise's biceps. People just can't get enough of a weatherman who gets so turned on by chasing tornadoes that he's willing to ditch his fiancee if she insists on standing between him and his Doppler radar.Americans and weathermen -- this truly was, until "Twister," the love that dare not speak its name. But the romance has been bubbling to the surface more and more feverishly in recent years, and not just on that cable outlet for hard-core meteorological porn, the Weather Channel. Weathermen, once merely an adjunct to the morning network news shows, are now their ubiquitous court jesters -- with each network competing to cast the role with the most Falstaffian possible combination of mirth and girth. And as the network weathermen get us out of bed, so another, local crew, sometimes slimmer and sometimes female, tucks us in each night: the weather report is often held back to the very end of the 11 o'clock news, as if it were an irresistible bedtime story.No matter how high-tech the equipment surrounding these weathermen, local or network, their predictions are no more foolproof than they were back in the stone age before Doppler, Stormwatch and wind-chill factor. But that's precisely how we like it. In "Twister," when the camera actually enters a tornado, we hear a heavenly choir; a line of dialogue has already announced we are in the presence of the apocalyptic "thunder of God." The more inaccurate the weather report in the face of increased scientific expertise, the more we can be reassured that there are still some things science can't control, no matter how advanced our knowledge. America is the most religious country in the world as measured by church attendance, and accurate weather reports could set off the worst crisis of faith since Tammy Faye Bakker was stripped of her eyelashes.If "Twister 2" is going to surpass "Twister," however, they should dump that square-jawed weatherman and give the audience what it really wants in a meteorological matinee idol: Al Roker.Defense of Marriage Act Redux: Last week in this space I incorrectly stated that the wife Bob Dole divorced after 24 years of marriage was his nurse, when in fact she was an occupational therapist he met as he was leaving the hospital. Nor is she to be confused with the second Mrs. Dole, who is also no nurse, despite her considerable service to the American Red Cross.

6278	 1972	a	SCRANTON, Pa., Dec, 2— Pennsylvania has broadened its program for insuring against loss to property on the surface that results from the collapse of old underground mines.Amendments to the 1961 law setting up the insurance pro gram were signed by Gov. Mil ton J. Shapp at a ceremony this week at the Wilkes‐Barre Scranton Airport.The insurance program, for merly self‐supporting and re stricted to private dwellings, will now be subsidized by the state and its coverage will in clude any type of “structure” instead of just “homes.”Governor Shapp flew to the airport at nearby Avoca to sign the new amendments into law because most of the pressure for improving the insurance system came from legislators in the anthracite region embracing Scranton and Wilkes‐Barre.

3435	 1999	a	Israel conducted an aerial bombardment tonight of what it said were four Hezbollah guerrilla strongholds deep inside Lebanon, stung into action by a week of attacks that culminated in the killing of a general and three other Israelis in southern Lebanon earlier today.The air strikes took the conflict away from the Israeli-Lebanon border and into the heart of Lebanon, risking an escalation of ping-pong attacks between the Israeli Army and the guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Party of God, or Hezbollah.The heavy bombing ended a day of intense conflict in the low-level war in southern Lebanon, beginning with unsuccessful rocket attacks on northern Israel. The final catalyst for their attack, Israeli officials said, was a roadside bomb this morning that killed the four Israelis, including Brig. Gen. Erez Gerstein, 36, who became the highest-ranking officer to die in southern Lebanon in 16 years.A journalist, Ilan Roeh, 32, of Voice of Israel radio, was also among those killed. He was accompanying the general to ''see things up close,'' said his boss, Shalom Oren.
1561	 2010	a	Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesIf you were one of those children who read Roald Dahl’s “James and the Giant Peach” and thought the idea of living inside the giant stone fruit sounded swell, you really ought to get yourself a jar or two, or 14, of Dry Creek Peach jam.You might not be able to get 14, though. They’re not made in bulk — production is limited by the season’s crop — and the goods go fast.These jars are a byproduct of the farming done on a modest orchard in Healdsburg, Calif. The property lies in the northernmost part of Dry Creek Valley, on that patch of the verdant floor closest to Sonoma.A decade ago, a year after her son was born, Gayle Okumura Sullivan figured it was time to find the country home she and her husband, Brian Sullivan, had been casually seeking. She knew she wanted to work with land — impressive when you consider the fact that she, a high-tech marketing operative, and her spouse, a finance guy, “had no growing experience,” she says. The plan was to find a vacant property and “just decide what we wanted to grow.” What they stumbled upon was a peach-dominant farm with a few other conventional products here and there.The Sullivans honed in on the peaches, which were the property’s largest crop and its only organic one. “When we purchased the farm,” Okumura Sullivan says, “it was the only remaining peach orchard in Sonoma County, and most people expected we would replace it with grapes.”Soon the Sullivans had an entirely organic orchard devoted to stone fruit, almost all of it peaches. Now, with fewer than 1,000 trees, Dry Creek Peach generates an average of 40 tons of fruit per year, some of which goes to eateries like Chez Panisse, Cyrus and Downtown Bakery, and to specialty markets like Bi-Rite; you can also find them at area Whole Foods Markets. One portion of the harvest is sold on the premises, at the orchard’s farmstand, and another at Sonoma County farmers’ markets.That leaves a minimal percentage for canning. The number of jars depends on volume and resources. The Sullivans plant 30 varieties of peach, white and yellow, and Okumura Sullivan makes single-strain batches of at least a dozen. In order of annual appearance, these include the Red Haven, “a classic peach that’s almost old-fashioned”; the Suncrest — “it’s nice and bright”; as of last week, the Zee Lady — “a dark-skinned peach that has a dark interior and really incredible, strong flavor”; the Fair Time — “a traditional yellow peach”; the Autumn Flame — “it looks like its name”; and, in the final row, the Last Chance — “it’s beautiful.” Those are merely the yellow options. Of this year’s jarred white alternatives, the Snow King and Yukon King creations, she says, are very delicate, like the fruit, “because most white peaches are sub-acid; the tartness does not exist, making a floral and gentle jam.”Each type only lasts for a couple of weeks, and the bulk usually arrives in September, although things are running late this year. Okumura Sullivan starts canning and selling her wares immediately. “Everyone else is doing combinations with basil and pineapple,” she says. “I want to keep it to what we do and grow well. It makes a really nice, pure little product.”Pure? Yes. Little? Not quite. Big flavor is packed into every glass vessel; each one is redolent of the peach that made it. Whereas most peach preserves are watery or bland, these are the exceptions; they’re the reincarnation of summer’s end, and if you pace yourself, you can enjoy them all year ‘round.It starts at the source. “We let our fruit hang on the tree as long as is physically possible,” Okumura Sullivan says. Then there’s the formula: “It’s a combination of the fruit and sugar. That’s what preserves is as opposed to fruit spread.” While other jams tend to favor the sugar, she uses a lot of fruit, and she tries to avoid pectin.Some things to do with the jam: Okumura Sullivan, who worked under the pastry chef Christine Law at Postrio back in the day, applies a coat of the peachy spread to her dough as a base for the fresh peaches that fill her galette. (She offers a recipe for it on her Web site.) For a quick chutney, she pan-fries sweet Walla Walla onions and throws the jam on top; it’s a condiment intended for grilled pork or steak.Looking for a lunchbox special? Here’s a preparation that doesn’t require any cooking at all: the AB&J. Split a baguette and slather it with equal parts almond butter and some of the Dry Creek Peach jam. Give it a try on a rainy day when that first autumn chill creeps in.Or eat it now. If you can get your hands on a jar of Okumura Sullivan’s Santa Rosa plum jam, eat that, too, with a mild goat cheese.
4880	 1991	a	"We're starting to be able to pick up the defensive momentum the way we were able to under Coach Pitino," said Mark Jackson, who watched from the bench as rookie Greg Anthony used his quick feet to defend against Isiah Thomas for all but the final seconds of the fourth quarter. "The defense is different because we don't go full-court. But we're starting to be able to pick it up a notch in the half-court, and at important times in the game."Before anyone gets carried away, it would be wise to consider who the competition was. The fading Pistons (7-9), two-time National Basketball Association champions, still bring an admirable ethic to work, but appear to have fallen a couple of crucial notches in their levels of chemistry and execution.Even what Knicks Coach Pat Riley described as their "tactics" didn't help them yesterday. Early in the second quarter, with Ewing posting up in the lane against Bill Laimbeer, Laimbeer fell backward and to the floor, in small part from minimal contact and in large part from one of his notorious flops. Laimbeer got the call, and Ewing a techical foul, but John Salley fell over Laimbeer and injured his left knee. The 7-foot front courtman, Detroit's most active shot-blocking presence, was suspected to have suffered damage to his anterior cruciate ligament.It also didn't help the Pistons, nor hurt the Knicks' growing defensive egos, that small forward Mark Aguirre, after piling up 18 first-half points, injured his right elbow and played only the first few minutes of the third quarter. That left Detroit's offense in the hands of Thomas, who scored 17 points, and his slumping backcourt partner, Joe Dumars, who had 15. Of Us and ThemBehind Gerald Wilkins's 8 points to close the second quarter, the Knicks reduced Detroit's lead to a workable 56-48. Then the Pistons committed a rash of early third-quarter fouls, worked their way into the penalty at the 9:19 mark and paid for it. As the Knicks took their 60-56 lead, 8 of their 12 points came at the line.

1597	 2010	a	Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.New York, Nov. 2, 1860Young Republicans with axes! New York firemen run amok!Welcome to election week, 1860.Hurled brickbats, smashed glass and howled curses were the soundtrack of American electoral politics a century and a half ago. The oratorical eloquence that most people today associate with the 19th century — those resonant fanfares of prose carved upon monuments, enshrined in history textbooks, hammered into the brains of 10th graders — often provided little more than the faintest melodic line, drowned out amid the percussive din. Last week’s notorious “head-stomping” incident outside a Senate debate in Kentucky, footage of which has drawn nationwide condemnation and half a million views on YouTube, seems almost gentle in comparison.On the last Friday night before the 1860 election, Senator William H. Seward delivered a rousing Republican campaign address to a large outdoor gathering on 14th Street in Manhattan. Afterward, crowds of pro-Lincoln “Wide Awakes” fanned out through the surrounding area. Wide Awakes, members of an organization with strong paramilitary overtones, could be a menacing sight: they wore military-style caps and shrouded themselves in long black capes made of a shiny fabric that reflected the flames of the torches they carried. Some strapped axes to their backs, in tribute to their rail-splitting hero.The Library of CongressAccording to the next day’s Times and other papers, things began to spin out of control when supporters of a rival presidential contender, John Bell, charged toward the Lincoln men, “calling them ‘negro stealers,’ ‘sons of b____s,’ &c.” At the corner of 12th Street and Fourth Avenue, several dozen volunteer firemen — members of Engine Company 23 — joined the fray, swinging roundhouse blows with clubs and heavy iron wrenches that the Wide Awakes tried to parry with their torches. But the tide of battle turned when the young Republicans brought their Lincoln axes into play. They chased the enemy back into the company firehouse and promptly began smashing down its barricaded doors, as other idealistic marchers flung bricks and cobblestones. (News reports are vague about what finally ended the fracas.)Related Civil War Timeline Follow events as they unfolded 150 years ago, see pages from the archives and explore past posts organized around the major themes, places and personalities of the war. See the Timeline »Similar disturbances happened almost daily in various East Coast cities. In Baltimore the previous night, Republican marchers had been pelted with stones and rotten eggs. (That city was justly known as “Mobtown”; dozens sometimes died in a single campaign season there.) In Washington on Election Day itself, pro-slavery forces stormed a Wide Awake clubhouse a block or two from the Capitol. The attackers practically demolished the building and were only narrowly prevented from burning the ruin — along with several Wide Awakes trapped on the third floor — by the timely arrival of police.There was little talk of bipartisan civility during that particular election cycle.Sources:New York Times, Nov. 3, 1860; New York Tribune, Nov. 3, 1860; New York Herald, Nov. 5, 1860; Baltimore Sun, Nov. 2, 1860; Public Ledger (Philadelphia), Nov. 3, 1860; Jon Grinspan, “‘Young Men for War’: The Wide Awakes and Lincoln’s 1860 Presidential Campaign” (Journal of American History, September 2009); David Grimsted, “American Mobbing, 1828-1861: Toward Civil War.”Adam Goodheart is the author of the forthcoming book “1861: The Civil War Awakening.” He lives in Washington, D.C., and on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where he is the Hodson Trust-Griswold Director of Washington College’s C.V.

4275	 1994	a	And because this network of parallel streets is all under the jurisdiction of the City of Los Angeles, rather than a patchwork of smaller municipalities, it is relatively simple for state and local officials to work together on a designated smart corridor, which was nearing completion when the earthquake struck. The smart corridor includes sensors embedded in the road that calculate the speed and number of vehicles, closed-circuit television monitors that let transportation officials watch traffic and changeable message signs urging motorists to try other routes.These innovations let state and local transportation officials assess how well the detours are working around the 3.4 miles of closed freeway and to fine-tune the system, which was put in place within hours of the quake.The system involves two detours in each direction, shorter ones for cars carrying two or more passengers and longer ones for single drivers, who face a $271 fine for cheating. The 1976 experiment defined a car pool by the more onerous standard of three or more passengers.The number of motorists choosing the car pool detours, although low, has steadily increased: 700 during the peak hour of the morning eastbound drive and 1,100 during the peak hours of the morning westbound drive and the afternoon drives in both directions. Cutting DelaysState transportation officials wonder if the relatively low car pool numbers are a result of how well they have fine-tuned the detours. Early on, delays beyond normal driving time for solo commuters were as long as 27 minutes, while for car pools it was about 6 minutes. Now, delays hover at six minutes and one minute, respectively.The improvement is a result of re-marking ramps to create two narrow lanes where there had been one; adding a second left-turn lane at difficult intersections, and increasing the number of orange detour signs so fewer people make mistakes along the way."We got things going good before we got a car pool mindset in place," said Perry Lowdin, the state's deputy chief of traffic operations. "It wasn't hard enough for long enough."

3497	 1999	a	Allan Carr, the producer behind the popular movie musical ''Grease'' and the Tony Award-winning Broadway hit ''La Cage aux Folles,'' died on Tuesday at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 62 and also had a home in Palm Springs, Calif.The cause was liver cancer, Ronni Chasen, a longtime friend, said.In a varied career that included stints as a publicist and manager, Mr. Carr was noted for his shrewd timing and keen nose for new talent. He was perhaps just as renowned for his penchant for camp, most notably as the producer of the 1989 Academy Awards telecast. That show's opening number featured a squeaky-voiced Snow White singing ''Proud Mary'' with the actor Rob Lowe, prompting legal action by the Walt Disney Company.A party-giver par excellence who favored ''large-man caftans'' during the 1970's, Mr.Carr once feted Truman Capote in an abandoned Los Angeles jail.Reared in Highland Park, Ill., Mr. Carr attended Lake Forest College and entered show business after studying briefly at Northwestern University. His first venture was as one of the creators of the Playboy Penthouse Television series, which helped pave the way for Hugh Hefner's Playboy clubs. He was also responsible for the opening of the Civic Theater in Chicago, where he underwrote ''The World of Carl Sandburg,'' with Bette Davis and Gary Merrill; Tyrone Guthrie's production of ''Mary Stuart,'' starring Eva Le Gallienne, and Tennessee Williams's ''Garden District,'' with Cathleen Nesbitt and Diana Barrymore.

4535	 1993	a	"That's the game plan," he said."Basically I think it's pretty clear that people are very dissatisfied with the educational system. They are ready to do something radical. Once their reservations are addressed in a new voucher initiative with the kind of protections people want, I think we've got a winner."He pointed to a poll by an independent research organization, Policy Analysis for California Education, that found that 63 percent of Californians favor the concept of vouchers.But, addressing elements that are absent from Proposition 174, the poll found that 87 percent believe that private schools should meet state academic, fiscal and safety requirements; 60 percent believe that they should hire only certified teachers, and 82 percent believe that they should be required to provide additional support for students with special needs.While opponents campaign against the proposal in these areas of vulnerability, analysts worry about its broader implications in a state that has become increasingly fragmented by cultural and ethnic differences. They say the plan would weaken one of the last remaining institutions that offers a common experience to most Americans."If there is any hope of articulating commonalities and common values, it is in the public schools," said Sherry Bebitch-Jeffe, a political scientist at Claremont Graduate School. "This idea will exacerbate an already Balkanized situation. Already the public schools are far more minority than white and the private schools are more white than minority."Warren Furutani, a member of the Los Angeles Board of Education, said: "It is clear that the vouchers will benefit those who have the mobility and the additional dollars to go to the private system. Those who are left behind will be relegated to the back seat of society for the rest of their lives."Critics note that many poor inner city children could not make use of the vouchers because they would not cover the tuition of many private schools. In addition, no provision is made in the measure for school transportation, meaning that poor children might not have access to the better schools.

3461	 1999	a	The American Government is shouldering a modest number of the immigrants in comparison with some of its NATO allies, and has been facing pressure from Macedonia and Germany -- which has already resettled 10,000 of the 24,000 Kosovar Albanians it pledged to take in.Mr. Shala said he prays that the rest of his family will make its way from Kosovo to Macedonia, perhaps at the border crossing in Lojan and Blace, where United Nations relief workers said more than 10,000 Kosovar Albanians have arrived since Monday. Last week, in a phone call to Macedonia, Mr. Shala spoke with the brothers and cousin he has already offered to take in. ''They said to me, 'We don't have food to eat, a place to sleep,' '' Mr. Shala recalled. ''They said, 'Please, do something for us.' ''''I have to do something for my people,'' he said.Shehide Berisha, an actress, said she has been checking an Internet site, www.refugjat.org, where a nonprofit organization is posting the names and locations of more than 63,000 ethnic Albanians, looking for news of her parents and her brother.The family has been scattered across Europe by the conflict, with her father in Pristina while her mother, who is diabetic, was sent on to Albania. ''My Mom is a Catholic, so she is going to a Catholic church where they give her insulin,'' Ms. Berisha said. A sister and her three children have made it to Germany.Ms. Berisha heard that her brother had managed to Pristina, to stay with an uncle. ''Later, I heard that 70 people were killed in the neighborhood where my uncle lives,'' she said. She did not know if her relatives were among them.Jerry Gjonbalaj, a 32-year-old restaurant manager in Tuckahoe, N.Y., said that Serb paramilitary forces had given his extended family of 23 people half an hour to leave their home in Pec, Kosovo. Now, they were stateless and scattered -- in Albania, Macedonia and Bosnia. ''We're all just kind of lost,'' he said.''I think about my Mom and the other part of my family there, and what they're going through,'' Mr. Gjonbalaj said. ''It makes it hard to show love to my wife and kids here.'' Because he did not know where his family is, he could not apply for them to come here.

3440	 1999	a	The nation's central bank said today that it is conducting an investigation into accusations that several domestic and foreign financial institutions used inside information about an impending shift in exchange-rate policy in January to profit from the devaluation of the currency.The assertions -- first made public in February by Aloizio Mercadante, a member of Congress from the opposition Workers Party -- include charges that nine banks used access to Government officials in the days leading up to the Jan. 13 policy shift to make trading decisions resulting in a combined profit of roughly $1 billion. The list of banks includes Citigroup, J. P. Morgan and BankBoston.Many banks in recent weeks have reported preliminary results to the central bank showing they made substantial profits after the devaluation of the currency, the real, largely through a combination of successful bets in futures markets and purchases of dollar-linked Government bonds. The enormous size of these profits comes as the economy is struggling with recession, and has resulted in calls by several members of Congress to look into the legality of such financial results.This week, Senator Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, the president of the Senate and a man widely considered Brazil's most powerful legislator, said he would support a Congressional inquiry into the accusations that some banks used inside information to profit from the devaluation. That move is separate from the central bank's investigation.
508	 2016	a	How these directors reach Hollywood can be decidedly more modern than the paths earlier generations traveled. The Uruguayan director Fede Alvarez came to Hollywood’s attention through a 2009 short film that went viral, “Panic Attack,” a resourceful imagining of an alien invasion of Montevideo. Hollywood agencies, studios and managers started calling the day after it was posted, and Mr. Alvarez was soon on a plane to Los Angeles. He went on to direct the 2013 remake of Sam Raimi’s scrappy 1981 classic, “The Evil Dead.”“I always joke about the fact that when I go in and pitch something with some accent,” Mr. Alvarez said by phone, “it just makes the whole thing sound more interesting.”His new film, “Don’t Breathe,” which opened Aug. 26, follows three teenage burglars in Detroit who meet their match in a blind veteran. Mr. Alvarez is next set to direct “Monsterpocalypse,” an adaptation of a board game. But Mr. Alvarez, 38, attributes his success to developing his skills far from Hollywood. He started shooting shorts at 7, studied screenwriting in Amsterdam and established a postproduction house in Uruguay before making the leap.“I was working so long in such an isolated place,” Mr. Alvarez said. “That way, by the time Hollywood finds you, you’re so prepared. When they find other filmmakers at an earlier moment in their careers, they’re not so prepared — and then that becomes their chance, and then it never happens again.”

4846	 1991	a	The woman, who said the initials C. J. are not her own, said she felt no remorse. "I blame it on men, period," she said, adding, "I'm doing it to all the men because it was a man that gave it to me."During the interview, Mr. Johnson repeatedly urged the woman to seek counseling. She continues to call him, he said Thursday. Once she told him she contracted the AIDS virus from a white bisexual man, he said. He said he arranged for her to talk with a minister, but "I don't think we have made a lot of headway with her."Some people who call Mr. Johnson argue that C. J.'s story is a hoax.Charles O'Neal, publisher of The Dallas Examiner, a weekly newspaper whose readership is largely black, said that though no one can be sure whether it is a hoax he believes that the story has stirred intense public discussion among blacks about heterosexual AIDS transmission. "I am certain there is some communitywide consternation that C. J. is one of a number of people who are out there wreaking havoc with this disease," he said.Health officials said the number of heterosexual men seeking information about AIDS has greatly increased in recent weeks in Dallas County."In the past, people seemed to be a lot more judgmental about people who get this disease," said Phillip Mathews, director of minority services at the AIDS Interfaith Network. "Now they are showing serious concern because it could hit very close to home. C. J. could be a blessing, in a sad sort of way."At R. J.'s on the Lake, a fashionable disco on Dallas's northwest side, the manager, Jerry Sanders, said business was as brisk as ever but "people's attitudes about high-risk behavior have changed enormously, thanks to C. J." Drop in PromiscuityMany of those at the bar agreed. "If what this woman says is true, we are talking about a form of genocide," said Levi Peterson 3d, a 32-year-old accountant. "It is serial killing. But true or not, promiscuity has de-elevated, believe me."
2677	 2004	a	A federal appeals court has ruled that the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, which operates the transit system in Boston, violated the free speech rights of a group that advocates marijuana use by banning its advertisements four years ago. The court said the authority had engaged in "viewpoint discrimination" by rejecting three advertisements from the group, Change the Climate, as the agency did not have the right to reject advertisements because it disagreed with their content. The general manager of the authority, Michael H. Mulhern, said the agency did not allow the advertisements because it felt they were intended for children. Katie Zezima (NYT)

5659	 1986	a	Mikhail S. Gorbachev's four-day visit to New Delhi, which ended Friday, was widely seen to have strengthened India's friendship with the Soviet Union. But there was no evidence that the two countries had advanced their military ties or lessened New Delhi's determination to look to the West for help in developing high-technology weapons systems.Senior Indian officials said military questions had been peripheral to the nearly 10 hours of talks between Mr. Gorbachev and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and that such matters had been discussed more in the months leading up to the visit, particularly during a recent trip to Moscow by the Indian Defense Minister, Arun Singh.''We asked for no arms deals and got none,'' said an Indian diplomat. ''Seeking those kinds of agreements is just not our style.''Reassurances and DemurralsIndian officials said the talks were important because of their focus on what India perceives as its security threat from China and Pakistan. Although no new Indian-Soviet security accords were said to have been signed or agreed to, Indian officials said they felt reassured.

5391	 1987	a	SOMETIMES the question is not so much what's in a name as it is what's in a place?The thought was prompted by the local furor in Suffolk County about the name of Shirley, the village on Sunrise Highway Extension near the south end of South Haven Park (Yaphank is at the north end). There are those who would like to change the name of Shirley to Floyd Harbor, and there are those who have vowed that they will never renounce Shirley.There is no evidence of sexism in the debate between Shirley and Floyd, none of the kind of thing that resulted in the weather people's finally deciding to use male as well as female names when it comes to hurricanes. A community is not a hurricane, although a name change may sometimes indicate which way the wind is blowing.When Constantinople, which is not on Long Island but in Turkey, became Istanbul, one knew that there had been a change in management, from Greek to Turk. In Northern Ireland, the Irish Catholics call the border city Derry, while those with strong Empire leanings keep it on the map as Londonderry. Jerusalem, the Hebrew and best-known name of the Israeli city, which was in Roman times Aeolia Capitolina, is known to the Arabs as Al-Kuds, the Holy Place.Suffolk's neighbor to the west, the town of Nieuw Amsterdam, suddenly became New York in 1664, when the British conquerors retired the Dutch founders. The venerable Long Island Historical Society recently changed its name to the Brooklyn Historical Society, in keeping with its Brooklyn Heights location. In early years, Brooklyn, its own city, was widely acknowledged to be on Long Island and, indeed, was the place where Washington's 1776 battle with the British took place.
3528	 1999	a	More than a month after signing a letter of intent to acquire the Islanders, Bob Gutkowski's $180 million bid to buy the team is moving slowly, with no certainty of success.Gutkowski's group must satisfy the Islanders' owners, Howard and Edward Milstein, and Steven Gluckstern, that it possesses sufficient financing to complete the purchase. It must also satisfy the demands of John Pickett, the former Islanders owner, who is owed tens of millions of dollars in deferred payments. Paying off Pickett may require a restructuring of his deal.''I've been talking to the Gutkowski group and the stumbling block is the due diligence it's doing on the team and deciding whether to go ahead or not,'' said Mort Certilman, Nassau County's chief negotiator with the team for a new arena to replace Nassau Coliseum.Gutkowski declined to comment.The due diligence involves examining the finances and operations of the franchise, which lost $20 million last season, to assess its worth. After the process, the agreed-upon sale price could be adjusted up or down. RICHARD SANDOMIR

285	 2017	a	MONDAY PUZZLE — And so, the holiday season has officially ended for another year. Time to get back to work, right? Maybe it’s O.K. to ease into it.Today’s ThemeOf course, we all don’t float from soiree to soiree through this part of winter — I confess to usually losing the fight against hibernation — but Jan. 2 notoriously hits with a thud, this year on a Monday, no less. Although that meant the solve was pretty quick, there was a clever and well-timed little theme that made it satisfying.If you knew any of the four longest down clues, you filled in four bubbles in each that spelled some sort of jubilation. The dead-center down clue, 21D — “Really revel …” — reiterated and corresponded to the theme phrase, which was its answer.I was inspired to hunt for the origin of the theme phrase, PARTY DOWN, and got nothing earlier than 1970s references, starting with a 1974 summer soul song by Little Beaver. Maybe someone has more scholarly information for the comments; there’s no doubt that there’s a funkiness to the expression but funk has existed in other forms throughout history, hasn’t it?

1275	 2011	a	Kirsten Luce for The New York TimesFor Mind and Body Stretch is a monthly series on yoga. Tell us about your yoga practice or post a comment.As I lay in savasana at Yoga High on the Lower East Side, intoxicated by the sound of a bluesy harmonica, it struck me that yoga and music belong together, like a popping fire on a snowy day.Not everyone agrees. Musical taste is overwhelmingly subjective (a Boy George oldie during pigeon pose is not easily forgiven) and pacing is critical (a hip-hop warm-up is too fast, too soon). And there is nothing inherently wrong with silence — the music of choice for many traditionalists. It helps focus the breath and settle the mind, and some slower-moving forms of yoga, like Iyengar, demand it.But in these particularly morose times, I can appreciate the yoga that stretches beyond discipline into playfulness. There is nothing like Bob Marley or Nina Simone to usher a sense of joy and awe into a class. Good music only deepens my connection to the practice in a way that unending cycles of Kirtan chants, predictable New Age music and conventional Indian tunes do not.Body Rhythms Here is a selection of songs from the playlists of teachers in the New York area. Mel Russo is co-owner of Yoga High on the Lower East Side, where she teaches vinyasa yoga.

BligeSPELL by Patti SmithCLOSING PRAYERS by Bhagavan DasI’m not alone. More teachers today take their playlists very seriously, particularly those who teach vinyasa, a dancelike style of yoga that is perfectly suited to many different kinds of music. This, coupled with the ease of downloading from the Internet and arranging playlists, allows teachers to roam into more musically imaginative territory. Musicians and D.J.’s, also increasingly attuned to the yoga vibe, are crafting music with yoga in mind.Mel Russo, a co-owner of Yoga High, spends hours shaping her playlists. It shows. During one recent class we rose to Warrior I to the dance vibe of “Gypsy Woman” by Crystal Waters and segued into “Here Comes the Sun” (the Nina Simone version remixed by Francois K.).She ended another class with the M. Ward version of David Bowie’s “Let’s Dance,” and that gorgeous, slow, harmonica-infused song made my savasana all the more blissful. After class, those intrigued by the tune were sure to ask Ms. Russo who sang it. (She often posts her playlists on the studio’s Facebook page.)“I have taken some classes with music and I wanted to …,” Ms. Russo says, pretending to slash her wrists. Ms. Russo, a phenomenal teacher who helps runs one of the friendliest studios in the city, said teachers have to be aware of the ebb and flow of a class. “I’ve become more obsessed,” she said. “And I’ve gotten a huge response. And the more people who respond to yoga, the better it is.”“It takes time, and not everything works,” she added.True enough. It is risky. Some music can turn people off or even drive them away altogether. Many teachers don’t have the touch or the skill to blend music with yoga. Brette Popper, who publishes the popular YogaCity Web site, still cringes at the thought of Bruce Springsteen rasping away in a class. “I don’t care for him in a yoga class,” she said.She prefers practicing yoga without music. “With music you tend to lose yourself in the music itself as opposed to listening to your body and breath,” Ms. Popper said. “Music to me can get in the way of the practice.”At an Equinox on the Upper East Side, Derek Beres brings his own brand of music to class. A yogi, D.J. and music writer, he has teamed with the producer Dave Schommer, known as “Duke Mushroom,” to create EarthRise SoundSystem. (Their full-length album is titled “The Yoga Sessions.”) The idea was to reinvent yoga music, which they do by drawing overwhelmingly on global rhythms that are heavy on percussion.He also focuses on pacing. Well into Mr. Beres’s challenging class at Equinox, his playlist slid into a Middle Eastern tune, “Egypt by Air” (by Bombay Dub Orchestra). Then, as the class wound down, a recognizable voice chimed in: It was Marvin Gaye asking at just the right moment, “Is That Enough?” Mr. Beres occasionally walked to the sound system to adjust the volume, eager to get each track, and the mood, just right.“I’ve taken the music very seriously,” said Mr. Beres, who was the D.J. at the holiday party at Laughing Lotus recently. In Mr. Beres’s playlists, which he creates every Sunday, he prefers midtempo drum music without a lot of vocals. Jazz also makes frequent appearances. “You are looking for a sense of trance and trying to give people that meditative sense,” he said.That is also the case with Aarona Pichinson’s class at YogaWorks in SoHo. One evening, she used “Chocolate Elvis (Bullitnuts Version 1)” (by the electronic group Tosca) and “Circlesongs” (Bobby McFerrin) to encourage the yoginis in the room to push past a series of trying balancing poses. Ms. Pichinson often chooses music with Indian undertones, only edgier, more electronic and psychedelic sounding. Swing music also crops up. And rounding out the mix was a song from Ladysmith Black Mambazo, which, with its mad percussion, was the perfect antidote to both the atrocious weather outside and the waning energy inside.

4809	 1991	a	The new rulers of Ethiopia are convening a conference in Addis Ababa on Monday to form a more broadly based provisional government -- a step viewed as vital to healing the ethnically divided, financially strapped country after years of civil war and famine.But the meeting of Ethiopian factions, including the three rebel fronts that worked together to overthrow the Soviet-backed regime of the past 14 years, is expected to put off for the time being an issue critical to the country's long-term unity. That is the question of whether the province of Eritrea in the north of the country should become independent, an outcome favored by the rebel organization now in control there.The meeting is taking place largely at the urging of the United States, the main foreign mediator in the Ethiopian conflict. Washington won a pledge that such a conference would be held from the front led by rebels from Tigre Province. In return, Washington gave political support to that group's takeover of Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, last month. Possibility of Economic HelpA senior American diplomat said that if the Tigrean-led front can form an ethnically diverse government, then Western governments and the World Bank may show more interest in economic support for Ethiopia. Under the Marxist-Leninist rule of Lieut. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam, Washington gave large amounts of humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia, but because of the Mengistu Government's poor human rights record there was no economic assistance.

5553	 1986	a	The executives drew up a ''storybook'' - a page-by-page runthrough of which garment would appear on which page and what size child would wear it. Babies would come first, then toddlers, then pre-teens. ''The natural order of things,'' Mr. Freedman said.Planning was so precise that, in some cases, even the pose of the child was determined in advance. ''There's a lot of superstition in this business,'' Mr. Wyker said. ''If an item has sold well displayed in a certain fashion -if a coat, for example, is shown open - then the catalogue company will insist that it be shown the same way the next time around.'' 'Personality and Looks'Last week, dozens of models between 3 and 12 years of age were screened by representatives of Bright's Creek and Allied Graphic. There will be 64 shots of children wearing clothes in the 56-page catalogue, and between 35 and 40 models will be photographed. Those who were hired - at the general rate of about $60 an hour - had the right combination of ''animation, personality and looks,'' according to Richard Stastny, art director of the catalogue.Also important is the right ethnic mix and the correct variety of heights. The cover, for example, will feature four children, and the Bright's Creek staff had hired Steven, 8-year-old Taina Mia Rivera and 11-year-old Alex Outhred when they realized they needed a blond girl, 46 inches tall, to complete the desired stepping-stone effect. They found just that in 5-year-old Martina Dance.Many in the industry argue that the cover is the most important photo in a catalogue because the entire effort is wasted if a customer is not drawn to look inside. When Chadwick's of Boston, another Allied Graphic client, began its catalogue three years ago, the first few covers featured such well-known faces as Brooke Shields and Christie Brinkley, who commanded fees as high as $30,000.On an afternoon last week, the four lesser-known and much younger models hired by Bright's Creek found themselves in front of the cameras of Bruce Plotkin in a studio near lower Fifth Avenue. Seeing Eye to EyeIn the world of catalogues, there are photographers who specialize in everything from food to heavy machinery. Mr. Plotkin specializes in photographing children, getting down on his knees so they see eye to eye, talking their language, making them laugh at just the right moment.
5205	 1988	a	''Social dynamite'' is one way to define poor children who lack education and sound parental supervision. ''Overwhelmed'' is a way to define poor mothers who lack education and self-esteem. How to help the children and the mothers is a question that can overwhelm, too - so much that it may induce paralysis even among the most well meaning.To look at a parent-child educational program in San Antonio called Avance, however, is to get an answer. You start when the baby is born.In 1970 a schoolteacher named Gloria Rodriguez, herself a child of the San Antonio barrios, was given her first class of first-graders. Young as they were, the school system had more or less given up on them: they'd been labeled ''retarded,'' ''slow'' or, even more finally, ''uneducable.''Because they were all Hispanics Mrs. Rodriguez assumed that their problems lay in never having had a bilingual teacher before. Not so: the children were as deficient in Spanish as they were in English. And although Mrs. Rodriguez readied all but five for the second grade, it was clear even then that they would never really catch up. Their education had to begin when their lives began, with their parents as teachers. That's true for all children, but these parents didn't know how to do the job.
6042	 1977	a	The Queens District Attorney, John J. Santucci, called upon a Supreme Court justice yesterday to put on trial a 64year‐old man charged with murder and arson, who had obtained more than 50 postponements because of a serious heart condition.In arguing for the trial, Martin Bracken, an assistant district attorney who is in charge of homicide cases, told Justice George Balbach of Supreme Court:“The defendant's claim is without merit, for it would confer immunity upon him from criminal prosecution not only for the indictment herein but for all past, present and, for that matter, future conduct.“Moreover, by the defendant's reasoning, any defendant with a similar condition, regardless of the number and nature of the crime or crimes, would be immune from criminal sanctions by reason of physical illness.”The defendant, Samuel Piazza of 214‐15 86th Avenue, Queens Village, was charged with having collaborated with his son, William, in hiring a handyman to firebomb three stores that the elder Mr. .Pizza owned at 218th Street and Jamaica Avenue, Queens Village. The buildings were firebombed on March 15, 1973. Subsequently, the body of John Donnelly, alleged to have been hired to destroy the buildings, was found in the wreckage.
2667	 2004	a	KABUL, Afghanistan, Oct. 31 - Militants holding three foreign United Nations staff members in Afghanistan released a videotape on Sunday showing their hostages, and they said the three would be killed if demands for the release of prisoners and the withdrawal of foreign troops were not met by noon Wednesday.The video, delivered to the Arab news network Al Jazeera and broadcast Sunday morning, was the strongest indication yet that the group Jaish-e-Muslimeen, or Army of Muslims, was holding the hostages as it has claimed, and was adopting the media-oriented tactics of kidnapping groups in Iraq.The three hostages -- Angelito Nayan, a Filipino diplomat, and two women who are election workers, Annetta Flanigan from Northern Ireland and Shqipe Hebibi from Kosovo -- were seized Thursday from their car on a busy street in Kabul. They appeared unharmed but drawn in the video, sitting together against a wall. They were guarded by a militant with a black-and-white checkered scarf wrapped around his face.Leaders of Jaish-e-Muslimeen issued their conditions in telephone calls to news agencies on Sunday. They demanded that the United Nations and the United States and other foreign nations withdraw their forces from Afghanistan, that all of their Muslim prisoners in Afghanistan and Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, be released and that military and police operations to find the hostages and their captors be halted.
3856	 1997	a	SOMETHING about midsummer turns ray guns and missiles and marauding spaceships into old news. Suddenly the most ferocious weapon on the movie screen is the English language, as deployed so viciously by scheming, Mamet-fueled white-collar workers in Neil LaBute's stunning Sundance prize winner, ''In the Company of Men.'' At this time of year, the big guns are silenced long enough to make way for such sleepers, and they come as the perfect break between early summer's fireworks and the fall's more complex art house fare. What a jolt: we find ourselves surrounded by films by, for and about real people on planet Earth.The culture shock of this backlash against studio extravagance is heightened by the free-for-all atmosphere that increasingly shapes the summer season. Summer counter-programming started out as a small idea, with a few art house Davids mixed in among gun-toting Hollywood Goliaths, but now it has truly caught fire. As a result, nearly all the highlights of this year's Sundance Film Festival, along with a few notable successes from Cannes and elsewhere on the festival circuit, will be competing for similar audiences during a tight midseason time period. But this year there are fewer clear standouts. And there may be more small, deserving films than the traffic will bear.Still, the oversupply of interesting independent films is the kind of problem we can welcome. Whether startlingly assured work (Mr. LaBute's film) or just a highly promising debut (Miguel Arteta's ''Star Maps''), each of these films bodes well for a thriving independent film world. The further good news is that a cycle of slouchy, myopic coming-of-age films has given way to much more adventurous subject matter and that the independent film world often outdoes Hollywood in blending intellect with humor. In a year that began with ''The Daytrippers'' and ''Chasing Amy'' and today brings the acerbic cleverness of the Australian ''Love Serenade'' (both a Cannes and Sundance entry), it's clear that sly, single-minded thinking is alive and well.Strong personality is the hallmark of every one of these films, for better or worse. Running the risk of abrasive self-importance is always a liability for independents, but excesses can be exhilarating when they come from the heart. Tom DiCillo's ''Box of Moonlight'' dares to resurrect the hippie-dropout scenario of the 1970's (with considerable fresh energy, and with a much lighter touch than the thematically similar ''Dream With the Fishes''). And late this month comes ''She's So Lovely,'' a fiery revival of John Cassavetes's punch-drunk romanticism as filtered through the eyes of Nick Cassavetes, the filmmaker's son.
3941	 1996	a	The Deluxe Corporation said yesterday that it planned to close more than half its check-printing plants and to eliminate 1,200 jobs in the next two years. The company said it would record expenses of $30 million to $35 million in the first quarter to pay for the closings. Deluxe, which previously said it would close five plants, said yesterday that it would close 21 more, leaving 15 open. The company, based in St. Paul, estimated that the closings would affect 2,400 full-time and 600 part-time workers at the 26 plants. The company said, however, that it expected to add as many as 1,800 positions to the remaining plants by expanding the number of work shifts. The company said it expected more staff cuts in the next two years.
1801	 2008	a	DES MOINES — The Des Moines Register poll, which showed Senator Barack Obama pulling away from Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and former Senator John Edwards, had some interesting numbers below the top line. (To refresh your memory: Mr. Obama had 32 percent, Mrs. Clinton 25 percent and Mr. Edwards 24 percent.)For one thing, it showed women supporting Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton equally. If this is the case, that’s obviously bad news for Mrs. Clinton, who has based her campaign on drawing a disproportionate share of women.Both the Clinton and Edwards campaigns say the poll is flawed. It is out of line with other recent polls and the caucuses are notoriously difficult to forecast. But it showed 32 percent of women going to both Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton. Only 20 percent favor Mr. Edwards.At the same time, men favor Mr. Obama and Mr. Edwards equally, at 31 percent and 30 percent respectively. The glaring deficit is men for Mrs. Clinton; only 16 percent support her.Other polls have also shown that men are less comfortable with Mrs. Clinton than with her male rivals. That is all the more reason her campaign needs to shore up any lagging support among women.But Ann Lewis, a senior adviser to Mrs. Clinton who oversees the women’s vote, saysMrs. Clinton’s support among women continues to be strong and that because the poll oversampled independents, its results are “out of whack.”“This poll has more to do with a change in sampling technique than any change of opinion among Democratic women,” she said. “We’ve had six or eight in the last three days and all of those except one had the race very close.”The Register poll did fall in line with some broad trends that other surveys have indicated for some time:By big margins, Mr. Obama draws young people (56 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds), those with college degrees (39 percent), those making more than $70,000 (37 percent), and those living in urban areas (37 percent).Mrs. Clinton bests her two rivals only among those with no more than a high school diploma (32 percent) and those who identify themselves as Democrats (33 percent). She ties Mr. Edwards for support among people 55 or older (30 percent) and essentially ties Mr. Obama among those who make less than $50,000 (28 percent, with Mr. Obama at 27 percent).An MSNBC poll of Iowa caucus-goers, conducted Dec. 26-28, for example, had Mrs. Clinton ahead among women, with 28 percent for her, 21 percent for Mr. Obama and 20 percent for Mr. Edwards.

1312	 2011	a	Ruth Fremson/The New York TimesSATURDAY’S PUZZLE — I just don’t understand some people. If someone you know happens to be a practicing physician, wouldn’t you think that the last thing they’d encourage you to consume is a crunchy, sticky treat? And yet, that’s just what Mark Diehl does today. Shame on you, Dr. Diehl. And you call yourself a dentist.It’s so worth it, too. I will confess that I used to be afraid of Saturday puzzles but this one, while challenging, seems friendly. The entries are fabulous, a veritable time line of pop culture from mid-20th century right up through the video game generation’s The Legend of ZELDA. They’re not so hard to get that I couldn’t successfully leap to a new sector after I had gotten the previous one to fall. The crossing 15s are wonderful.And, oh, the wordplay. Today’s puzzle had enough clever misdirection to keep me very happy. It might frustrate some people, but I admire a well-turned clue. Take 4 Down. RUES is a word we see a lot in crosswords, and it’s usually clued in terms of regret. Not today. “Ways of Charles de Gaulle” is the kind of clue that gives me a double frisson: first, when I realize that I don’t know anything about the man de Gaulle, especially nothing that is four letters long and will really have to think differently about what I’m seeing; second, when I finally fill it in, perhaps from the crossings, and that smack-yourself-in-the-forehead feeling kicks in when I realize that I’ve been had. Good times.It’s the same with “Cab alternative.” Ever try to hail a taxi in New York City during rush hour? It’s impossible. I’ve seen taxicabs virtually vaporize into thin air when they see someone with their hand out. An alternative, maybe a metered magic carpet, would be nice. But is Dr. Diehl really talking about a taxicab here? No, he is not. Pour yourself a glass of ZIN and ponder that one for a while.I’d never heard of a RAKEHELL, but I like the word. Similarly, most of American Bandstand’s run took place before my time: did Dick Clark ever refer to his audience as TEENERS?Still, a masterful example of what a Saturday puzzle should be. I’m going to go brush my teeth.Your thoughts?

5160	 1989	a	Come down the hill, go north from Winchcombe for a couple of miles, and you jump over 3,000 years in time. Hailes Abbey was a Cistercian foundation, one of Henry VIII's victims during the dissolution of the monasteries. Today it is an elegant ruin, its golden cloisters glowing against a dark backdrop of trees. It has the melancholy and perfection of many ruins, making you feel that it can never have been other than it is now, with a few visitors wandering around the archways trying to puzzle out the arrangement of the abbey church, the refectory and wood pigeons moaning in the chestnuts. It is only when you go into the little museum that you begin to glimpse the realities of that vanished monastic empire - in which a great monastery presided over an area, extracting wealth from far and wide, its flocks of sheep munching the grasslands, the monks acting both as employers and exploiters. And, of course, the monastery was the center of culture; in the museum, fragments of medieval tiles, ornate and delicate, and the great sculptural bosses from the roof of the abbey give a potent taste of the splendors of the place at the height of its prosperity.Just across the road is the little parish church, with some of the most evocative medieval wall paintings I know, even in an area rich with these reminders that once all churches were blazoned with pattern and story. At Hailes there are two sto-ries - on one wall is St. Christopher, patron saint of (Continued on Page 94) travelers, here a shadowy figure with a staff making his way across a river; opposite is a rare secular painting of a hare crouching under a tree, ears laid back in fear, facing two panting greyhounds. Elsewhere are patchy fragments of fleurs-de-lis and in one corner is a grotesque owl creature straight out of Hieronymus Bosch.I can remember, as a schoolgirl, trailing around in the wake of my grandmother and my aunt, knowledgeable church buffs, while they reveled in clerestories and misericords. All I wanted to do was get home for tea. I can't remember now when I saw the light and learned to savor the pleasures of church-crawling for myself - but there is no better place in which to do it than this hinge of Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire. Arm yourself with the appropriate volume of Nikolaus Pevsner's ''Buildings of England,'' or one of the several competent guides to parish churches, and you will soon become immersed in distinguishing Perpendicular from Decorated, searching for medieval brasses and arrestingly phrased wall memorials, wandering through cow parsley and meadowsweet in the churchyard to read the gravestones. An afternoon of this is infinitely more satisfying than the routine visit to some scheduled place of interest - you feel a proper sense of discovery, a pride of possession.That being said, there are a couple of well-visited places that should not be missed. Sudeley Castle, just outside Winchcombe, is a Tudor pile once fallen into ruin and replenished in the 19th century by an indomitable wealthy collector called Mrs. Enna Dent, who pieced the place together again and furnished it with an eclectic lot of stuff, much of which is there now, including some fine paintings - a Turner and a Constable, a Van Dyck and a Jan Steen. Outside, there are yowling peacocks, hedges of yew and box clipped to within an inch of their lives and manicured gravel paths. All a bit too neat and tidy, to my eye, but the arthritic old oaks in the parkland are a compensation. Indeed, Sudeley is perhaps a good example of what goes right and wrong with the professional stately home trying to keep its end up in the marketplace of tourism today. Display and information are well done, but the spit and polish is carried too far and somehow drains the place of much feeling of reality. And, of course, there is the ubiquitous shop. Plus a craft center - another essential ingredient these days, it seems - in which decently crafted goods are distressingly mixed up with some dreadful kitsch. S NOWS HILL MANOR, A few miles away in the village of Snowshill, is more to my taste. The house itself is a traditional Cots-wold manor house - sprawling, architecturally incoherent, stiff with beams and mullioned windows and paneling and unexpected little rooms and staircases. The gardens are a delight - sunny walled terraces leading one from another, sweeps of lawn and great brooding trees. But the function of the place today is as a shrine to British eccentricity. We are rather good at eccentrics, and Charles Wade, who owned Snowshill from 1919 till his death in 1956, was a champion among them. He was a collector. Not one of your deliberate, organized, fastidious collectors, but a wonderful crazy jackdaw collector - accumulating everything and anything from lace bobbin winders and Bath chairs to suits of Japanese samurai armor.There it all is, this glorious jumble of acquisition, crammed into the many rooms of the manor, without much attempt at rhyme or reason; and, indeed, you would be hard put to impose order on an accumulation that has little or no binding theme other than a vague predilection for the Oriental.Charles Wade's taste in furniture was simple: if it is veneered, gilt-encrusted, has drawers, miniature porticoes, pillars with ornate capitals, inlay of any kind - buy it. Furniture as architecture - ''Chinese cabinet of black and gold lacquer in the form of a Buddhist shrine; large cabinet with brass inlay and semiprecious stones; Spanish Vargueno cabinet . . . ,'' the guidebook gives up in despair. And there are the 15 spinning wheels and the 28 leather fire buckets and the dozens of enormous keys displayed in a glass case and the Admiral Room with its ships and globes and instruments of navigation. There is also a room with nothing but old musical instruments, from hurdy-gurdies to an 18th-century cello and an ophicleide and three citterns.From time to time Charles Wade seems to have run amok completely - 11 German Black Forest clocks, for heaven's sake, and what must be the prototype of a baby bouncer (heavily worn) and the most ancient baby strollers I've ever seen. Up in the attic is a cavalcade of antique bicycles, with a hefty penny-farthing triumphantly presiding. There are models of haywagons, a couple of feet long with shaft, and each of them different, crafted replicas of the various kinds used in English counties -Wiltshire, Hampshire, Oxfordshire, Sussex . . .

4286	 1994	a	It may be as late as game time tomorrow night against the Devils before we find out the fate of the Rangers. Unless the National Hockey League's Owners' Assembly votes to allow the Rangers to trade Adam Graves and Brian Leetch for Wayne Gretzky, we might as well kiss the Cup goodbye.Call this the longest day. One can only imagine the promises and payoffs flying around like loose pucks. On one side is the so-called Ice-Agers, the traditional old guard of Canadian-oriented owners, led by Toronto and Montreal, who believe that a championship in New York will anchor the league against the rising tide of parvenu glitz-kriegers who want to turn it into a white N.B.A.On the other side is the so-called Seven Dwarfs, the progressive new franchises who want to make the N.H.L. a truly modern major league. The Dwarfs are led by the Disney Mighty Ducks and the Blockbuster Panthers. They are politicking for the votes of the so-called Snowblowers, who have so far stayed out of the fray -- like hockey players who spray ice when they brake sharply at the first sign of trouble.To permit this extraordinary trade after the league's regular deadline requires a two-thirds vote by the Assembly, a semisecret group that meets only in special session and then only on issues that affect the survival of the sport.

1613	 2010	a	Townies is a series about life in New York, and occasionally other cities.In Hong Kong, where I lived until I was 14, most expat kids had more than one passport; spoke English, Cantonese (curse words were the gateway) and at least one romance language; and we could emulate several accents convincingly. We were well-designed for espionage.So, when my father moved us from a skyscraper near the horse racing track in Hong Kong to a red brick house in San Antonio, I already had a taupe American cadence prepared that I’d borrowed from “Kate and Allie” reruns and a Virginia-born boyfriend. By the time Britain returned Hong Kong to China — three years after I’d left and 156 years after they’d taken it over — I had also acquired, when the occasion demanded it, a quiver of y’alls.In suburban Texas, I switched on the television to watch the stringently polite ceremony called “the handover.” I was a half hour from fleeing the experimental independence of a one-bedroom apartment I paid $75 a month to share with five high school classmates, and heading back to my parents air-conditioned house 15 blocks away. My roommates nattered on about the soldiers’ trim, yarn-dyed outfits, boots and matching hats that did, admittedly, make the whole thing look like the reenactment of a battle between warring tribes of chauffeurs. Flags were solemnly lowered and folded, fireworks were shot into the air and 6.3 million people suddenly found themselves standing in a special administrative region instead of a crown colony.I felt like my insides had been scooped out. But I mentally cauterized the dry socket behind my sternum, finished cramming tangled clothes and small appliances into my Honda Civic, waved, shut the car door and drove off.Manhattan still reminds me of Hong Kong. And it’s not just the disparate population, spellbinding skyline and internationally recognized address.I’m great at leaving. I am less talented at getting left though I should be better given how much it’s happened. Hong Kong was a train station set to techno and social circles depended on the location of your father’s employ. You could never rely on having the same friends year in and out. You never knew when your own number was going to get called. How expats process upheaval is where we differ from immigrants. There is a tacit understanding among us that maudlin goodbyes are indulgent and uncalled for.Hong Kong had a wildly diverse population of expatriates saying their unsentimental farewells. There were enough British, French, Germans and Americans that they all had their own primary and secondary schools. (I attended the English system with Korean school on Saturdays.) But the schools were not as balkanized as you’d expect. Not with such an efficient, latchkey-kid-friendly public transportation system. Not when the legal drinking age of 18 was more suggestion than law and most of us, by age 10 or 11, had experimented with inexpensive, caustic rice wine mixed with sugary juice drink. Not when whole nightclubs were dominated by 13-year-olds trying to befriend 16-year-olds from across town. A successful night was judged by how many upperclassmen greeted you or hated your guts the following Monday. Both responses were regarded positively.We were emboldened by props that are only viewed as grown-up by children, like Marlboro 100’s and near-neon, triple-shot tequila sunrises in skinny glasses with black straws. We also had a thing for four-star hotel restaurants and were rarely booted from dining rooms despite brazenly filching canapés and plucking medium-rare medallions from lavish buffets with panoramic backdrops. To better blend in while filling our bellies, we’d frequently strike up conversations with lone international travelers. Like an anthropologist, I enjoyed hoarding the stories and idioms of these exotic strangers, and the memories of their shoes.Now in New York, when people skip states, disappear into marriages and young families, or simply get pruned along the way, it can be difficult for me to feel anything beyond a distracted curiosity. Maybe the detachment is useful. Perhaps it only seems like a bad thing. Like holding the single allele of sickle-cell anemia that ends up heightening a resistance to malaria. All I know is that a force field makes navigation in a frenetic New York easier. As does the ability to cold read anyone you meet along the way, then shape-shift your accent, cadence, syntax and semantics to best suit them.Jungyeon RohManhattan, after eight years here, still reminds me of Hong Kong. There are parts of Chinatown that are the spit and image of streets in Wan Chai and I am held in thrall by the Chrysler building as much as I was by I.M. Pei’s Bank of China Tower. But in the consolation facsimile I had first sought for superficial reasons — the dense, disparate population, spellbinding skyline, internationally recognized address — I hadn’t considered the implication of the city’s pace or the composition of its inhabitants. I fit in. It’s not just that the ingrained muscle memory for social navigation and a hearty tolerance for alcohol acquired in Hong Kong turned out to be felicitous traits in New York. It’s that here sometimes I get to sound like myself.At a friend’s recent dinner party, I met a British man who was born in Hong Kong and now lives in the West Village. He is the publisher and editor of a hardcover travel and food magazine and I immediately recognized the ease, the voracity, with which he navigated Asia and Europe as something familiar, that special expat birthright. We knew many of the same people both here and in Hong Kong but had somehow always missed one other. We exasperated our host and alienated other guests by competitively peppering each other with Cantonese slang from the early ’90s. With him, I did not modulate the corners of my consonants. Words clattered out at a clip that could not be checked for quality or calculation.In New York, I find I am less watchful, less greedy, less restless. Besides, I have finally acquired a handful of friends that I do not hold at arm’s length to analyze. And with them, I do not secrete every meaningful thought away in the apothecary drawers in my brain. They ask me questions and I respond with answers, not decoys or digressions. With them, too, especially when I’m angry or excited, my language is unguarded. I am suddenly “chuffed” instead of proud, “skint” in place of broke, eat “crisps” and an “aiyah” may make an appearance to indicate alarm. They rib me about my guilelessly disclosed peripatetic hodgepodge, my squirmy diphthongs and strange argot. But I am grateful that they get through my force field. I even tell them so.Mary H.K.

168	 2018	a	WASHINGTON — President Trump’s calls this week for more vocational schools have received a lukewarm reception from the higher education community, including from the educators who teach in the programs he is championing.The president first raised expanding vocational education in his State of the Union address on Tuesday — the only nod to education policy in the speech — as a work force development strategy. On Thursday, Mr. Trump expounded on the proposal, asserting that efforts to teach students trades had diminished since he attended an elite military boarding school, where he said he had a classmate who wasn’t the “greatest student” but “was able to fix a car engine blindfolded.”“He had a different kind of a talent, and we should have vocational schools,” Mr. Trump said during a speech at a Republican congressional retreat in West Virginia. “You learn mechanical, you learn bricklaying and carpentry and all of these things. We don’t have that very much anymore. And I think the word ‘vocational’ is a much better word than in many cases, a community college. A lot of people don’t know what a community college means or represents.”Policy experts and organizations that advocate the trade programs — which for more than a decade have been recognized as career and technical education, or C.T.E. — took issue with the president’s antiquated characterization of a sector of higher education that has expanded beyond laborers who are not cut out for academia.

2592	 2004	a	Robert Moses, the master builder who uprooted many tenants in his day, said you couldn't make an omelet without breaking some eggs.He failed to mention wedges, woods, putters, irons and drivers.The latest project unveiled for Lower Manhattan, the Fulton Street Transit Center, will connect four subway stations under a crystalline glass dome. It will also almost surely doom the World of Golf in its building at 189 Broadway.Overflowing with golf balls, apparel and hundreds of gleaming clubs, the second-floor store opened in 1998 but had to close for six months after being badly damaged in the Sept. 11, 2001, attack.''I'm extremely concerned that this will represent the second death of this business,'' said David Braham, 48, an owner of the World of Golf, whose other store, at 147 East 47th Street, was opened by his parents, Stanley and Anne, in 1968.

7535	 1964	a	The New York Knicks will attempt tonight at Madison Square Garden .to gain their first victory of the season over the Boston Celtics.

1997	 2007	a	Congressional travel arrangements and Democratic presidential candidates both old and new played large roles on the blogs today.Al Gore was nominated for a Nobel Peace Price for his efforts in global climate change, efforts that also have him in position to possibly win an Academy Award for his documentary “An Inconvenient Truth.” And some blogs saw these potential awards as a possible prelude to a victory of a bigger kind.The left-leaning Daily Kos considered the possibility of the world’s first Nobel Prize winning, Oscar holding, President of the United States.“So say Gore scores an Oscar and Nobel in the same year, he can announce in November and still become THE story in the primaries. It’s not as if he’ll need the full year to get his name recognition up or make the case for his candidacy … His passion is fighting global warming, not Social Security solvency or extracting ourselves from Bush’s myriad messes. But if the stars align properly, you never know.”MyDD thought Gore might be taking too much time to leap into the presidential race.The winner of the Nobel Prize “is traditionally announced in mid-October… then he can announce for President the following week? Seriously, how much time does Al Gore need to have for announcing a presidential campaign?”The blogs also focused on Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, who kicked off his run for the nomination yesterday with some widely criticized “compliments” for Senator Barack Obama of Illinois.Patrick Ruffini, writing on his self-titled blog, (even though he’s been hired on by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s nascent 2008 campaign, took another angle on the comments from the charges of insensitivity and potential racism of yesterday.Why, the site wondered, would a politician be so effusive in praise of his competition,“Exciting. Fresh. Smart. New. Insightful. Lightning in a jar. Six ways of saying the same thing. Excuse me Senator, but if Barack Obama is all these things, why don’t you get out of the race and endorse him now?”And Nancy Pelosi, who the conservative blogs covered with copious doomsday posts when she became Speaker of the House, found herself under conservative criticism yet again, this time for her travel arrangements.Responding to reports in the Washington Times that she is “pressing the Bush administration for routine access to military aircraft for domestic flights,” Suitably Flip said“Nancy Pelosi is so bounteous with her new-found spoils that not only will she treat herself to military aircraft for all her travel needs, but so too shall her family members, her staff – heck, even fellow Congress members (so long as they hail from California) avail themselves of the on-demand military commuting service.”Captain’s Quarters Blog, while acknowledging that J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the previous Speaker, sometimes used military transport for security reasons, said that Ms. Pelosi’s “request goes far beyond even that questionable consideration … the military is not a charter service for politicians who want to avoid using the same airports as the rest of the hoi polloi. The military has other responsibilities, especially in a time of war, and pampering Congressmen shouldn’t take precedence over them.”

2479	 2005	a	"It's a mystery to those of us -- hard to understand, almost to the point of amusement -- how she does it without any clear sign of what led her to that path," he continued. "She gives no sign of why she thinks what she thinks."They began by drawing pictures and making crude estimates over ice cream and coffee in that ice cream parlor, which is now a taqueria. What they drew pictures of was a kind of Oreo cookie multiverse, an architecture similar to one first discovered as a solution of the string equations by Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study and Petr Horava, now at Berkeley. Dr. Randall and Dr. Sundrum's model consisted of a pair of universes, four-dimensional branes, thinly separated by a five-dimensional space poetically called the bulk.When they solved the equations for this setup, they discovered that the space between the branes would be warped. Objects, for example, would appear to grow larger or smaller and get less massive or more massive as they moved back and forth between the branes.Such a situation, they realized to their surprise, could provide a natural explanation for the hierarchy problem without invoking supersymmetry. Suppose, they said, that gravity is actually inherently as strong as the other forces, but because of the warping gravity is much much stronger on one of the branes than on the other one, where we happen to live. So we experience gravity as extremely weak."You can be only a modest distance away from the gravity brane," Dr. Randall said, "and gravity will be incredibly weak." A result was a natural explanation for why atomic forces outgun gravity by 10 million billion to 1. Could this miracle be true? Crazy as it sounded, they soon discovered an even more bizarre possibility. The fifth dimension could actually be infinite and we would not have noticed it.In this case, there would be only one brane, ours, containing both gravity as we know it and the rest of nature. But it would warp space in the same way as in the first model, trapping gravity nearby so that we would experience space-time as four-dimensional. This new single brane model did not solve the weak gravity problem, Dr. Randall admitted, but it was a revelation, that an infinite ocean of space could be sitting next to us undetected."So when we wrote this paper, what we were concentrating on was this amazing fact that really had been overlooked for 100 years -- well, years, whatever -- that you can have this infinite extra dimension," she said. "I mean it was quite wild."

5332	 1988	a	The personnel shake-up in the Soviet Communist Party yesterday was accompanied by a revamping of the party structure. Six Central Committee commissions were created, all headed by secretaries of the Central Committee, to supplant 22 departments as the party's main administrative apparatus. Political power continues to be centered in the Central Committee and the Politburo, where all important decisions are made. Communist Party CongressTheoretically the highest body, the congress consists of delegates elected by party organizations around the country. It ordinarily convenes at least once every five years, with its next meeting scheduled in 1991. The Congress elects the Central Committee, which is to meet at least every six months. Central CommitteeConsisting of about 300 voting and 150 nonvoting members, it is picked from among party congress delegates. It acts for the congress between sessions, meeting about twice a year to discuss and approve policies. It formally elects what is, in effect, the highest party body, the Politburo. PolitburoIt sets the overall policy of the country and now has 12 full (voting) members and 8 candidate (nonvoting) members, all of whom are among the nation's leading political figures. All members have regular duties elsewhere in the party or Government. Secretariat

7483	 1964	a	BERLIN, July 31 — Premier Khrushchev may be ready to offer a slight modification of the Soviet stand on Berlin as a goodwill gesture to pave the way for a meeting with Chancellor Ludwig Erhard of West Germany, informed sources said today.The move would involve acceptance by the Soviet Union of the inclusion of West Berlin in a new trade agreement between West Germany and the Soviet Union. This would amount to a tacit recognition of Bonn's formal economic ties with West Berlin.The sources recalled, however, that the Soviet leader was reported to have reassured Welter Ulbricht, Communist chief of East Germany, in Warsaw last week that the Soviet Union did not contemplate any other changes on Germany and the country's reunification.Above all, Mr. Khrushchev was said to have stressed his determination to maintain the Russian stand of two separate Germanys that must come to terms with each other in direct negotiations. The West has repeatedly rejected such suggestions as unworkable.
3053	 2001	a	Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is an astonishing work. But it's easy to forget that, since so many performances are overlaid with political symbolism. For generations, Beethoven's Ninth has been conscripted into service by conductors eager to make grand statements of affirmation: for United Nations Day, to commemorate the Allied victory or to celebrate the tearing down of the Berlin Wall or such.But Kurt Masur has an infectious belief in the meaning of such gestures and in the message of this choral symphony, with its unabashed call for brotherhood and joy. He also just happens to know a lot about conducting Beethoven. So for the last two years the New York Philharmonic's New Year's Eve performances of Beethoven's Ninth drew packed houses to Avery Fisher Hall.The hall was sold out again for this New Year's Eve concert, but, since the orchestra never plays on Sundays, the performance took place on Saturday. The blizzard that hit the region just added to the sense of occasion. Naturally, many patrons called in to return their tickets. But plenty of determined Beethoven lovers showed up before the concert to take their places.It felt good to be part of this hardy audience. If only the Philharmonic could attract this many young people to its subscription concerts. And Mr. Masur assembled a wonderfully diverse roster of performers.

6225	 1973	a	The number of civilian complaints filed against New York City policemen during 1972 has reached a record 3,700, or triple the figure of five years ago.At the same time, however, the proportion of such complaints leading to a recommendation of formal Police Department charges against the policemen involved is just 2.5 per cent, a new low.Over the years most complaints have alleged “unnecessary force.” Other complaints charge abuse of authority, discourtesy and ethnic slurs.Sterling Johnson Jr., executive director of the Police Department's Civilian Complaint Review Board, which processes the complaints, says that the increase in complaints reflects the public's confidence in the board's impartiality.

3699	 1998	a	SHEPPS-HOWARD. WE WERE TOGETHER WHEN YOU WERE BORN...WE WERE TOGETHER WHEN YOU DIED... WE WISH YOU WERE HERE.
4720	 1991	a	When Peruvian guerrillas take one of Tess's colleagues hostage, young Melody Shepherd arrives in Washington from a small affiliate station. Melody says she is the hostage's niece. Although someone mentions that the captured man never said, over some 20 years, anything about having a niece, good old Tess takes the novice under her wing, even inviting her home until she can find an apartment. Melody's working technique is disarmingly simple: "A bit of promise. A lot of suggestion."It takes the usually astute Tess an incredibly long time to figure out what's going on, but she begins to get the picture as Melody seduces not only her son, Andrew (David James Elliott), but also her New York boss, Brad (Jed Allen), who decides -- shades of a certain morning news show -- that early viewers might appreciate a younger woman, all blond and perky, while getting ready for work. Finally, Tess catches Melody going through her personal computer files. That's it."We may be working on the same story," Tess says, "but my work is my work, and your work is whatever I tell you to do."Melody is anything but subtle. Surveying Washington at night she gushes about "the sheer power of this town: like an aphrodisiac" (the movie's original title was "Potomac Fever"). Meanwhile, Tess has been having, mostly by long distance, an intense affair with Peter (Stuart Wilson), an English foreign correspondent who wants her to give up everything and run off with him to Spain. This leads to endless discussions on the nature of love. She: "But I love you." He: "And I love you. Therein lies the tragedy." (Presumably, the British can get away with lines like that.)And in the end "Her Wicked Ways" is thoroughly dishonest, preoccupied only with giving the mass audience what it supposedly craves -- an upbeat ending. Bette Davis may have allowed herself to be bested by the unstoppable Eve, but this is the world of television stars and Barbara Eden is not about to take second place to any Melody Shepherd. Tess gets not just her revenge but also the anchor job and Peter who, in case you missed the point, says, "Your life is damn near perfect, isn't it?"

1220	 2012	a	As of Monday’s FiveThirtyEight forecast, there were 21 states that Barack Obama was projected to have at least an 85 percent chance of winning on Nov. 6. The list includes three important states, Ohio, Wisconsin and New Hampshire, where Mr. Obama’s polling has improved by an especially clear margin since the Democratic convention. It did not include several others, however, where he is favored, but less definitively so, such as Virginia, Iowa, Nevada, Colorado and Florida.If Mr. Obama’s overall standing holds in its current position, he should have no trouble winning some of those states, perhaps along with others like North Carolina. But suppose there is a deterioration in his polls between now and Nov. 6 — or that the polls have overestimated his standing across the board. And so Mr. Obama wins the states where he has at least an 85 percent chance of victory in the forecast, but no others. Then we’d be left with the following map:If you add up the electoral votes in that case, they come out to Obama 269, Romney 269: an exact Electoral College tie. The election would then be thrown to the House of Representatives, which would cast votes based on the provisions of the 12th Amendment.Mitt Romney would probably win such an election, because Republicans will probably control a majority of state delegations in the incoming House of Representatives. (The forecast model draws lots and awards the election to Mr. Romney 80 percent of the time in such cases.)But it would surely come with tremendous controversy, especially if the 269-269 tie came in an election in which Mr. Obama had won the popular vote.Fortunately, such an outcome remains quite unlikely. Of the 25,001 simulations that we ran on Monday, a 269-269 tie came up in 152 model runs, or about 0.6 percent of the time.Still, this probability has roughly doubled from a few weeks ago, when the chances had been hovering at about 0.3 percent instead.Most of these tied simulations, 137 of 152, reflected the exact map that I described above — with Mr. Obama winning Ohio, Wisconsin and New Hampshire but losing the other highly competitive states. An especially good poll for Mr. Obama in New Hampshire on Monday accounted for some of the increase in this possibility, since New Hampshire now looks like a more likely win for him than other states like Iowa and Nevada, whose 6 electoral votes would be enough to clinch an outright win for Mr. Obama when New Hampshire’s 4 would not.The next-most-common tie outcome came up just 5 times, but it is an interesting map. It begins with a rather common 270-268 winning scenario for Mr. Obama, in which he winds up losing Ohio, but salvages the election by winning Nevada and Virginia. (This is probably Mr. Obama’s path of least resistance if something goes wrong for him in Ohio.)However, in these five simulations, Mr. Obama also lost the Second Congressional District in Maine — one of two states, along with Nebraska, that awards some of its electoral votes by Congressional District. Polls have shown Mr. Obama running well ahead of Mr. Romney in Maine statewide — but they have also had Mr. Romney within the single digits in the Second District, which is relatively poor and quite rural. Mr. Romney is very unlikely to win the Second District in the status quo, but if there is a swing back toward him nationally, it could be competitive. And if he won it, Mr. Obama’s victory would be transformed into 269-269 tie instead.Only two other 269-269 tie scenarios came up more than once in the simulations. The case below is geographically coherent: Mr. Obama under-performs in the Midwest, losing Ohio, Wisconsin, and Iowa, but he wins the three swing states in the Western United States (New Mexico, Colorado and Nevada), along with wealthy New Hampshire and Virginia. Still, this outcome has become unlikely, given Mr. Obama’s polling strength recently in Ohio and Wisconsin.A variation on this theme would have Mr. Obama winning Wisconsin, which has 10 electoral votes, but losing both New Hampshire and Nevada, which together have 10.Five other tied maps came up exactly once in the simulations, and are presented mostly for amusement’s sake. They involve various implausible but not impossible combinations, such as Mr. Obama winning Wisconsin but losing Minnesota.What is Mr. Obama’s defense against this? The wild card is if Mr. Obama won the Second Congressional District in Nebraska, as he did in 2008 and where polls have shown a competitive race. However, he is unlikely to do so if his standing declines nationally, as these 269-269 ties would require. So Mr. Obama will simply have to make sure that he targets 270 electoral votes rather than 269. Mr. Romney, conversely, who has his hands full in the swing states right now, might as well treat these tied maps as winning ones.

7425	 1964	a	BOSTON, March 31—Francis Cardinal König, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Vienna, defended Pope Pius XII today for “doing what he thought was best at the moment,” during Hitler's massacre of the Jews in World War II.Cardinal König made his observations during a news conference at the Paulist Fathers Roman Catholic Information Center after he was asked to comment on Rolf Hochhuth's play, “The Deputy.”The play accuses Pius of failing to speak out strongly against the mass murders.Cardinal König said, “It is easier to talk about what should have been done 20 years later, when you have more information at hand.” He asserted that the play “grossly misrepresented” the role of the church during the World War II era.The Austrian prelate arrived here last night as the guest of the Paulist Fathers and of Richard Cardinal Cushing of Boston. He will open a threeweek lecture tour tomorrow night.

1200	 2012	a	PhotoDonald Trump, the archvillain of Anthony Baxter’s documentary polemic, “You’ve Been Trumped,” is a man many people love to hate. In this unabashedly hostile portrait of a billionaire developer in action as he embarks on a grandiose new project in Scotland, Mr. Trump comes across as an insensitive, lying bully who will do whatever it takes to realize his dream of creating what he promises will be the world’s greatest golf resort.The $1.5 billion project involves building two 18-hole golf courses (the first one opened last month), a 450-bedroom luxury hotel, and a complex of apartments and golf villas on the North Sea coast. Environmental protection was pushed aside for economic development, and the government supported the project, which Mr. Trump declared would bring 6,000 jobs to the area.Like Michael Moore in “Roger and Me,” Mr. Baxter is a persistent gnat who hovers around Mr. Trump and his entourage, camera in hand, and refuses to be brushed off. At one point in the film he is arrested and charged with breach of the peace. But whereas Mr. Moore was the star of his own film, Mr. Baxter, who was born in eastern Scotland not far from the development area, maintains a low profile in a documentary that has no narrator.PhotoThere is also a big difference between Roger Smith, the General Motors chief executive officer whom Mr. Moore was never able to interview in his film, and the publicity-loving Mr. Trump, who broadcast his ambitions on late-night television and on the Golf Channel. “You’ve Been Trumped” lards in excerpts from Bill Forsyth’s 1983 fillm, “Local Hero,” in which a Texas oil baron wants to build a refinery in a fictional Scottish coastal town.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyOnce construction begins on the 1,400-acre Menie Estate, which Mr. Trump bought in 2005, the lives of the farmers and fishermen in nearby Balmedie, a town of 3,000, are disrupted.
4444	 1993	a	What is still baffling the investigators trying to determine whether terrorists were behind the World Trade Center bombing is the effective silence that has followed it.Since attention is a main goal of terrorism, the people responsible for such acts usually find a way to make it clear that they were the ones who carried them out. But in the aftermath of the bombing on Friday at the World Trade Center, none of the more than 50 callers who have claimed responsibility have presented convincing proof."What has appeared to be lacking is a definitive claim of responsibility in which a group demonstrates that they were the ones who committed the act," said a senior Federal official involved in the investigation. Earmarks of TerrorismYet at the same time, Federal officials and private experts said, the explosion bore many of the earmarks of a terrorist attack, including the size of the explosion and the choice of a symbolic target.

4557	 1992	a	While living in Greenwich Village and Harlem, Wright produced hundreds of articles and short stories. Working for the Federal Writers Project, he wrote the Harlem section for New York Panorama and contributed to "The Harlems" in the New York City Guide. His friends in the arts included Ralph Ellison (future author of "Invisible Man" and best man at Wright's wedding), Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, Nelson Algren, John Hammond, Carson McCullers and John Steinbeck. The turning point in his career came in 1940 when Harper and Brothers published "Native Son," with its memorable violent character, Bigger Thomas. It was a main selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club and sold 215,000 copies in three weeks.Because of Wright's lectures and writings against racism, the F.B.I. investigated him in 1942 to determine if he could be prosecuted for sedition. Professor Rampersad notes that Wright continued to be monitored by the F.B.I., and later by the C.I.A. as well, for the rest of his life. His autobiography, "Black Boy," was denounced as obscene on the floor of the Senate in 1945 by Senator Theodore Bilbo, a Mississippi Democrat. The book sold 195,000 copies in its Harper edition and 351,000 through the Book-of-the-Month Club. Living in France after World War II, Wright came under the influence of the existentialists. His novel "The Outsider" appeared in 1953, but existentialism was not his forte.The reader of Professor Rampersad's notes on the text learns that the Book-of-the-Month Club requested changes in both of Wright's major works to cool down some of the sexual passages and to eliminate his political experiences. Wright wrote in his journal that pressure from American Communists led the book club to ask him to drop the second section of his autobiography, which dealt with his involvement with the party in Chicago. The challenging title "American Hunger" was changed to "Black Boy."Wright acceded to the changes and made them himself -- understandably, since the book club meant recognition and improved his fortunes. For black as well as white writers -- in newspapers, magazines, books and films -- freedom of language and subjects were nowhere near the same in the 1940's as they are in the 1990's. But even with the cuts, "Native Son" was still strong medicine for white readers. It became politically correct (in today's phrase) to read it or see it performed onstage.Now all the self-censored material has been restored in both volumes of "Richard Wright." For the first time, the complete text of Wright's autobiography has been brought together, using the page proofs that were set before the book club's intervention. Similarly, Wright's first novel, "Lawd Today!," is reinstated with its kaleidoscopic experiments restored. Present-day readers will be pleasantly surprised by its stylistic passages that recall parts of John Dos Passos' "U.S.A."

72	 2019	a	Update: June 1, 2019This article has been updated to reflect estimates of satellites potentially appearing in images taken by a telescope that were revised after it was published.Last month, SpaceX successfully launched 60 500-pound satellites into space. Soon amateur skywatchers started sharing images of those satellites in night skies, igniting an uproar among astronomers who fear that the planned orbiting cluster will wreak havoc on scientific research and trash our view of the cosmos.The main issue is that those 60 satellites are merely a drop in the bucket. SpaceX anticipates launching thousands of satellites — creating a mega-constellation of false stars collectively called Starlink that will connect the entire planet to the internet, and introduce a new line of business for the private spaceflight company.While astronomers agree that global internet service is a worthy goal, the satellites are bright — too bright.“This has the potential to change what a natural sky looks like,” said Tyler Nordgren, an astronomer who is now working full-time to promote night skies.
2616	 2004	a	Preachers, politicians, creditors and divorce lawyers have spent the last few weeks jabbing more at Mike Tyson than Danny Williams, who knocked out Tyson in the fourth round Friday night. All have decried Tyson's bankruptcies, both financial and personal. And, for many critics, Tyson's need to stage several multimillion-dollar fights just to pay his creditors signifies boxing's overall decline.But the short-story writer and former boxer Thom Jones, author of ''Sonny Liston Was a Friend of Mine,'' says he thinks that Tyson craves his return to the ring for more than financial reasons, and that the sport of boxing will meet the bell despite its current struggles.''Mike is basically a showman, a smart guy, and a lot smarter than most people think,'' Jones said. ''His crimes are no worse than many football and basketball players'. The ring for him now is a refuge from all the people who want a piece of him. His real mistake has been believing what his entourage has told him. Don King took a dollar for every 50 cents he gave Mike.''Don King is the symbol of what is wrong with boxing, not Mike Tyson. Without King, Mike Tyson might have led the renaissance of boxing like we thought he would when he first won the crown.''

2035	 2007	a	If you’re a political junkie with Internet access looking for cheap laughs — and if you’re reading this column, you probably are — take a minute, go to YouTube and search for “Nixon” and “Rove.”Your query will yield a 1972 CBS news segment on Richard M. Nixon’s reelection campaign. At the four-minute mark — not long after a passing mention of “an electric paper-shredding machine, to destroy secret campaign documents,” located “just out of sight” at Nixon headquarters — we meet the soft-cheeked, thick-sideburned 21-year-old Rove. Already the director of the College Republicans, Rove speaks with evident polish, touting the campaign’s youth outreach effort.However amusing the interview with Rove (done by Dan Rather), the operative’s role in Nixon’s 1972 organization — the one that brought us Watergate — is more than a curiosity. Rove has recently found himself in legal peril again, this time alleged to have sought to politicize the non-partisan General Services Administration, along with scrutiny for his part in the firings of eight United States attorneys. The reminder of his roots in Nixon’s anything-to-win political machine is telling.When George W. Bush became president, the smart money pegged him as Ronald Reagan redux. Bill Keller, now the executive editor of The New York Times, persuasively laid out the case in a nearly 8,000-word piece for the Sunday Magazine titled “Reagan’s Son.” The two men, he pointed out, had similar political agendas in cutting social services and taxes on the rich and projecting American military power abroad. They also shared a management style, establishing their administrations’ big picture while delegating details.In his ideology and his policies, Bush’s debt to Reagan has been borne out. (Conservative purists back in the day even accused Reagan, as they do Bush now, of betraying their principles when he became unpopular.) In other ways, however — Bush’s political style, his attitudes toward executive power, and his contempt for democratic procedures — it has been clear for many years now that his real role model is Nixon.The resemblances could fill a magazine article as long as Keller’s. Both Bush and Nixon, resentful of the supposed cultural dominance of liberals, perfected a conservative populism that vilifies academics, journalists, bureaucrats and other professionals as out-of-touch elites. Both men, hostile to the news media, rigidly prescribed the messages that their staffers could take to the press. Both vaunted secrecy, restricted access to information, and politicized areas of the government once deemed the province of non-partisan experts.Iraq has generated even more echoes of the Nixon years. In a book review in The New York Times recently, Michiko Kakutani said it was hard to read Robert Dallek’s new tome, “Nixon and Kissinger” without regarding it “as a kind of parable about the presidency of George W. Bush and its determination to stay the course in Iraq.” Regardless of whether you agree that Iraq resembles Vietnam, Bush has certainly used the pretext of being a “war president” to justify curtailing civil liberties, expanding presidential power, and demonizing dissenters — as Nixon had. Claiming national security threats without furnishing the evidence to prove their claims, both men also illegally wiretapped Americans.Interesting as the parallels are, however, the Nixon presidency matters to the Bush presidency less as an analogue than as history. Nixon’s was not simply a species of presidency similar to Bush’s but was the soil from which the Bush presidency grew. Rove’s dirty tricks matter, in other words, because they establish a direct lineage between the anything-goes mentality of the Nixon White House and the hardball of the Bush administration.It’s been widely reported, for example, that Rove’s mentors in the College Republicans during the Nixon years included dirty-tricks maestros Lee Atwater and Donald Segretti. Newspapers have also reported that in 1970 Rove sneaked into the campaign headquarters of a Democratic candidate for state office in Illinois, filched campaign letterhead, and sent out fake fliers aiming to discredit the Democrat. In my own research on Nixon, I discovered that during Watergate itself, Rove used a phony grassroots organization to try to rally Americans to the president’s defense against what he called “the lynch-mob atmosphere created” by “the Nixon-hating media.” And according to Nixon’s former counsel John Dean, the Watergate prosecutor’s office took an interest in Rove’s underhanded activities before deciding “they had bigger fish to fry.”Rove, moreover, is hardly the only link in the chain. Indeed, his youth outreach effort of 1972 had some success. A whole generation of conservative activists came of age in the 1970s either working for Nixon or, more commonly, voluntarily defending him on campuses and in political circles. His shame was their outrage.These young conservative activists essentially endorsed the line that Nixon put out during Watergate— that “everybody does it.” They agreed that the president had to resign only because a double standard prevailed in the media and in Washington. Nixon’s dirty tricks, his efforts to politicize the civil service and discredit the media, and his willingness to use executive power for personal and political gain were really no cause for indignation. They were politics as usual.“Frost/Nixon,” a new play about Nixon’s 1977 interviews with the British talk-show host David Frost, recently came to Broadway. Appropriately enough, it stars the former Dracula, Frank Langella, as Nixon. In the drama, as in the real-life interviews with Frost, Nixon’s most memorable line came when he said: “When the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.” Audiences roar at the comment. But they do so, I fear, only because they are hearing it spoken by a delightfully hammy Langella amid the opulence of a Broadway theater.

5199	 1988	a	Kindred on Saxophone Bob Kindred Quartet, at Red Blazer Too, 349 West 46th Street (262-3112). The spirit of the great tenor-saxophonist Ben Webster is kept alive in the playing of Bob Kindred, who frequently shows his deep admiration for Webster not by copying him but by building on the emotion and intelligence that Webster brought to his performances. Soul and swing are two dominant elements in Mr. Kindred's work, but there is also a strong overlay of simple basic fun. He has been playing on Sunday afternoons at the Red Blazer Too since last fall, using a small interchangeable company of associates. This Sunday, when the group plays from 1 to 5 P.M., Al Harewood will be the drummer, Ted Rosenthal will be the pianist, and John Goldsby will be on bass. There is no cover charge and no minimum. Brunches range from $9.95 to $13.95. Braff, Moore and AldenRuby Braff Trio, at Zinno, 126 West 13th Street (924-5182). Ruby Braff, the dauntless little cornetist, has such a confident personal style that he contributes an individual glow to any group he's in. With Michael Moore as his bassist, as frequently happens, they are an impeccable and responsive duo. But tomorrow evening the level of inventiveness and polish is moved up a notch as Howard Alden, the versatile guitarist, joins them in a trio that is a constant scene of musical challenges. The music starts at 8 P.M. There is a $10 minimum at the bar and a $15 minimum at tables, but there is no cover charge. Levinsky's Swing Band Walt Levinsky and His Great American Swing Band, at Michael's Pub, 211 East 55th Street (758-2272). Walt Levinsky's panorama of Swing Era big bands draws on Gene Krupa, Harry James, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, the Dorsey Brothers and Benny Goodman in this second edition of its survey of swing at Michael's Pub. It is not just the spirit of these performances that makes them memorable but also the younger generation of musicians in Mr. Levinsky's band who have become new stars of the big band styles - Warren Vache on cornet, Randy Sandke on trumpet, Joel Helleny on trombone and Spanky Davis on trumpet, playing and singing with his own verve (and with Lynn Roberts) on the Roy Eldridge-Anita O'Day duet on ''Let Me Off Uptown.'' They are at the pub for only one more week (their sixth) after this weekend. They play tonight and tomorrow at 9:30 and 11:30 for a $20 cover charge and a two-drink minimum.
3552	 1999	a	As one of the fastest-growing states in the country, Colorado has the traffic problems to prove it. On any given day, almost any given hour, highways are clogged and tempers are frayed. Arriving late has become a way of life.But Colorado residents have a chance on Tuesday to speed things up, or so say proponents of two ballot initiatives. One would authorize state bond sales to improve highways. The other, for voters in Denver County and five adjacent counties, would expand the light-rail system. Passage of both measures would allow the state to borrow $2.1 billion, which would be repaid with money from the federal highway trust fund.Recent polls suggest that both measures have about a 60 percent chance of passing. Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican who won election last year after promising to improve traffic conditions, has campaigned for both initiatives.''I'm cautiously optimistic,'' he said in an interview, reflecting his belief that both measures will pass. ''Historically with these proposals, the voting has narrowed at the end. This time we have more room to maneuver.''

942	 2013	a	There are now more agents along the 1,954 mile-long border than ever before… Border agents per sector. Staffing has more than doubled in most of the nine sectors along the border, but the growth has not been uniform. Nearly 40 percent of the border staff in 2012 was in Tucson or El Paso, two sectors covering about 500 miles of the border with declining shares of immigrant traffic. They were among the main locations of illegal border crossings during the Mexican migration wave that peaked around 2005.…and apprehensions along the border have dropped sharply … Apprehensions per sector. Overall, apprehensions have fallen as the number of people caught trying to cross the border illegally has declined sharply in recent years, largely because there were fewer people trying to cross the border in the first place. The recession was a factor. But criminal control on the Mexican side of the border and increased border patrol staffing increased the risks and cost of the trip, making it harder to cross successfully in recent years.

3414	 1999	a	Scott Shuger spends the small hours each morning reading newspapers on line and writing a daily column for Microsoft's on- line magazine, Slate, critiquing newspapers across the country. The column, Today's Papers, appears unedited.Last week, Mr. Shuger was the target of some pretty fiery critiques himself.The reason was his comments in last Monday's column about African-American college students. He was critiquing an article in The New York Times about a survey that showed a wide disparity in computer use between students entering elite private colleges and those attending traditionally black public institutions.Mr. Shuger suggested that ''it might be good to add a question to the survey: 'Do you have a luxury sound system or a car less than two years old, or a luxury sound system in that car?' Today's Papers recalls being in Atlanta a few years ago at the annual spring break for traditionally black colleges, Freaknik, and being amazed at the numbers of students' hot cars and loud stereos. Any computer/Internet paucity among students attending traditionally black colleges may be a function of their own interests and choices rather than that of affordability.''E-mail responses to the magazine were overwhelmingly negative, calling Mr. Shuger's remarks ''racist'' and ''idiotic.''

4847	 1991	a	NBC executives yesterday denied charges that they had caved into advertiser fear of homosexual themes in deciding to withhold backing for a proposed episode of the drama series "Quantum Leap" that was to deal with a gay teen-ager contemplating suicide.Perry Simon, the executive vice president of prime-time programs for NBC, said the network had considered the issue of possible advertiser resistance to the episode, but was mainly reluctant to commit to paying for the program out of legimate concerns about its content and the way it had been presented to the network.Mr. Simon said NBC was never consulted about the episode's story line before it was put into production. Such consultation is the normal process for every episode of a television series and especially one likely to be controversial, he said.The executive producer of "Quantum Leap," Donald P. Bellisario, said that NBC had known for months the story line of his project. He blamed the advertising industry for the conflict, saying NBC feared the show would not be sponsored and would lose up to $1 million. He said that NBC suggested at a meeting last week that the show's production company, Universal Television, would have to make up for some of the financial shortfall if the show did not attract enough advertising.

2863	 2003	a	Usually at this time of year, a debate rages about a certain bronze statue presented by the Downtown Athletic Club. It centers on what turns into a bedeviling question: is the Heisman Trophy awarded to the best college football player in the nation, period, or to the best player on the best team?Until Miami rolled over Pittsburgh on Saturday night, 28-14, that issue was going to be argued back and forth until the Heisman ballots were due Dec. 10. No more. Oklahoma quarterback Jason White can book his flight to New York and bring an empty suitcase to take the trophy back home to Norman.Any mystery about the race was removed after White's closest competitor, Pittsburgh receiver Larry Fitzgerald, had a frustrating outing against the Hurricanes. He caught only 3 passes for 26 yards, although one of them was an 18-yard touchdown pass that extended his streak for consecutive games with a touchdown catch to an N.C.A.A.-record 18.Armchair Heisman-ologists can blame Pittsburgh Coach Walt Harris for a game plan that seemed to take his star out of the game: only two balls were thrown Fitzgerald's way in the first half. But the groundswell of late-season Heisman support he garnered was about something else. Fitzgerald has underdog cachet.
4391	 1994	a	Now the cracks are starting to show on wide receiver Mike Sherrard. Sherrard said today he was angry and that he is being left out of the offense.He wanted to make it clear that while he is upset about what he sees as his diminishing role in favor of the rookie first-round draft pick Thomas Lewis, he is more upset about the team's losing. He's a team player. But Sherrard says he has all disappeared from the offense, and in recent weeks has not been in the game on at least half of the third-down situations."I'm not happy about several situations," said Sherrard. "I'm not happy first because we're losing. I'm also not happy because I'm being taken out of the offense and I haven't been told why."The coaches did tell me earlier in the week that Thomas was going to get more snaps and I asked why and they said, 'We want to get him more time.' I'm thinking, 'At my expense? Am I the one who is causing the losing?' It's strange. If they want to get Thomas the ball more I can understand, but why at my expense?"Sherrard has told teammates that he would be shocked if the Giants asked him back next season.He would not comment on this, but it does seem to make sense. Sherrard is earning $1.3 million this season and is scheduled to earn $1.2 million next year. In the era of the salary cap, are the Giants going to pay that kind of money to a player who says he is being phased out? Not to mention that the coaching staff loves Lewis, a speedy player who can also return kicks.

5750	 1985	a	In this week's paychecks, New Yorkers will receive the first few dollars of the multiyear cut in state and city taxes enacted this year.The maximum tax rate on earned income is being reduced to 9.5 percent from 10 percent, and lower withholding rates will take effect Monday. The lower withholding will also reflect an increase in the personal exemption to $850 from $800 and an increase in the standard deduction for single people to $2,500 and other taxpayers to $2,750. The standard deduction previously ranged from $1,500 to $2,500 for single taxpayers and from $2,000 to $2,500 for others.Also taking effect this week is a family adjustment that allows couples to transfer up to $3,000 in income between spouses to lower their taxes.These are some examples of the changes in withholding, according to the new state tax tables:* A wage earner for a family of four earning $200 a week used to have $4.40 taken out of each paycheck for state taxes. Now, $2.70 will be taken out. A single taxpayer earning the same pay will have $5.20 withheld instead of $7.10.

6427	 1970	a	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. — The crowds of vacationers are pouring into Yosemite again this summer, but here and elsewhere across the country there is a discernible difference from previous years: The visitors are spending less.Some of the change traces to economic uncertainties and some to new tastes that have been created by new types of camping equipment.Where once they happily rented tents, or cabins without plumbing, now they drive campers or pull trailers. As alternatives, they want the best accommodations, but they may delay making reservations while they watch the stock market sag.If there is a shortage of facilities, it is at the top and bottom of the scale—shortages of luxury hotel rooms, or of grassy plots where a bed roll can be flopped out.

368	 2017	a	The program offers developers larger credits for building in poorer communities, which tend to need affordable housing the most but also have large minority populations. That has meant that even in a place like Houston, one of the country’s most diverse cities, racial divides can run deep.When she got a federal housing voucher many years ago, Tonya McKinney said, she searched far and wide for an apartment but ended up in Houston’s Fifth Ward, a neighborhood she was not happy with. Founded by former slaves, the community, just east of downtown, has a long history of blight but has undergone significant redevelopment in recent years.Her three children want change, she said.“They talk about this all the time, about us moving into a better area,” said Ms. McKinney, 46, who used to work in retail but is now disabled. “They’re actually tired of living in what they call the ghetto.”The proposed Houston housing, known as the Fountain View Drive project, would be built in the Galleria district, which sits a few miles west of downtown and features shiny office towers and stores. And at 87 percent white, it is an unlikely site for low-income tax-credit housing.While only about a third of census tracts in the nation’s hundred largest metropolitan areas have a majority nonwhite population, 54 percent of new tax-credit projects have been built in those tracts since 2000, according to a Times analysis. And that pattern of placing tax-credit projects in communities with disproportionately high black and Latino populations has been consistent over time, the data shows.The Treasury Department, which administers the program, includes no provisions in its regulations that address segregation. That, fair-housing advocates argue, runs afoul of the Fair Housing Act, which requires government agencies that administer housing programs to do so in a way that reduces racial segregation.“It’s been clear for a long time that the tax-credit program is perpetuating racial segregation,” said Michael Daniel, a fair-housing lawyer.

3532	 1999	a	Despite a veto threat from President Clinton, the House of Representatives today passed a bill that would grant a measure of legal protection to the human fetus by establishing new criminal penalties for anyone who injures or harms the fetus while committing another Federal offense.Supporters of the bill, mainly Republicans, said it would protect ''unborn children'' against assaults and other acts of violence. Opponents said it would undermine abortion rights by granting legal status to the fetus at all stages of development.The bill was approved, 254 to 172, with support from 198 Republicans and 56 Democrats. The measure was opposed by 150 Democrats, 21 Republicans and 1 independent.Under the bill passed tonight, a person who injures or kills a fetus in the course of committing any of 68 enumerated Federal crimes could be convicted of a separate offense against the fetus.

6192	 1975	a	SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1975The Major Events of the DayInternationalOn his first day as Spain's acting chief of state, Prince Juan Carlos de Borbdn presided over a four‐hour Cabinet meeting yesterday that was mainly concerned with the worsening crisis in North Africa, where Algeria warned of war if Morocco continued her efforts to annex Spanish Sahara. Talks between Spain and Morocco over whether Spain would relinquish her dominion over Spanish Sahara were broken off. Meanwhile, a medical bulletin from Generalissimo Francisco Franco's physicians said that he had developed peritonitis, but that his coronary condition had improved. His vital signs were described as normal, and his “habitual lucidity” was being maintained, his doctors said. [Page 1, Columns 2‐3.]The United States and Egypt were reported to he close to an agreement in principle under which Egypt would purchase American nuclear fuel, technology and power reactors. High Administration officials and Congressional sources said that they expected a formal announcement on Wednesday when President Anwar el‐Sadat of Egypt, completing a 10‐day visit to the United States, addresses a joint session of Congress. [1:1.]Secretary of State Kissinger told the House Intelligence Committee that during his more than six years as National Security adviser to two Presidents, no covert intelligence operations had been undertaken by the United States without Presidential approval. His testimony followed that of James Gardner a former State Department aide, who told the committee Thursday that about 40 covert operations were approved by a four‐man subcommittee of the National Security Council, whose members never held a formal meeting. Mr. Kissinger said that Mr. Gardner had meant to imply that any of those operations had not been passed on personally by former President Nixon, he “mistaken.” [1:5.]NationalDavid Packard, chairman of President Ford's 1976 campaign finance committee, has resigned. He is a wealthy California conservative whose recruitment months ago was considered a political coup. He had been an ally of Ronald Reagan. His resignation was the second in a month by a high Ford campaign official. A campaign official said that there had been “some differences” about Mr. Packard's preoccupation with amassing contributions of $1,000, the limit under the 1974 campaign reform law, from customary Republican contributors. “There was a feeling that the money wasn't coming fast enough,” the official said.

153	 2018	a	New this week:THE MAN WHO MADE THE MOVIES By Vanda Krefft. (Harper, $40.) Krefft has written the first major biography of William Fox, the movie mogul whose life story is the archetypical rags-to-riches tale — a boy who worked in a sweatshop on the Lower East Side eventually creates an entertainment empire. PHONE By Will Self. (Grove Press, $27.) The final novel in Self’s massive Umbrella Trilogy exploring technology and psychopathology, this book is set in London and Iraq and tells the story of two men, a psychiatrist losing his own mind and a mysterious MI-6 agent. MY TWENTIETH CENTURY EVENING AND OTHER SMALL BREAKTHROUGHS: THE NOBEL LECTURE By Kazuo Ishiguro. (Knopf, $16.95.) This is the lecture that the most recent Nobel laureate gave in Sweden in early December, looking at his own evolution as a writer and his thoughts on what a new generation of authors must do to keep literature relevant to our lives. IN DAYS TO COME By Avraham Burg. (Nation Books, $28.) The former speaker of Israel’s Knesset gives his own take on his country’s history and the quagmire it now finds itself in as Zionism and Jewish identity evolve to meet the new realities of the 21st century. TELL ME MORE By Kelly Corrigan. (Random House, $26.) Corrigan unpacks 12 essential phrases, from “I don’t know” to “I love you,” that, as she puts it, “turn the wheel of life.”& NoteworthyIn which we ask colleagues at The Times what they’re reading now.“The last time I read PERSONAL HISTORY by Katharine Graham was in 2015, after almost nine years of working for The Washington Post, her newspaper. What struck me most then, though, was her description of her young adulthood in the nation’s capital, and the ‘legions of young men in Washington who grouped together to live in houses.’ Katharine Meyer and Philip L. Graham met at a group-house party in D.C.! I had suffered through so many myself, and mostly what I got were in-person recitations of funny things people had said on Twitter. I’m reading her book for a third time now, after being predictably charmed by the new movie ‘The Post.’ It is remarkable to watch Meryl Streep, as Graham, decide to publish the Pentagon Papers, then read that decision rendered in Graham’s own words. By the time you reach that point in the book, she has talked candidly about pregnancy loss, personal friendships with several presidents, her husband’s suicide — and the way she made history in a job she was never really expected to have. Maybe that would have been too long a movie, but it’s worth treating yourself to the source material.”— Rachel Dry, editor of Sunday Review
14082	 1927	a	I have read the recent attacks on college fraternities by Rabbi Wise and James A. Farrell. For many years I have studied this problem of college life and the more I learn the better I am pleased with it as a whole. It is not perfect, but nothing that is human is, so far as I am aware. It has so many excellent qualities that outweigh its weaknesses as to make it well worth perpetuating. View Full Article in Timesmachine »

6316	 1971	a	The British Petroleum Company, Ltd., realized a 74 per cent increase in third‐quarter earnings on a sales gain of 26.7 per cent, the report from London headquarters disclosed yesterday. The results for the nine months ended with September showed earnings up 108.5 per cent and sales 30.3 per cent ahead of last year's figures.Third‐quarter net income of $87‐million, equalled 24 cents a share and compared with $50million or 14 cents a share for the similar three months last year. Net sales were $1.23‐billion, up from $973‐million.Primarily due to the recession of industrial activity in Europe, product sales fell below expectation towards the end of the third quarter and are continuing at a reduced level during the fourth quarter, the company said. This fall in demand has caused product prices to be affected in some areas, it explained.Net income for the nine months to Sept. 30 rose to $294‐million or 81 cents a share, more than double the $141‐million or 39 cents a share earned in the first nine months of 1970. Net sales were $3.74billion compared with $2.87billion last year.

5290	 1988	a	In his first time at bat against Darwin, Strawberry led off the second inning with a single to left. He raced to third as Johnson singled to right and he scored on Gary Carter's fly to left.The third time he went to the plate, in the fifth inning, Strawberry tripled and triggered a three-run burst. He scored on Johnson's sacrifice fly, and Bobby Ojeda later singled home two runs after Magadan stroked his third single and Kevin Elster doubled.Having hit a single, a home run and a triple in his first three tries, Strawberry had a chance to become only the fifth player in Mets' history to hit for the cycle. (No, he said, if he had hit another home run, he would not have stopped at second.) No Double for Strawberry However, he never got the double. He grounded to second in the sixth inning and was walked in the eighth after McReynolds doubled Dykstra home and Wally Backman to third. McReynolds had hit a home run in the sixth.The 12-run, 16-hit attack was enough to give Ojeda only his second victory in his last eight starts. Ojeda's performance, though, was mixed. The left-hander held the Astros without a hit until two were out in the fifth inning, but in the eighth inning he was unable to maintain a six-run lead and required relief.The Astros actually scored their first run without a hit. With the Mets ahead, 4-0, and one out in the fifth, Ojeda walked Henderson. Craig Biggio, the Astros' rookie catcher from Seton Hall, then hit a grounder to third base, and Howard Johnson, trying for a force at second, threw the ball into right field.Henderson went to third on the error and scored on Darwin's fly to right. It was then that the Astros got their first hit. Billy Hatcher rapped a double to center field, and Biggio scored the second run. Trouble for OjedaA hit by Hatcher caused trouble for Ojeda in the eighth inning, too. It was a leadoff single, and Rafael Ramirez followed with a double to right. Ojeda struck out Bill Doran and retired Glenn Davis on a soft liner to second, but Kevin Bass lined a hard single to center, driving in both runners and reducing the Mets' lead to 8-4.After Ojeda walked Buddy Bell, Manager Johnson summoned Terry Leach, and he ended the rally by getting Terry Puhl, a pinch-hitter, on a line drive to short.

35	 2019	a	Can Technology Save the World (Before It Destroys It)?Sam AltmanCo-founder and chairman of Open AI; president of Y CombinatorOne of the things that surprises me most about sort of the criticism of the tech industry right now is a belief that tech should be the one to decide what you can and can’t say and how these algorithms work. And that, to me, sounds very bad. I think I’m totally cool with, for example, restrictions on free speech where it’s hurting people. And I think we’ve always had, you know, I can’t yell “Fire!” in this room. So there’s always been free speech with an asterisk.But the idea that these companies who are not accountable to us or elected by us should get to decide sort of the new safeguards of society, that seems like the wrong way to do it. And I think we should let our — flawed as they may be — democratically elected and enforced institutions update the rules for the world. The world has changed a lot. Tech has changed the world a lot in a very short time. And it’s going to change it much more.
5408	 1987	a	It took years of legislative debate and judicial inquiry to define and develop today's laws of abortion and artificial insemination. The issues and dimensions of surrogacy are still evolving but it is necessary that laws be adopted to give our society a sense of definition and direction if the concept is to be allowed to further develop. With an increasing number of surrogate births, legislation can avoid harm to society, the family and the child. . . . Many questions must be answered; answers must come from legislation. If there is no law then society will suffer the negative aspects of this alternative reproduction vehicle that appears to hold out so much hope to the childless who make up a substantial segment of our society. $ ? * * *The four experts called by the parties, both hypothetical and clinical, all conclude that Mrs. Stern has multiple sclerosis - albeit, in a mild form and the possibility of progression is limited to unknown. $ ? * * *With regard to Mrs. Stern's disease, all the experts called on this issue conclude that her decision not to become pregnant in light of her knowledge of her disease, her experienced symptomology, the accepted medical understanding of the medical profession at the time that risk of exacerbation was attendant to pregnancy was a medically reasonable and understandable decision. * * *It is argued that the child will not be protected. So long as there is no legislation and some court action in surrogacy arrangements is required, the child born of surrogacy will be protected in New Jersey. If there is compliance with the contract terms, adoption will be necessary; hence court inquiry about best interests must take place. If there is noncompliance with the contract, as in this case, best interest is still litigated with protection to the child. * * *The second argument against surrogacy is that the surrogate mother will be exploited. To the contrary. It is the private adoption that has that great potential, if not fact, for the exploitation of the mother. In the private adoption, the woman is already pregnant. The biological father may be unknown or at best uninterested in his obligation. The woman may want to keep the child but cannot do so for financial reasons. There is the risk of illegal consideration being paid to the mother. In surrogacy, none of these ''downside'' elements appear. The arrangement is made when the desire and intention to have a family exist on the couple's part. The surrogate has an opportunity to consult, take advice and consider her act and is not forced into the relationship. She is not yet pregnant.

5170	 1989	a	For student organizations, rental space at Harvard has always been hard to come by. Now, it's more costly as well, as Harvard raises rental fees for the first time in a decade, in some cases. The largest group affected is Harvard Student Agencies, a student-run corporation that provides jobs for hundreds of undergraduates, writing and publishing the popular ''Let's Go'' series of travel books.On July 1, the rent on H.S.A.'s 3,566-square-foot offices in the basement of Thayer Hall, a dormitory, was raised from $4,100 to $12,000, The Perspective, a Harvard student magazine, recently reported in an editorial. It could not be learned from university officials if the figures - representing close to a 300-percent increase -were correct, and H.S.A. officials refused to confirm or deny them.Martha Gester, associate dean of the college, explained that since H.S.A. is a business, it could cover more of the building expenses on its own. ''The basic philosophy and the agreement in the beginning is that they should cover costs,'' she said. ''There is not a good reason for the university to subsidize them.''Gina Berardi, a senior, president of H.S.A., agreed that the increase was justified, and noted, ''We are not complaining.''

5754	 1985	a	Thirty-seven Mozambicans were reported killed and 62 wounded today when rebels attacked a convoy of buses under military escort south of here. It was the third attack of its kind in two weeks in a war that will not go away.The conflict, diplomats and other analysts said, is paralyzing a nation torn by successive conflicts for more than two decades, where sovereignty is so eroded so that the Government controls little more than cities and outlying outposts.It is a war, one Western diplomat said, that seems stalemated, the rebels unable to penetrate the cities and Government forces unable to extend their writ into the countryside of this nation lying along the Indian Ocean in southern Africa.Mozambican officials said the latest attack took place close to Manhica, 70 miles south of this crumbling whistle stop and only 30 miles north of the capital, Maputo.

1206	 2012	a	On July 18, Premier League club Sunderland revealed its new home uniform.The shirt was not particularly noteworthy. After all, there is only so much you can do with red and white stripes. But those famous colors — Sunderland remains the last striped team to win the title in a English top division — were adorned with a new and unusual sponsor: Invest in Africa. This unique and controversial deal is causing plenty of debate.Invest in Africa is a not-for-profit “partnership of companies” with the declared aim of “promoting Africa as open for business, by challenging misconceptions and inspiring new investors.” The organization boasts of an African middle class of 300,000,000, which is “soon to be bigger than the entire populations of Brazil and Russia combined.” As a result, the publicity material reads, Africa is the “world’s best-kept investment secret.”The company asserts that a shirt sponsorship with Sunderland is a “unique opportunity to use the global reach of the Premier League to help spread prosperity across Africa and bring new opportunities to local businesses.” In return, Sunderland will apparently “build its fan base and global brand, particularly in Africa where nearly 300 million people watch Premier League matches.”When the deal was first announced in late June four men posed outside Sunderland’s Stadium of Light. The club’s owner, the Texan Ellis Short, spoke of a “sponsor that will allow us to grow our market share worldwide.” David Miliband MP, Sunderland vice-chairman and the former British foreign secretary, hollered, “Join us, help build Invest in Africa and reap the benefits.” Midfielder Craig Gardner grinned and posed with a soccer ball. The fourth man was Aidan Heavey, Tullow Oil chief executive and a man with a huge role to play.Tullow Oil operates in 15 African countries and is the “continent’s leading independent oil company.” Tullow is the founding partner of Invest in Africa and, as yet, the only investor in the initiative. While Invest in Africa and Tullow are technically separate entities, the name on Sunderland’s shirt is exclusively financed by the oil company.Since its founding in 1985, Tullow has found a huge amount of oil. The company will soon begin extraction in Uganda (where it estimates reserves of up to 2.5 billion barrels) and recently made new discoveries in Kenya.While the “scramble for Africa’s oil” continues with ferocity, Tullow’s role in the rush for resources has been criticized. In February, Foreign Policy magazine reported on “Uganda’s oil scandal” and the “complete absence of corporate social responsibility on the part of Tullow,” where villagers had been driven off their land with no compensation. Tullow was accused of paying millions of dollars of bribes to Ugandan officials. Tullow denied the allegations and took the unusual step of publishing supporting documents on its Web site.Deep concerns with the allocation of oil resources and corruption, however, persist.After the announcement of Sunderland’s Invest in Africa deal there was some negative reaction in Britain. The London-based N.G.O. Platform saw the arrangement as Tullow “framing its drilling operations in the rhetoric of growth and development.” After this, The Independent published an article on the “concerns over the suitability of Sunderland’s new sponsor.”Tullow once again reacted quickly to the criticism, with its head of media relations giving a series of interviews to the Sunderland fan site Roker Report. In these posts George Cazenove answers questions on exclusion zones for fishermen around oil rigs, corporate social responsibility and transparency.Cazenove responded to the coverage with: “The guys who put together these comments about Tullow are anti-oil and anti-oil in Africa, and they don’t believe that oil companies should be operating in Africa. That’s fine, that’s their perspective, there’s a perfectly coherent, intellectual argument to support that. There’s an equally coherent argument on our side that drilling for oil in Africa and doing business in Africa, which we’ve done successfully for 26 years is a good thing.”Sunderland supporters, meanwhile, are divided. Many have been seduced by the financial possibilities for the club, as Miliband asserted in an interview, saying, “It’s the best commercial deal in Sunderland’s history.” Others feel much more concerned. Some have pointed out that the reputation of the club is now aligned with that of the African oil industry. Many feel morally compromised by the positive language of Invest in Africa and the more complicated situation with Tullow Oil. Some, acutely aware of their place in the soccer ecosystem, simply do not believe the hype. During the launch, Heavey said, “At a stroke, this association will make Sunderland the most popular club in Africa.” That seems unlikely.In the past Sunderland’s sponsors have been local brewers, car dealers and online bingo companies. This big international deal for a midranking club shows how branding and business development dominate the Premier League at all levels. If Sunderland increases its “market share” in Africa successfully enough it may be able to rise a few places up a league already clogged with money. It remains to be seen how many more partners will join Invest in Africa, how Ugandan corruption will be dealt with and how much damage the oil industry may do to the people, politics and environment of Africa.Ed Upright is a freelance journalist based in New York City.

454	 2016	a	Season 4, Episode 12: ‘A Roy Rogers in Franconia’We have not always been kind in this space to Paige Jennings, or to Holly Taylor, the 18-year-old Canadian actress who plays her. When “The Americans” was balancing its Paige story line (teenager finds out her parents are Soviet spies) with its Martha story line (woman finds out her husband is a Soviet spy), we were solidly on Team Martha — her plot won on dramatic and emotional grounds and Alison Wright acted up a storm as the lonely secretary willing to commit treason for love. (Even if her lover was actually Paige’s bigamous father.)But Wednesday night’s episode, “A Roy Rogers in Franconia” (written by the showrunners, Joe Weisberg and Joel Fields), forced a reconsideration. Not a total one — we still miss the exiled Martha desperately. But Mr. Weisberg and Mr. Fields, through sheer persistence and a radical but deftly handled twist at the end of last week’s episode, have managed to make Paige’s between-two-worlds predicament interesting. We finally care about what happens to her, and what’s in her head, rather than just seeing her as a hyperventilating nuisance who’s putting her parents in danger. And while Ms. Taylor’s range remains narrow, it feels as if the character’s evolution toward a kind of resigned fatalism, or exasperation, has been cleverly tailored.The episode started in the aftermath of last week’s random violence, when Elizabeth stuck a knife in the neck of a would-be mugger in front of Paige. At home — where Philip and Henry were happily playing a game of Stargate on the ubiquitous family computer — Paige demanded answers. Was the man dead? Did her mom have to do that? How did she know how to do it? And, most tellingly, had she done it before? Paige’s parents have denied hurting people — which we know is ludicrous — and now Elizabeth had to roll back one more lie, perhaps the biggest one of all. She admitted that she had killed before, but added, “To protect myself, yeah,” which seemed arguable. (Though it’s always for the protection of Mother Russia.)The next morning Paige was still digesting what she’d seen, and getting a new sense of how dangerous her parents’ work must be, if they were trained to do what her mother had done. She was no longer talking about calling the police; she was just trying to adjust her picture of her mother and father to all this new information, and insisting on getting even more.

4763	 1991	a	MANY major league baseball players have bats and gloves with their signatures on them, so it figures a race car driver would choose a car when selling something with his signature.Rick Mears, a three-time Indianapolis 500 winner, and Larry Shinoda have collaborated on the Rick Mears-edition Corvette ZR-1. The car, a copy of which is on display at the New York Automobile Show this week at the Jacob Javits Center in Manhattan, is basically a Corvette with more aerodynamic body work.The Mears Corvette will be available through a yet-to-be-established dealer network for about $53,500. As reward for winning the 1988 Indy 500, Chevrolet gave Mears the first ZR-1 ever made. If Mears does sell the valuable automotive collector's item, the buyer need not worry about hard mileage. Mears said the car is on blocks and he doesn't do much hot-rodding at home in Bakersfield, Calif."The car I drive mostly," he said, "is a Chevrolet truck." But don't call him Grandpa Mears just because he could use a good-driver deduction on his insurance premium. His other cars are a turbocharged Porsche, an Acura NSX and another Corvette -- not the stuff multiple-car discounts are made of.

2675	 2004	a	Because the personal retirement accounts are tied to the workers, not the employers, workers can take their accounts with them when they move to other jobs, keeping the labor market flexible. The system does not penalize or subsidize immigrants, who receive what they have contributed, even if they return to their homelands. We set three basic policy rules for the transition to personal accounts: the government guaranteed retirees that their benefits would not be affected by the reform; everyone already in the work force could stay in the government system or move to the personal retirement account system (those who opted out were given a "recognition bond" calculated to reflect the money the worker had already accrued); and all new workers were required to enter the personal account system.With this system, we ended the illusion that both the employer and the worker contribute to retirement. As economists know well, all the contributions are ultimately paid by workers, since employers take into account all labor costs in making their hiring and salary decisions. To protect the net wages of workers, we initially recategorized the employer's contribution as an additional gross wage.There was no "economic" transition cost, because there is no harm to the gross domestic product from this reform (on the contrary, there is a huge benefit). A completely different issue is how to confront the "cash flow" transition cost to the government of recognizing, and ultimately eliminating, the unfinanced Social Security liability. The implicit debt of the Chilean system in 1980 was about 80 percent of the G.D.P.We used five "sources" to generate that cash flow: a) one-time long-term government bonds at market rates of interest so the cost was shared with future generations; b) a temporary residual payroll tax; c) privatization of state-owned companies, which increased efficiency, prevented corruption and spread ownership; d) a budget surplus deliberately created before the reform (for many years afterward, we were able to use the need to "finance the transition" as a powerful argument to contain increases in government spending); e) increased tax revenues that resulted from the higher economic growth fueled by the personal retirement account system.Since the system started on May 1, 1981, the average real return on the personal accounts has been 10 percent a year. The pension funds have now accumulated resources equivalent to 70 percent of gross domestic product, a pool of savings that has helped finance economic growth and spurred the development of liquid long-term domestic capital market. By increasing savings and improving the functioning of both the capital and labor markets, the reform contributed to the doubling of the growth rate of the economy from 1985 to 1997 (from the historic 3 percent to 7.2 percent a year) until the slowdown caused by the government's erroneous response to the Asian crisis.Personal accounts have become the "third rail" of Chilean politics and the system has been accepted, and even marginally improved, by the three center-left governments of the last 14 years. But it must be said that some labor market problems have increased unemployment and short-term labor contracts, reducing participation in the system and making the future safety net more expensive to maintain.When the system was inaugurated, one-fourth of the eligible work force signed up in the first month. Today 95 percent of covered workers participate. For Chileans, their retirement accounts represent real property rights. Indeed, the accounts, not risky government promises, are the primary sources of security for retirement, and the typical Chilean worker's main asset is not his used car or even his small house (probably still mortgaged) but the capital in his retirement account.

2701	 2003	a	Merry Christmas. Get lost.That, essentially, was the message Robert Pagein received from his employers -- make that former employers -- at Verizon Communications.Mr. Pagein, who is married and has a year-old son, was a field technician who had worked for the phone company for four years. One of the lures of the job was its stability. The pay wasn't great, but it was steady. If you were disciplined you could pay your bills, take a vacation every year or so, and put a little aside.That's the way it works in theory. In reality, Mr. Pagein was one of 2,400 Verizon workers in New York who were shown the door just a few days before Christmas. Those workers formed the bulk of a pre-holiday wave of terminations that claimed the jobs of 3,500 Verizon employees in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states.Mr. Pagein will not be destitute. His wife is working and he has a college degree. But the cold-blooded way in which he and his fellow workers were lopped off the employment rolls by Verizon, and the phenomenal gap that exists between the compensation available to the company's ordinary workers and the fabulous, multimillion-dollar packages taken home by executives at the top of the Verizon pyramid, has shaken his faith in a system he believed in.

4578	 1992	a	"Legacy" is Michael Wood's search for the sources of religious thought that have endured into the 20th century. In the six-hour series, which begins tomorrow at 8 P.M. on Channel 13, the English writer and narrator of such upscale productions as "Art of the Western World" and "In Search of the Trojan War" goes to Iraq, India, China, Egypt, Central America and, finally, to what he calls "the barbarian West" to learn how the past has shaped or misshaped the present.The programs move so fast over such distances of space and time that you may feel left behind. (A map or two might have helped viewers to orient themselves, particularly in the Orient.) But Mr. Wood's breathless enthusiasm and the evocative scenes, notably the festivals in India that continue to draw millions of villagers to Mother Ganges, carry one along.The first two-hour segment begins in Iraq, by the waters of the Tigris and Euphrates, where civilization is said to have begun and out of which came the Biblical accounts of the Flood and the Ark. In the area that entered the Bible as the Garden of Eden, which Mr. Wood visited shortly before the Persian Gulf war, he finds "a blasted landscape"; that not unexpectedly prompts him to reflect on the damage done by the overexploitation of nature's resources.Although he is critical of many aspects of Western civilization, Mr. Wood shows himself to be a good liberal Englishman at heart. The societies that stir his enthusiasm are those, like ancient Baghdad, where many religions coexisted in a spirit of peaceful pluralism. He is pleased with the thought that Abraham, the humane father of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, may have ruled for a time over a piece of what is now Iraq. In the second hour, on India, he focuses fondly on Hinduism, which has traditionally found room for a variety of beliefs, despite a lamentable propensity of some of the faithful to slaughter Muslims and other non-Hindus from time to time.

1615	 2010	a	Fisk University in Nashville, which wants to sell a $30 million ownership stake in its Stieglitz art collection to raise money, plans to appeal a court decision that set limits on the sale, the university announced on Wednesday.The ownership stake is going to the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Ark., but the sale has raised concerns among those who question the university’s need to sell items given to it as a public trust by the artist Georgia O’Keeffe, who married the photographer Alfred Stieglitz.The university filed a notice with the Davidson County Chancery Court in Nashville that it would appeal the Nov. 3 ruling that Fisk could spend only $10 million of the $30 million at its discretion. The remainder would be placed in an independent endowment fund and Fisk would be allowed to use only about $1 million of income from the endowment to support the collection, which was donated to the university about 50 years ago.“This restriction effectively confiscates proceeds from the approved sharing agreement and places Fisk in a more risky position than before,” said Hazel R. O’Leary, Fisk’s president, in a statement.Fisk’s chairman, Robert W. Norton, added, “The order will result in an excessive endowment for the art collection while ignoring the need to endow Fisk’s outstanding academic programs for which it has received national recognition.”

6410	 1970	a	BADEN, Austria, July 2 —International efforts to link the growing consumer movement with the fight against pollution met a harsh response today from African and Asian na tions.“We are not concerned with pollution but with existence.” Dr. Shankran Kristnamurthy, director of the Consumers Council in India, said as the International Organization of Consumers Unions broke into a. series of debates in this gar den city 16 miles south of Vienna. “The wealthy countries worry about car fumes. We worry about starvation.”His remarks were echoed even outside the conference hall by delegates of other poor countries who seemed to reflect a growing worldwide concern.In workshops and meetings of the 30‐nation organiza tion, which was formed 10 years ago to protect con sumers from high prices and shoddy merchandise, delegates from India, Ghana, Malaysia and other countries bluntly questioned the driving efforts of European and American of ficials here to link the consum er and pollution efforts.
1824	 2008	a	Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx Borough president and mayoral candidate, dropped in to an East Side sports bar on Thursday night to kick off a Democratic debate-watching party organized by the Committee of Latinos for Hillary. The bar, Tonic East on Third Avenue in Murray Hill, was pumped with dance music and the raised voices of young professionals straining to chat. A mosaic of big-screen televisions flashed hockey and basketball games. But the high energy wasn’t for Hillary. Amid the regular Thursday night revelry, in a corner of a second-floor balcony, a small crowd of suit-clad Clinton supporters waited for the candidates to speak.Mr. Ferrer, a seasoned politician who has been a government relations consultant since his unsuccessful challenge to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in 2005, welcomed the 25 or so attendees with a joking apology. “It’s been a long time since I’ve addressed supporters from the back of a bar. I’m a little out of practice,” he said into a microphone over the din.Support for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is strong among New York City’s Latino voters. Nearly all of the most prominent state and city Latino politicians have lined up between Mrs. Clinton, who has also received intense coverage in the Spanish-language press.Other debate-watching events in the city had bigger crowds, but this one ended up feeling more like an informal get-together for some key campaigners in Latinos for Hillary than a rousing rally. While there were some Hillary buttons, for example, there wasn’t a Hillary sign in sight.With the noise level in the bar so loud that hearing the debate took full attention, there was also little outward reaction to what was shown on the screen. Obama attracted some nods with his explanation of comprehensive immigration reform, especially his insistence on creating a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. But, said Julissa Reynoso, a lawyer on the Latinos for Hillary steering committee, Hillary’s detailed answer “simply had more meat on it.”“Latinos really connect with Hillary because they feel she has a real sense of compassion for what we are going through,” she said.One thing the Clinton supporters wanted to dispel was the idea that Latinos wouldn’t vote for Mr. Obama because of historic tension between blacks and Latinos. “This is not about being against Obama,” Mr. Ferrer said. “This is about being for Hillary. I am absolutely living proof that blacks and Latinos can come together in an election coalition. It’s what happened for me in 2001 and 2005.” The strong support he received from both groups was not enough, though, in his two unsuccessful campaigns for mayor (in the abbreviated and subdued campaign after the Sept. 11 attacks, he lost the postponed 2001 Democratic primary to Mark Green, who was then defeated by Mr. Bloomberg.)“Hillary’s relationship with the Latino community has always been strong,” Mr. Ferrer added. “It’s a long relationship based on real achievements, not something that happened two weeks ago. She’s stood with us on health care, on access to capital. She’s been with us absolutely every step of the way since the White House.”While pro-Clinton feeling dominated, many of her supporters also echoed the on-stage camaraderie shown by the two candidates. Marcos Vigil, a 32-year-old lawyer who organized the event, said that while he thought Mrs. Clinton would make the better president, he would still be satisfied if Mr. Obama were the nominee.As the debate wound into its second hour, Mr. Vigil said he was impressed by how alike many of the two candidates’ policy proposals were. “Hillary’s seen it all. She knows what to expect, and she understands how the bureaucracy works. But whichever candidate Democrats put forward, we will rally around,” he said.Read more Primary Journal blog entries from the New York region.

3269	 2000	a	Ed McCurdy, a singer and songwriter who was a leading folk music figure in the 1950's, died on March 23. He was 81 and lived in Halifax, Nova Scotia.At the height of the Depression, Mr. McCurdy left his family farm in Willow Hill, Pa., at 18 to become a gospel singer in Manhattan. He slept on floors and went days without food but always managed to pay for voice lessons. He left Manhattan and traveled across the nation, working as a gospel singer and announcer on various radio stations.Influenced by Frank Sinatra, he decided to leave gospel for the secular pop world and try his luck as a nightclub singer. He headed north this time, working in Niagara Falls and Toronto. At a show in Vancouver, he met a dancer who was celebrating her 20th birthday with her fiancee. Three years later, that dancer became Mr. McCurdy's wife, Beryl.In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Jim; two daughters, Dana and Maggie; and three grandchildren, all of New York.

4634	 1992	a	When New York State officials auction off a winning lottery ticket today, it will take more than a dollar and a dream to walk away with the prize. How much more is the question that has been fascinating scores of potential bidders for the last two weeks, but the smart money is betting at least $2 million more.The winner of this unusual event will receive $240,245 almost immediately, and another $3.6 million over the next 15 years. And unlike most state lotteries, which tend to attract a lower- and middle-income clientele, the auction's ground rules suggest that only the rich will be able to play: the minimum bid is $1.3 million.At that price, a successful bidder would be locking in a long-term investment of only modest risk while earning a whopping 21.4 percent a year on the investment -- more than what far riskier investments like Old Masters, stocks and gold bullion have historically yielded. Up to $2.4 MillionBut such a return is unlikely since bidders should be able to justify paying far more than $1.3 million, lawyers, accountants and other financial experts say.

3906	 1997	a	''It is a very, very sticky question,'' a senior Administration official said as the last touches were being put on the Indonesia package this week. ''We can't step into every economic mess. But when the problem of contagion across markets becomes this serious, then it's hard to do what America once did -- regard an economic crisis as a confined event, like a civil war.''What prompted the Administration to move, officials say, was fear that the instability that first racked Asia, then sped to markets around the globe, could turn into something more virulent. Economists have been talking about the dampening effects that continued turmoil in the Asian markets -- and a slowdown in growth -- could have on American exports. That was certainly a concern, Administration officials say. But it was the least of the worries.The bigger strategic concerns come in many varieties and cross a number of Washington's bureaucratic boundaries.The immediate objective of the American action, of course, is what the Treasury calls ''market contagion'' -- the odd ways in which a loss of investor confidence in one nation spreads to others. Often that seems irrational: There is no reason that concerns about Indonesia or Thailand, for example, should rock confidence in Brazil. But currency crises have a way of gathering steam. And in this case, the willingness of governments in Asia to devalue their currencies because their neighbor has -- making their goods more competitive -- has prompted market speculators to suspect that other governments will follow suit lest they be priced out of the export race.President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina explicitly discussed that issue today when he gathered reporters to say that he had been assured by Brazil's President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, that Brazil would not follow the Thais and the Indonesians.
4715	 1992	a	Major institutional fund managers seem to favor European bond markets and the American dollar right now, according to a new quarterly survey by Merrill Lynch. The American bond market, with its uncertain outlook ahead, gets just a neutral nod.The Merrill Lynch survey shows that a lot of big fund managers still hope to take advantage of the capital gains possible in European bonds as prices rise with the decline in interest rates. Yet, at the same time, they are worried enough about a rising dollar erasing their profits from abroad that they are trying to hedge this risk by loading up on dollars now.Michael Rosenberg, the manager of international bond research at Merrill Lynch, said the survey also indicated that the dollar might be in line for a temporary fall because so many fund managers had bought the dollars they need. Dollar Could WeakenThis means that as the year draws to a close, the dollar-buying could taper off and the American currency weaken. Mr. Rosenberg noted that in nine of the last 12 years, the dollar has fallen in the last two weeks of the year in the light trading around the holidays and the closing of financial books.

47	 2019	a	We arrived at the border at Calexico, Calif., on Dec. 31. Despite appealing for help, I was turned away by the Border Patrol agents. Desperate to reunite our family, I found us a way across in the early morning hours of Jan. 1.We were caught by agents after we crossed and taken to one of the detention centers known as “hieleras,” or iceboxes, because they are kept so cold. There I learned that Kevin was taken to the same detention center with Grethshell and she had been separated from her father . Two fellow migrant women told me that five agents held him down while they ripped her from his arms. Other migrant women were asked to watch her.When I and my two other children were released on Jan. 2, my uncle confirmed what the women had told me. Kevin was charged with a felony for returning to the United States after having been deported. He was taken to jail, while our daughter was sent to a shelter for migrant children in San Antonio.The family separation was not reported to the court on his charging documents. The charges against him were dropped, but Immigration and Customs Enforcement is still using those initial charges as an excuse to keep him detained indefinitely while he fights for asylum.I was told I would be reunited with my daughter in a week, but first I needed to fill out paperwork. Then I was told to provide a credit card with up to a $4,000 credit line for her flight, an impossibility for me. Officials refused to say who was looking after her. Finally I got fed up and went to the press. Grethshell was finally put on a plane and brought to me after I threatened to go to the address I had for the shelter manager and get her myself.When a social worker put my daughter in my arms on Jan. 30, she was inconsolable. My whole body shook as I held her and tried to soothe her, telling her that everything would be O.K. She was so sick I had to take her to the doctor the next day. For three weeks she resisted me, fearful, when I tried to hold her. She still cries out for her father at night.I know I am not alone. There are around 311,000 immigrants who have requested asylum after escaping violence in their home countries like us. Our future is uncertain. My children and I were just evicted from the home we shared with six other people. I’m trying to survive as a single mother of three. I don’t know if we’ll be granted asylum or sent back to our deaths at the hands of the gangs.
4146	 1995	a	Although tort reform is all the rage, the number of tort cases -- civil lawsuits in which plaintiffs allege injury, loss or damage from negligent or intentional acts of the defendants -- in the region has remained steady in recent years. The movement to curtail the number of civil lawsuits picked up steam in March when the House of Representatives passed measures that would limit damages in product liability cases, make it more difficult for shareholders to sue corporations and raise the evidence threshold for obtaining punitive damages. The bills are now being considered by the Senate. Experts say the high number of tort cases in this area can be partly explained by high population density, heavy industrialization and traffic. A majority of all tort filings are auto accident cases.

5872	 1984	a	Adjustable rates, which became commonplace in home mortgages as interest rates soared, are fast becoming fixtures in auto loans, the backbone of the consumer loan industry.Jerry Alderman Ford in Indianapolis, for example, was one of the first to offer the new loans, starting two years ago. ''I can count on one hand the number of times our customers have gone the fixed-rate route,'' Steven Edging, vice president and general manager, said. ''Variable- rate loans are here to stay.''John R. Gilker, Ford's manager of marketing and credit, said Ford's move was ''an experiment to test the market reaction; this is an idea that's taking hold in certain parts of the country, and we want to be competitive with the marketplace.''In a fixed-rate loan, borrowers know how much they will repay at what interest rate. But in an adjustable- or variable-rate loan, whether for a house or car, the interest rate, and thus the final cost, may change.

1406	 2011	a	WASHINGTON — President Obama, speaking two weeks after the military ended a ban on openly gay service members, told a prominent gay-rights group here on Saturday night that “no one has to live a lie to serve the country they love.”Mr. Obama received a jubilant reception from the audience at a dinner held by the group, the Human Rights Campaign. He was greeted with a standing ovation and was interrupted him several times with raucous applause, particularly when he declared that “ ‘don’t ask, don’t’ tell is history.”The president strongly supported the repeal of that policy, which prevented openly gay and lesbian soldiers from serving in the military, and he signed the order ending it in December. Gay men and lesbians, he said, were proudly serving around the world -– the only difference being that they could now display their family photos.In a sharp jab at the Republican presidential field, Mr. Obama noted that none of the candidates protested when members of the audience at a recent debate booed a gay soldier who had served in Iraq.“You want to be commander in chief,” the president said, drawing cheers, “you can start by standing up for the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States, even when it’s not politically convenient.”On Saturday evening, at least, the audience seemed ready to overlook that Mr. Obama had not declared his support for same-sex marriage, a refusal that has rankled many gay men and lesbians.“Every single American -– gay, bisexual and transgender -– deserves to be treated equally before the law,” the president said, the closest he came on Saturday to endorsing same-sex marriage rights.Mr. Obama has said his views on same-sex marriage are “evolving.” But since June, when New York State passed a law legalizing such marriages, he has come under mounting pressure to take a stand. At a gay pride reception at the White House shortly after the New York law was passed, one guest wore a button on his lapel that said, “Evolve already.”On Saturday, the president drew attention to other measures he had taken, including legislation requiring hospitals to allow people access to same-sex partners who are patients, an anti-hate-crime law and his order to the Justice Department not to defend the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as being between a man and a woman.Mr. Obama managed to get in a plug for his $447 billion jobs bill, urging the Human Rights Campaign’s members to put pressure on Congress to pass the bill.He also reeled off a couple of jokes. Noting that he had just returned from California, Mr. Obama said he had “held some productive bilateral talks with your leader, Lady Gaga.” The pop diva, with sky-high heels and hair, had towered over the president at a fund-raiser in Atherton, Calif.
3124	 2001	a	To the Editor:Re ''Hard Questions on Nuclear Power'' (editorial, May 29): The least polluting, most efficient energy policy would vigorously pursue wind power, solar energy and hydrogen fuel cells.Our current energy policies, however, are being shaped by those beholden to dirty energy. Their ideological and economic blinders even lead them to promote a revival of Frankenstein-like nuclear power. They ignore or deny the dangers of nuclear energy, the highly polluting uranium mining industry and the radioactive waste that must be isolated for thousands of years.TOM FERGUSONAtlanta, May 30, 2001
5253	 1988	a	According to Ms. Glynn, sales of Tegison were less than $4 million last year, as against $50 million for Accutane. A supply that can last one person two weeks to a month can cost $45 to $70. Figures on how many people take the drug were not available, Ms. Glynn said. But she said that only a third of the people who take it are women and only one-third of those women are of childbearing age.Ms. Glynn added that the company was seeking to determine whether to change its packaging to make the pregnancy warning much more prominent. ''Everything we do for Accutane is certainly applicable to Tegison,'' she said.Not all the women whose babies were born with birth defects were taking the drug when they became pregnant, yet the drug was still in their bodies, Dr. Rosa said. A woman in Brazil became pregnant 11 months after she stopped taking Tegison and gave birth to a severely malformed baby, he said.In West Germany, a woman stopped taking the drug four months before she became pregnant and then had a baby with major birth defects, according to Dr. Thomas Shepard of the University of Washington at Seattle.According to Dr. Rosa, Tegison can be detected in patients' blood more than two years after they have stopped taking it. Strengthening the WarningsAccutane was approved for marketing in 1982 for the treatment of severe cystic acne. F.D.A. epidemiologists at the hearing Tuesday estimated that as many as 9,180 American women had taken it while pregnant and that about 600 had had babies with severe malformations. Sixty-two malformed babies have been officially reported. Yet Hoffmann-La Roche and the F.D.A. had already warned doctors, pharmacists and patients that the drug must not be taken during pregnancy.The advisory board endorsed suggestions by Hoffmann-La Roche to strengthen its warnings and recommended that the drug's distribution be restricted to make it harder for women to obtain it. For example, the board said, the women might be required to get prescriptions signed by a dermatologist and an obstetrician who would have instructed them on birth control.

6251	 1973	a	The statement said that there was “no basis whatsoever — in fact or in common sense,” for the charge by Mr. Agnew's lawyers that officials of the department had leaked information to the press in an effort to prejudice the proceedings against the Vice President. It went on to suggest that Mr. Agnew had precipitated the leaks by disclosing on Aug. 8 that he was under investigation.All day Friday, as he golfed with Mr. Sinatra on the Tamarisk Country Club course bordering the singer's milliondollar estate and rested at one of the four guest houses in the hideaway, the Vice President was said to have fumed about the statement. He re portedly talked of “going public” with a rejoinder and began mentally sketching its outlines.“But he tainped, it all down at breakfast” the next morning, an associate said. “He said it would not be good politics” to spell out what was on his mind, but decided to make “one or two points” after completing the delivery of a prepared speech on the need for secrecy in the grand jury to protect, the innocent.The Vice President's aides passed the word to newsmen at the Los Angeles Convention Center that Mr. Agnew would make some pointed comments at the end of the address. He did, without notes, and “once he got started it was as if he couldn't stop,” the associate later remarked.Mr. Agnew referred to having “been living in purgatory” because of unspecified charges against him. He said that the violations of grand jury secrecy were not his fault but “deliberate, contrived actions” of Government prosecutors. The Atig. 1 letter received from United States Attorney George Beall in Baltimore, notifying him that he was under investigation, was made available to The Wall Street Journal even before he received it. Mr. Agnew declared.The associates said that the Vice President regretted his omission of one point that had troubled him — the published speculation that he had sought to make a deal with the prosecutors, offering to resign if the charges were dropped—and that he later wished he had denied those accounts on television.Instead, he told a group of Republican officials with whom he met after the speech that the “plea bargaining” had been initiated by the Justice Department and had, never been. seriously considered by him. His aides then let newsmen know of the private discussion.

1155	 2012	a	James Estrin/The New York TimesWEDNESDAY’S PUZZLE — There’s something very meta about a crossword puzzle where the entry that reveals the theme to you is the answer [CROSS]WORDS. And yet, that’s exactly what happened to me during this very enjoyable solve.Paula Gamache is back, and she seems to be feeling “out of sorts”; CROSS, even. Let’s see if we can cheer her up.Ms. Gamache’s offering is a Scrabbly, twisty puzzle where the theme entries are a variety of words that can have the word CROSS added to them to make something different. We also have a welcome CROSS payoff at 38 Across, and I liked the fact that another starred entry (BOW) crosses the word CROSS right in the middle. It would be tough not to get Ms. Gamache’s intent here.Another thing that made this puzzle enjoyable for me was the amount of fresh material, and each one is a very lively, “real word” entry (in some grids with more extensive wordplay, theme entries will register as “new” simply because they are not real words or phrases that would otherwise make sense to put in a puzzle.) We have MR. ZIP and MR. PINK, the lovely SEAHORSES, as well as THIRD CLASS and the wonderful BUYS TIME.“Jewish wedding rings?” is a very funny clue for anyone who has ever tried to make a decent circle while dancing the HORA (actually plural in the puzzle.)So I hope you feel better, Ms. Gamache. No need to be CROSS. In my opinion, this was a lovely midweek grid.In fact, I wanted to play the video “Always Look on the Bright Side of Life” from “Monty Python’s Life of Brian,” but there’s the matter of that one non-standards-meeting word, and I couldn’t find a clean version. But you can just hum it to yourself if you like.Your thoughts?

3232	 2000	a	TELEVISION in the next century will surely be about choice. No matter what form the television set itself takes, the number of programs it delivers will be virtually limitless with the notion of separate, distinct channels all but extinct. Instead, every home will have the ME channel -- really a series of channels, one for each member of the family, offering a completely individualized lineup of programs assembled from the all-but-infinite selections pulsing through the digital web.Thus television, the most effective mass medium ever devised, will be undermined as a vehicle of mass distribution -- and with it will go the hit show. Why? Because the same digital forces will also affect magazines, newspapers and radio, causing them to narrow their focus -- and making it almost impossible for producers to establish a new show among a wide variety of viewers at the same time. There will be no reason to broadcast a show at a given hour (except for live events like sports), so the possibilities for creating a nationally popular entertainment program will be drastically limited.With few bona fide hits, advertising revenues will most likely shrink. That will mean a switch to an almost entirely pay-per-view system for the ME channels, just like at a movie theater.Programmers will try to counter with interactive communications, made possible by the merging of the television and the computer, to create instant word of mouth about new shows.
5217	 1988	a	In separate testimony, a G.S.A. official, Thomas H. McQuown, said that an employee of U S West, Karl Payne, told him that Mr. Soni had given the A.T.&T. pricing information to U S West, BellSouth and Bell Atlantic.Mr. McQuown also said in his deposition that Mr. Soni had instructed his secretary to make copies of A.T.&T.'s bid proposal. Under G.S.A. rules, all copies have to be provided by the bidder, not made by the agency, because the bids are supposed to remain secret. Mr. McQuown also said that Mr. Soni had suggested to him that they should convince the regional companies to lower their bids below A.T.&T.'s final offer, which was submitted before the final bids of most competitors. Prohibition on MealsSeparately, the Pacific Telesis Group, which won a switch contract in San Francisco, said last week that one of its marketing managers bought two meals for Mr. Soni. The G.S.A. prohibits employees from accepting meals from potential bidders.The recent diclosure that agency officials knew that the regional companies had access to A.T.&T.'s price information but did not prevent them from bidding heightens existing concerns about the agency's ability to conduct an impartial procurement. The G.S.A. has said that, to its knowledge, Mr. Soni is the only agency employee for which there are substantial allegations of misconduct. But it now appears, according to last week's testimony, that other G.S.A. officials are involved.Although the current dispute centers on the phone-switch contracts, it is seen as jeopardizing the Government's plans to replace its antiquated telephone system with an ultra-modern communications network at a cost of about $25 billion. Bids for the FTS-2000 contracts, which represent billions of dollars in revenues to telecommunications and computer concerns, are due by the end of March. Ameritech Inquiries CitedTwo G.S.A. employees testified that the agency had received what they concluded was an inquiry from Ameritech about A.T.&.T's bid.Reva Hutchinson, who supervised the switch contract bidding, said that a G.S.A. cost evaluator informed her about a call from an Ameritech official, Bud Sheldon. The cost evaluator told Ms. Hutchinson that Mr. Sheldon had called her and asked about A.T.&T.'s proposed pricing. Mr. Sheldon mentioned the $40 price to the cost evaluator. Ms. Hutchinson testified that the cost evaluator had said she did not think it was appropriate information for Mr. Sheldon to have because it was A.T.&T.'s bid price.

5580	 1986	a	Any anticorruption legislation introduced in the State Senate this session is expected to focus on city, rather than state, government.That emphasis, however, would put the Republican-controlled Senate at odds with Governor Cuomo, who has responded to New York City's municipal scandal by introducing wide-ranging ethics legislation that would tighten financial disclosure requirements for state officials and, by barring them from practicing law before state agencies, limit their earning power.The Democratic-controlled Assembly has quietly organized a task force, led by Oliver G. Koppell, a Bronx Democrat, to consider an ethics package. Speaker Stanley Fink and other key Assembly members have been unusually quiet about what form their legislation is likely to take, but the assumption among Capitol insiders is that it will, in moderated form, resemble the Governor's.In the Senate, however, Warren M. Anderson, the majority leader, has repeatedly asserted that anticorruption measures ''should not be aimed at the Legislature when the Legislature is not the problem.''
4347	 1994	a	Aaron Glenn makes sure the ball is hidden from the veterans.Even Saturday, an off day at the Jets' summer camp, Glenn told his fellow rookie Ryan Yarborough to hide it."It's in his car," disclosed Glenn. "In a safe place."The ball is symbolic, true. But it is also very important to Coach Pete Carroll, who has entrusted Glenn, his top draft pick, with watching over it.Carroll is the rookie head coach, and he has adopted this philosophy as he oversees offense, defense and special teams: the ball."We want to control it," he said. "We want to keep it on offense, and turn it over on defense."His role as head coach, for now, is to be around the ball on the practice field. He is not coaching players on where they stand or how they move. But every player understands what Carroll is doing.
2950	 2002	a	Lewis Katz, the Nets' principal owner, wrested the trophy from the hands of the team president, Rod Thorn, and just held onto it for dear life.He passed it to Kidd, who kissed it. One hour after the Nets' victory, Katz had the trophy back, still cradling it, not wanting to part with it. ''I'm speechless,'' he said.''I knew we were good, to get to the finals, in one year, I didn't think we could do that. It's tremendous,'' Harris said.Kidd, when it counted most, finished 15 points, 13 rebounds and 13 assists.''I think Jason in the back of his mind felt like he had something to prove, just like the rest of us,'' Van Horn said.Van Horn and Kittles never stopped making key contributions in this series. They completed the most crucial play of the game. With the Nets leading by 91-88, Kittles was falling out of bounds on the left baseline when he flipped a pass to Van Horn at the top of the arc. Van Horn, waiting patiently, had just visualized the moment, his 26-footer falling through the net with 50 seconds. The Celtics were done.''I saw the play develop, right when Kerry drove,'' Van Horn said. ''I knew I was going to get the shot. The history of their defense was that they collapse. I anticipated the whole play, but I didn't expect Kerry to make the pass with his left hand falling out of bounds. There aren't a whole lot of guys in the league that can do that.''When Kidd hit two free throws with 33.9 seconds left, the Celtics' season was over.Thorn was overcome with emotion in the locker room, recalling the final minute of the game after Van Horn's shot. ''I was almost out of body, to tell you the truth,'' Thorn said. ''Guys were congratulating me all around. I was like, 'Are you crazy?' After that last game Saturday we played up here, it's not over with until the last second is ticking down.

474	 2016	a	WASHINGTON — Thousands of immigrants with criminal convictions, including for assault and attempted murder, have been released from detention because their native countries refused to take them back, according to statistics recently released by the Department of Homeland Security.The inability to deport the criminals has prompted outrage among lawmakers and advocates of tighter immigration laws, who say that the Obama administration could be doing much more to pressure uncooperative countries.But the department faces a number of obstacles. It is legally barred from indefinitely detaining immigrants who cannot be repatriated. And poorer nations are often reluctant to take back violent offenders because they have limited resources to deal with them.The release of such immigrants into American cities is a particularly charged aspect of the national debate over immigration. Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has painted a grim picture of immigrant criminals menacing the streets.
42	 2019	a	Mom is right when she says to eat your peas.In one of the largest surveys of data on global dietary habits and longevity, researchers found that consuming vegetables, fruit, fish and whole grains was strongly associated with a longer life — and that people who skimped on such healthy foods were more likely to die before their time.The study, published on Wednesday in the British journal The Lancet, concluded that one-fifth of deaths around the world were associated with poor diets — defined as those short on fresh vegetables, seeds and nuts but heavy in sugar, salt and trans fats.In 2017, that came to 11 million deaths that could have been avoided, the researchers said. Most of those, around 10 million, were from cardiovascular disease, researchers found. The next biggest diet-related killers were cancer, with 913,000 deaths, and Type 2 diabetes, which claimed 339,000 lives.“These numbers are really striking,” said Dr. Francesco Branca, the top nutritionist at the World Health Organization, who was not involved in the study. “This should be a wake-up call for the world.”

4458	 1993	a	As expected, two executives at Doremus & Company in New York have formed their own agency with a creative focus. In a surprise, however, a third partner in the new shop, which will be part of the Omnicom Group, is coming from outside the agency.Parry Merkley, president, and Stephen Harty, executive vice president and director of client services at Doremus, have teamed with Jane D. Newman, vice chairman worldwide and head of account planning at Chiat/Day in New York, to open the latest Omnicom unit, Merkley Newman Harty, effective Monday.The new shop, with 40 employees, will open with billings estimated at $40 million from a base of Doremus's traditional financial corporate and consumer clients, including Forbes, Casio, Bankers Trust and Word Perfect."We are not pining for the glory days of advertising that will never return," Mr. Merkley said in a telephone interview yesterday. "It is a different world now, and it is essential to us that we are completely involved in the clients' business goals, not just the advertising goals."

202	 2018	a	But her submission also reminded me of how much can be learned when journalism becomes more communal and conversational. I would never have known about cakes like the “Maypole” or “Rocking Horse” — nor would I have known they were such cultural touchstones — if not for our attempt to throw open the doors, and invite in readers’ stories. Your stories.Looking back over the past year, there are so many things I wouldn’t have known if not for readers of this newsletter.The responses to last week’s Australia Letter about history taught me just how common it was to grow up in Australia years ago without being taught Indigenous history — something I hadn’t realized since my own children are receiving more of that education in their public school.If not for all of you, I also wouldn’t have grasped the depth of appreciation for Nippers, nor the nuance and divisions that shape discussions of race and multiculturalism, or gender and power.I would have missed out on many great books, restaurants, music and movies that many of you suggested; I would have misunderstood the rivalry among Australia’s capital cities, or the degree to which people care so much about those that are often overlooked — I’m looking at you Darwin, Adelaide and Perth — if not for those who wrote to tell us what they loved about where they lived, and why.I could go on but the point is, for our first anniversary, I’m not going to boast about all the journalism we did that I’m proud of, though there’s a fair amount of that.I’m just going to thank you for making the journalism better.Foreign correspondence is nothing if not an attempt to understand, and our bureau’s understanding of Australia — even for those who are Australian — has occurred at an accelerated pace thanks to you.
5939	 1982	a	L ong before the doors opened at the OTB parlor on John Street yesterday, the line of bettors stretched for part of a furlong toward Nassau Street. They stood with Racing Forms in their hands and what passed for hopeful expressions on their faces.It was the first day of operations for the office, No. 147 in the city's Offtrack Betting system. The opening of a parlor has become an event. It was only the second this year. In fact, there are eight or nine fewer betting offices now than several years ago, reflecting a malaise that lingers like a tapped-out player.''A $2 bet is a $2 bet is a $2 bet,'' said Sam Kanchuger, an OTB spokesman. ''It's a bad paraphrase of Gertrude Stein. But it's getting very hard to keep the growth going.''By that, Mr. Kanchuger means that rent and salaries are going up faster than the OTB handle. In the 1980 fiscal year, $893 million was bet at offtrack windows. That dropped the next year to $869 million. It was back up in fiscal 1982, ending last June, but the $882 million was still below the 1980 figure.

310	 2017	a	The president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin, articulated a possible legal strategy on Wednesday for scores of Russian athletes preparing to defend themselves in sports doping prosecutions: casting doubt on the chain of custody for their urine samples.“When we provided the test samples, there were no complaints,” Mr. Putin said, going on to describe the microscopic scratches on glass sample bottles that investigators said showed that Russia’s Federal Security Service had cracked into them to switch out the athletes’ incriminating urine.“If there was a problem with scratches of whatever kind, this should have been noted in the relevant reports, but there was nothing of this sort. In other words, these samples were stored somewhere, and we cannot be held responsible for the storage conditions,” he said.The scores of glass bottles in question from the 2014 Sochi Olympics — bottles thought to be tamper-proof before last year’s scandal — have been stored by the International Olympic Committee in a secure lab in Switzerland for the last three years.

712	 2015	a	PhotoRead in Chinese | 点击查看本文中文版We’re in Beijing — no, Beiping — Dec. 10, 1979. It’s year two of the presidency of Chiang Ching-kuo, son of Chiang Kai-shek. China has been an American ally since Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang, or Nationalist, forces defeated Mao’s Communists in the civil war that ended in 1949. The Chinese capital is still Nanjing. The Dalai Lama remains in Lhasa. Hong Kong is a British colonial backwater. China is prosperous.PhotoIt’s also repressive. Opposition parties are at most decorative; human rights advocates are hunted down. But in the 30 years since the war, after which the Communists scattered abroad, many to the Soviet Union, China has followed a path that diverges sharply from the history we know today. No class struggle, no purge of landlords, no Anti-Rightist campaign against intellectuals, no Great Leap Forward or the catastrophic famine that followed, no Cultural Revolution. The progress achieved in education and civil society under the Nationalists from 1911 to 1949 has continued.Welcome to Chan Koonchung’s alternative history novel, “The Second Year of Jianfeng,” recently published in Chinese in Hong Kong. (It is not yet been translated into English.) Jianfeng was the courtesy name for Chiang Ching-kuo, which Mr. Chan imagines as the name for his rule. In an interview, Mr. Chan addressed the central question of his book: What if China had not gone Communist?Q.Could things have been different?A.The Chinese Communist Party insists that “history has chosen the C.C.P.,” and without the party, there would be no strong and prosperous new China. I want to show the possibility that China could have become strong and prosperous much, much earlier.History is not “determined” and is not as inevitable as Communist dogma would like us to believe.The first 30 years of Communist rule under Mao Zedong, before Deng Xiaoping’s economic reforms, were a total waste of time, an unnecessary historical detour with an unspeakably immense humanitarian cost.Q.Would China have been better off if the Nationalists had won the civil war?PhotoA.China would definitely have been a nicer place. It would still have had things that were wrong, but much less than what actually happened. Such as, there wouldn’t have been a Cultural Revolution.There are some things the Nationalists would have done worse. For example, they were more tied to the triads. But I think that by 1979 the Nationalists would have achieved something very similar to what the Communists are achieving now, 37 years later, but with more equality in society.Q.How difficult was it for you to construct an alternative history for China?A.I thought it would be very difficult, but it turned out much easier than I thought. It took less than a year to write, though I spent a lot of time preparing for it. I had to think, how would the Kuomintang have ruled? For that I had to think about the Taiwan elite as it was.I picked several real people to tell the story. One was Zhang Dongsun [a philosopher and democrat who declined to take sides between the Communist and Nationalists and died in prison in Beijing in 1973]. I took the actual words they said and put them into different contexts.Q.How did you envision the alternative reality?A.I wasn’t aiming to make a utopia out of China. But maybe because of the success in Taiwan, I can say that they would have done something similar to that.Of course, the U.S. and China would have been allies from the very start. The coastal cities of China would have boomed from 1949 on, because the U.S. was the big economy at the time so whoever could export to the U.S. had a boom.In Taiwan after 1949, the Kuomintang did carry out land reform, so I speculated that they would also have done that in China. It was very successful in Taiwan, and the reason is it was nonviolent and cooperative. Landlords were made shareholders in state-owned companies and given loans. They turned into capitalists and promoted industry.Industrialization took off after that. If they had done something similar in China, it would have been great. The Communists did it differently. They used class struggle and killed off the old owners.There would still have been a Korean War, because Kim Il-sung was very ambitious and believed he could conquer South Korea in a few days.Q.How would Chinese culture have fared?A.In 1968 [in the book, the novelist] Lao She becomes the first Chinese writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, while in real life he was pushed to commit suicide [in 1966] during the Cultural Revolution. Old temples, antiques and historic sites might simply have been neglected, instead of willfully destroyed by the Red Guards, as happened in reality.Q.Are alternative history novels demanding on the reader?A.I didn’t explain a lot. I depended on my readers’ understanding of Chinese contemporary history to make comparisons and to enjoy reading between the lines.Follow Didi Kirsten Tatlow on Twitter @dktatlow.

2481	 2005	a	Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students share opinions about nutrition. They then compare the nutritional values of a snack product claiming health benefits with a candy product. Learning is synthesized by reflecting on the responsibility of companies, individuals and the government in determining whether a product lives up to its claims.Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hourObjectives:Students will:1. Share opinions about nutrition and discuss the foods they eat.2. Learn about a new chocolate bar that purports to have significant health benefits by reading and discussing the article “An Apple a Day for Health? Mars Recommends Two Bars of Chocolate.”3. Compare a product that purports to have health benefits with a traditional chocolate bar.4. Write a reflection paper that addresses the issue of corporate, individual and government responsibility in determining what foods are truly healthy.Resources / Materials:-pens/pencils-classroom board-four large pieces of paper, each with one of the following statements written in large letters: “Strongly Agree,” “Agree Somewhat,” “Disagree Somewhat,” “Strongly Disagree”-copies of the article “An Apple a Day for Health? Mars Recommends Two Bars of Chocolate,” found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20051101tuesday.html (one per student)-resources for researching nutritional facts including textbooks, health journals, cookbooks and computers with internet accessActivities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Before class, post the four statement posters (“Strongly Agree,” “Agree Somewhat,” “Disagree Somewhat,” and “Strongly Disagree”) in the corners of the classroom. Since students will be moving around to stand beneath the statements with which they most agree for different questions, be sure they have easy access to each corner. Read each of the statements below aloud and ask students to move to the corners of the room that best express their views on that subject. As students take their places, write the statement on the board. Then, ask at least one student in each group to share his or her opinion.-Foods that taste good can’t be good for you.-Food companies can be trusted to provide accurate information about the health benefits of their products.-Foods that benefit one aspect of health may be detrimental to other aspects.-Eating a well-balanced diet provides for all of your nutritional needs.Ask students to what degree, if at all, nutritional value determines how they choose snack foods (chocolate, candy, chips, drinks, etc.)?2. As a class, read and discuss the article “An Apple a Day for Health? Mars Recommends Two Bars of Chocolate” //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20051101tuesday.html, focusing on the following questions:a. What product is Mars Inc. beginning to market?b. What health claim does the company state about the product?c. Why did they decide to add plant sterols to the product?d. How many daily servings of the product does the company recommend?e. Why do they believe that their product will be successful?f. Why are some nutritionists skeptical about the product’s health claims?g. How have the company’s competitors responded to the release of the product?h. Who is Harold Schmitz and why does he say that he is troubled by the competitors’ claims?i. How might the competitors’ claims affect the sales of CocoaVia?j. Who funded the scientific research on the benefits of flavanol in dark chocolate?k. What does Bonnie Liebman mean by her statement that the “marketing is getting ahead of the science?”l. Why are flavanols typically stripped from chocolate?m. How did Mars Inc. resolve that issue?n. Why did the company’s advisory board set a calorie limit for the product, and what was the result?o. In what other products can plant sterols be found, and why might they be considered healthier than CocoaVia?3. Explain to the class that they will compare the nutritional value of a snack product on the market today that purports to have significant health benefits with a chocolate bar to determine the relative health benefits of each. To begin, divide the class into pairs and have each pair choose a product from the Health Bar and Chocolate Bar categories (some suggestions are listed below). To aid them in their research, provide students with the current daily nutritional guidelines (provided by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration at //www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/flg-7a.html). Students will work together to gather information and answer the questions for consideration (listed below and provided as a handout for easier student access):HEALTH BARSCocoaViaBalanceOdwallaLunaKudosNature Valley granola barPowerBarSlimFastCHOCOLATE BARSHershey’s milk chocolate barM&MsNestle’s CrunchGhiradelli dark chocolate barReese’s Peanut Butter CupBaby RuthSnickersThree MusketeersQUESTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION -What are the nutritional facts for each product (provided on the nutritional facts label)?-What are the purported health benefits for each (if stated on the packaging)?-How are the two products different and similar in terms of their nutritional content, calorie content, sugar content, etc.?-How does each product measure up when judged against the current nutritional recommendations set by the Food and Drug Administration.-According to the food label and nutritional recommendations, does the health bar seem to achieve its health claim?-Are there other means of acquiring the health benefits promoted in the health product? If so, what are they?-Based on the relative nutritional facts, the health claims and any other facts about the products, would you prefer to eat the health bar, the chocolate bar or a natural health product?If possible, have students conduct a taste test of the two products and ask them to compare the taste as an additional factor to consider.Toward the end of class, have students present their findings. For further discussion, ask them the following questions:-Would you eat a product that claimed to be healthy even if it did not taste good?-Is it reasonable for companies to claim that a product is healthy even if it includes ingredients that may not be beneficial to one’s health?-What products do you currently consume that claim to have significant health benefits? Do you choose the product because of the health claim? If so, do you believe that you are acquiring the purported health benefits?4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: In the article, Bonnie Liebman states “the marketing is getting ahead of the science.” Write a reflection paper (1-2 pages) that responds to this statement and considers the following questions (written on the board before the end of class):-What is the responsibility of a company in making a claim about health products based on sound scientific research?-What is the responsibility of the consumer in investigating health claims made by health products and the companies that market them?-What is the responsibility of the government in regulating what companies can claim in terms of health benefits to consumers?Further Questions for Discussion:-Why might candy and soft drink companies invest in products with purported health benefits?-How might current trends in health and nutrition affect a company’s decision about the products they produce, and how they market them?-What information do you look for when determining what foods to eat?-To what degree do you consider the nutritional value of the foods you eat?-To what degree might cost determine whether you choose a healthier but more expensive food product versus a less expensive but also less healthful one? Would you buy a healthier food if it cost more? At what point, if at all, might the cost outweigh the relative health benefits?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on participation in the opening exercise, thorough investigation of their products in the group work and thoughtful preparation of their reflection papers.Vocabulary:confections, quest, indulgence, wafts, antioxidant, additive, tribulations, siege, macro, skeptical, conferring, vascular, exploiting, prototype, engineeringExtension Activities:1. Create a “How It Works” poster on the health benefits of flavanol. Where in nature is it found? What foods contain it naturally? Identify and compare a natural and a manufactured food that contain flavanol. How much of each would you need to eat daily in order to gain significant health benefits?2. The article claims that heart disease is the number one killer in the world. What is heart disease? What genetic factors or behaviors contribute to heart disease? How is it diagnosed and treated? Does the disease affect a particular segment of the population (men, women, young, old, etc.) more than others? What dietary guidelines are recommended for the prevention of heart disease? What activities or behavior modifications are recommended for the prevention and treatment of the disease? Write a report of your findings.3. Investigate health fads over the last century. To what degree did scientific reports affect the design, production and/or marketing of food products? Identify one health fad and write a critical analysis of its scientific basis, and the impact on the food industry and consumers. Do current reports on health support or debunk the health fad you investigated?4. Compare the nutritional value of white chocolate, milk chocolate and dark chocolate based on the current nutritional recommendations. Create a chart of your findings.Interdisciplinary Connections:American History- Choose a U.S.-based chocolate company (Ghiradelli, Nestle, Hershey’s, Mars, etc.) to investigate. What products has it sold in its history? How, if at all, have the products changed or adapted to food trends? Do you have an idea for a new chocolate bar that might be a hit among your peer group and that reflects current thinking in nutrition? Write a letter to a chocolate company proposing your new product and how it might be marketed to today’s youth.Civics- Why does the Federal Drug Administration require food products to list their nutritional contents? How does the agency determine daily nutritional values? How, if at all, does the agency regulate claims made by food companies? Are food companies required to consult with the FDA before claiming that a product is “healthy?” Write a research report of your findings.Economics- The health food industry is a multi-billion dollar industry. What companies produce and market health products? What other products do they produce or market? Identify one health food product and investigate its parent company. What else does the parent company produce and/or market? When did the parent company start selling the product? Is any rationale given for why it began to produce and/or market the product at that time? What was the annual revenue for the product for the first year in the market? What are its current revenues? Produce a market analysis of the product’s success in the market relative to the company’s other products.Media Studies- Imagine that an ingredient in your favorite snack food was just reported to have significant health benefits. Like CocoaVia, the product might also include some ingredients that are not necessarily “healthy.” How would you market this product? How, if at all, would you balance promoting the health benefits and providing information (or warnings) about the possible negative effects of the product? In creating your campaign, identify your target audience. Develop a campaign designed to reach the target group in terms of both the information you provide and the way in which you communicate your message.Teaching with The Times – Read the Health section of The Times every week for one month and clip articles that report on nutrition. Do the reports offer recommendations designed to alter current dietary habits or that support existing recommendations? Do the reports reflect your own dietary habits? If not, how, if at all, does the information provided in the reports reflect and/or impact your own dietary habits? At the end of the month, write a reflection that summarizes how your diet compares with the findings and/or recommendations in the articles, and whether any of the reports have changed the foods you buy or the way you eat.

2539	 2004	a	The peer-to-peer world of the Internet is taking a step onto the nation's freeways in a cellphone application that aims to offer up-to-the-second traffic information.Until now peer-to-peer networks have conjured up file-sharing systems like Napster and Kazaa or social networking organizations like Friendster, Orkut and Linked-in.But Zipdash, a start-up in Palo Alto, Calif., hopes to take advantage of the growing number of mobile telephones with global positioning satellite receivers to gather the travel speeds of thousands or tens of thousands of drivers, displaying highway conditions as maps on cellphone screens.The Zipdash application displays a map of traffic speeds as green, yellow and red arrows, graphically representing traffic jams and bottlenecks. The company plans to add features, including route planning and accident alerts. The service will be free to cellphone users and Zipdash is planning to create a business by selling accurate traffic information to Web sites and other publishers.

4801	 1991	a	The suffering of the Iraqi people cries out for compassion. Shortages of food, medicine, clean water and electricity now threaten to cause more death and disease than the Persian Gulf war. Indeed, the worsening plight of Iraq's vulnerable children and powerless adults virtually demands some easing of the economic sanctions. Why make the Iraqi people suffer for the crimes of Saddam Hussein?But the sanctions remain one of the few levers by which the allied coalition hopes to disarm Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biological capabilities. As Iraq disdainfully evades international inspectors, the allies know they need every bit of pressure they can muster.There may be a way out of this dilemma: Permit Iraq to resume oil exports, but impound the earnings and apply some of them to humanitarian assistance.Satellite photos and defectors' reports make clear that Iraq continues to violate the terms of the United Nations cease-fire. Iraq supplied misleading accounts of its nuclear arms program and still tries to conceal arms-making equipment and facilities from international inspectors. As if to underscore reports that Washington is weighing military options, President Bush says "all means necessary" may be used to enforce the cease-fire resolution. But bombing during the war did not succeed in eliminating Saddam Hussein's nuclear capacity.
2364	 2005	a	Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students learn about the iconic status of Albert Einstein. They create trading cards about famous scientists and write a job description seeking a potential heir to the Einstein legacy.Author(s):Priscilla Chan, The New York Times Learning NetworkBridget Anderson, The Bank Street College of Education in New York CitySuggested Time Allowance: 1 hourObjectives:Students will:1. List what they know and wish to know about Albert Einstein in a K-W-L chart.2. Learn about Einstein’s iconic status and future scientists on his level by reading and discussing the article “The Next Einstein? Applicants Welcome.”3. Create, in pairs, trading cards about Einstein and another notable scientist.4. Develop a job description that seeks out “the next Einstein.”Resources / Materials:-student journals-pens/pencils-paper-classroom board-index cards (two per pair)-trading cards (baseball cards and/or other collectible cards; optional)-copies of the article “The Next Einstein? Applicants Welcome,” found online at //www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050301tuesday.html (one per student)-resources about Albert Einstein and other famous scientists (computers with Internet access, almanacs, library resources, encyclopedias, etc.)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Before class, create a KWL chart on the board to complete as a class. (Create three columns: the left – K – column should be titled “What Do We Know?”; the middle – W – column should be titled “What Do We Want to Know”?”; the right – L – column should be titled “What Did We Learn?” The K and W columns will be completed at this point in the lesson; the L column may be filled out after the completion of the research in Activity 3 below.) Upon entering class, students respond to the following prompt in their journals (also written on the board prior to class): “Copy the following table into your journal, and write at least two statements in the K and W columns about Albert Einstein.” After a few minutes, allow students to share their responses and copy them onto the chart on the board.Discuss, as a class, what students know or believe about Albert Einstein, including his achievements, background, fame, legacy, etc. Students may write their opinions in the W column as statements they would like to determine as true or false about the scientist.2. As a class, read and discuss the article “The Next Einstein? Applicants Welcome” (//www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20050301tuesday.html), focusing on the following questions:a. Why was Albert Einstein, in his adolescence, not likely, in many eyes, to amount to scientific greatness?b. What are some examples of Einstein’s stunning success in science and society?c. Why does Einstein’s development as a scientist both “comfort” and “haunt” people, according to the article?d. How does Dr. Michael Turner describe Einstein’s appeal, and why is this description an important quality for scientists?e. Why might it be “distracting, daunting and ultimately demoralizing” for a younger scientist to be called “the new Einstein”?f. To what does Dr. Stephen Hawking attribute the constant comparisons of new scientists to Einstein?g. What does it mean to articulate “the role of the individual in modern science,” according to the article?h. What combination of qualities did Einstein possess that helped him achieve his iconic status?i. Why is the field of physics “vast and sprawling”?j. What does Dr. Edward Witten consider to be Einstein’s notable reason for success?k. How does Dr. Michael Turner measure a scientist’s impact, and using this measurement, how does Einstein compare with other scientists?l. What are the different conceptions and images of “Einstein,” according to the article?m. What was the social/political background during Einstein’s heyday?n. According to the article, what were some other descriptors for Einstein, besides “the Elvis of science”?o. What, according to the article, are some distinctive attributes of Einstein as described by other physicists?p. What is generally considered Einstein’s greatest achievement?q. Why is general relativity described as “the result of pure thought”?r. How did Einstein’s personal and political life alter his love of science, if at all?s. What is meant by Einstein’s “perceived irreverence”?t. How does science represent a field by which someone without a “privileged background” can succeed?u. How did Einstein typically start off his papers?v. Why have philosophy and physics become distant, according to the article?w. In what ways has modern science entered into the popular consciousness?x. How does Einstein compare with Watson and Crick, or Dr. Stephen J. Hawking?y. Where is the place for new ideas in physics?z. What are the two conceptions of reality, in terms of general relativity and quantum mechanics?aa. What attempts to bridge these two differing conceptions?bb. According to the article, what are possible “Einsteinian opportunities”?At this point, students may draw facts from the New York Times article for the L column from the Warm-Up activity about what they have just learned about Einstein.3. Explain that students, in pairs, will be researching, using available sources, enough information to create two scientist trading cards (using index cards): one on Albert Einstein and one on another scientist of note. (If available, teachers may distribute baseball or other collectible cards as examples of trading cards before proceeding with the activity.) Possible suggestions are some of the scientists mentioned in the New York Times article like Dr. Stephen Hawking or famous scientists of the past such as Marie Curie, Rachel Carson, Charles Darwin, etc. Encourage students to engage their own creativity and originality in creating the trading cards. At minimum, cards must have:-a picture of the scientist-basic biographical information such as date and place of birth (and, if applicable, death)-a list of achievements, discoveries, awards, etc.-memorable quotes-other interesting facts or trivia about the scientistOnce students have completed their trading cards, they should join together into groups of two pairs (four students). Students should first compare and contrast their Albert Einstein trading cards. As pairs share, students should also add to the L column from the Warm-Up activity the new facts they learn about Albert Einstein. Then students should show their second card and describe the scientist they have selected to profile. Students may discuss which of the profiled scientists might have, or have had, the potential to reach iconic status like Einstein and why.4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Individually, students complete the following task (written on the board for students to copy down before leaving class): “Recall the headline of the New York Times article: “The Next Einstein? Applicants Welcome.” Look at want ads and other resources on the Internet or in a newspaper and come up with a list of information generally found in a job posting for a scientist, such as organizational description, academic or work experience, compensation, etc. Then write a job description for a scientist that you feel would engage applicants with the potential to be the ‘next Einstein.'” In a future class, have students share their job descriptions.Further Questions for Discussion:-What is the most influential scientific discovery of your generation? Of your parents’ generation?-What are some examples of philosophical quandaries?-Do you think Einstein is “overrated”? Why or why not?-Do you have to understand science to fully appreciate Einstein’s achievements? Why or why not?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on initial journal responses, thoughtful participation in class discussions, cooperation in small groups, creation of trading cards about famous scientists, and job descriptions seeking the “next Einstein.”Vocabulary:echolalia, reinforced, beaned, swapped, lurching, dread, stroke, perennial, hanker, haystack, biding, bowels, cosmologist, infuriate, nonplussed, distracting, daunting, demoralizing, disconnect, iconic, concurrence, charisma, duplicated, vast, sprawling, dominate, unsung, quasar, subatomic, stomping, waxing, vexing, metric, firebrand, racking, pretensions, embodiments, sage, conscience, distinctive, ferret, consensus, tempestuous, unvarying, irreverence, humble, simultaneity, quandary, mantle, donned, chaosExtension Activities:1. Choose one of Einstein’s scientific accomplishments and create a children’s book describing the discovery in both easy-to-understand text and visuals.2. Make a list of the heroes or icons in current popular culture. Think about both fictional and real-life heroes. Compare and contrast the characteristics of a fictional and a real-life hero. What makes each one a hero in the public’s eyes? Is it something he or she did in the past, or something done over time? What sets him or her apart from other characters or people? Do heroes tend to have certain interests or occupations?3. Search the Internet for images of Einstein. Why was he so photogenic? What personality attributes are captured by these images? Imagine you are the curator of a photo gallery exhibit on Einstein. What text descriptions would you give of each photo?4. Einstein’s discoveries are often difficult for young students to understand initially. Explore the Web Site devoted to Einstein at the American Museum of Natural History online (//www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/). Describe at least five strategies used by the Web site to make the science more accessible to a younger audience.5. Einstein was considered a genius. What does that word mean? Browse the following Web sites: //www.cse.emory.edu/sciencenet/mismeasure/genius/research04.html and //hem.bredband.net/b153434/Index.htm#Introduction about the “intelligence quotient,” or IQ. Research the controversy surrounding IQ tests. First, learn about IQ tests, what they test, how they test it and what different score levels are supposed to represent. Then look for critiques of IQ tests. Describe the main criticisms and alternative intelligence assessments that have been created. Write an opinion essay about whether you think IQ tests are a legitimate test of a person’s intelligence, and why. Does Einstein’s high IQ make you view him in an even more iconic manner?Interdisciplinary Connections:Global Studies – Create a timeline reviewing Einstein’s role in the movement against global nuclear proliferation. Why was he called “humanity’s atomic conscience”?Media Studies – The New York Times article notes that Dr. Stephen Hawking says that constant comparisons of him to Einstein have less to do with his own accomplishments and more to do with “the media’s need for heroes.” What does he mean by this sentiment, and do you agree? Write an essay in which you cite examples of, or lack of, this “need.”Teaching with The Times – Keep a scrapbook of newspaper articles that paint someone as “heroic” or worthy of iconic status. Are there patterns to the types of “hero” stories that are reported in The New York Times? Write an analysis in which you cite your clippings and describe differing definitions of hero or icon.

3306	 2000	a	The program's computer system manages all patient searches, tracks detailed patient histories and maintains the four-million-member registry. At any time, it is processing searches for more than 3,000 patients. The donor program communicates online daily with 350 to 400 groups around the country, including hospitals, community groups and donor centers.In transplant centers, Mr. Shepherd said, new online tools provided by the program shorten the time it takes to search national and international registries to find matches. In some cases, the search for a potential unrelated stem-cell donor that used to take a day can now be done in seconds.There are dozens of independent bone-marrow and related registries worldwide, and they do not share all their information. Most, but not all, do share the basic tissue data for the more than 6.4 million people worldwide who have given samples; it is forwarded to Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide, in Leiden, the Netherlands. That group's Web site, www.bmdw.org, is open to doctors and the public, and includes technical data, information about how to become a marrow donor, extensive links to more information about the procedure and cancer treatment, and information on donor registries worldwide.''It's not updated as often as some of us would like,'' said Dr. Dennis L. Confer, the chief medical officer for the National Marrow Donor Program. The international registry updates its list monthly. For information other than the basic tissue types, doctors have to write, phone or send faxes or e-mail to the individual registries, Dr. Confer said.''More and more, the ability to access donors through online communications is going to become the norm,'' he said.Pamela J. Weisdorf, director of the program's office of patient advocacy, said its Web site was being redesigned for user-friendliness with the help of a 12-member advisory group, including patients and their family members. ''They want information about their disease,'' sometimes even before they know they need a transplant, she said. ''One of the other things they tell us is, 'Please, you have to put things into language we can understand.' ''There is also a difference between Web language and medical language. Take the word ''search,'' Ms. Weisdorf said. It means one thing to most Internet users, but to patients facing a life-or-death deadline, it means searching for an unrelated-donor match.
4323	 1994	a	Hilly Kristal, founder and owner of the seminal East Village punk club CBGB, called the policy unfortunate. "I would take each request separately," he said. "The music itself does not stir up anything terrible, and a lot of these kids who come to see it and listen to it are fine. There can be 500 people, and maybe 10 or 15 who cause the trouble." Verifying NamesAlthough the city has many restrictions on large events held in public spaces, especially Central Park, until yesterday the Parks Department had dealt loosely with smaller events.It has not required photo identification cards so that the city could verify the name and address of a permit seeker.The city has always made concert promoters post bonds, on average, of $250 for cleanup. If the organizers failed to restore parks to their original state, they forfeited the money. But the $250 was low compared to the real cost, Mr. Stern said.Under the changes, he said, the city will have greater flexibility in imposing higher cleanup bonds -- as high as $5,000 -- on high-risk concerts and locations. "If there's a history of violence or failure to clean up, the bond will go up," he said.John Miller, deputy commissioner of public information for the police, said the department does not keep statistics on the violence rates of one group of music fan versus another. "We can't characterize one form of art as causing more aggression than another -- albeit we haven't seen Mozart fans looting on the streets."Parks officials said Summerfest had a permit to showcase local heavy metal, rap and punk rock bands, from 2 to 6 P.M. Because of technical difficulties, said Susan Alexander, an organizer, the concert began late and, with the agreement of the police, ended at 6:17 P.M. The authorities do not dispute this point, but disagree on what ensued.

6232	 1973	a	Official confirmation of a 24‐hour New Year's Day bombing halt throughout all of Vietnam was expected from the United States command in Saigon. Spokesmen for the command were refusing to confirm the pause during the day, apparently following a pattern established when the command announced a 36‐hour Christmas pause after it had passed. The pause was in observance of a New Year's Day cease‐fire proclaimed by both the Communists and the Saigon Government. [Page 1, Column 8.]MONDAY, JANUARY 1, 1973There were clear signs in Washington that President Nixon's halt in the bombing of North Vietnam above the 20th Parallel had brought him little, if any, respite from Congressional criticism of his Vietnam policies. House Democrats will caucus tomorrow—the day before Congress is scheduled to convene—and vote on a sense‐of‐the‐party resolution calling for a cut‐off in military spending in Southeast Asia. [1:6–7.]The people of Hanoi were able to get a full night's sleep for the first time since the United States bombing began two weeks ago. Fewer people wore helmets, but as many as ever dug air‐raid shelters, for the average Vietnamese is not convinced that the bombing is really over. [1:7–8.]Pope Paul VI, though ill with influenza, made an appearance in an open window of the Vatican's Apostolic Palace and spoke severely about the United States bombing of North Vietnam before giving his customary Sunday blessing, He disclosed that in recent “contacts with the interested parties” in the Vietnam war he had appealed for an end to the bombings and new negotiations. [3:6–8.]
6091	 1977	a	The treasurer and the director of aviation of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey were suspended without pay late yesterday after admitting “irregularities” in their expense accounts, the agency announced.The suspensions of the two men—Alexander Leslie, the treasurer, who is paid $52,000 a year, and Caesar B. Pattarini, the aviation director, who receives $61,000—were ordered and announced by Peter C. Goldmark Jr., the authority's executive director.Mr. Goldmark said both officials “had voluntarily reported the irregularities and in each case the individual had indicated his willingness to reimburse the Port Authority for the minor amounts of money involved.”The action came five days after the suspension of another top official of the agency, John Tillman, the $55,000‐a‐year chief spokesman and director of public affairs, who admitted after an investigation by The New York Times that he had regularly padded his expense accounts with fictitious entries since 1974.
2510	 2004	a	Correction AppendedHelicopters swept the sky, and clusters of police officers stood guard on street corners. But for revelers in Times Square, the New Year's Eve countdown was about party, not panic.With the nation on a heightened terror alert, security was tight throughout the city. In Times Square, where crowds began forming early yesterday afternoon, police officers looked through backpacks and checked celebrants with metal detectors.Even so, revelers streamed into Times Square for the time-worn tradition. Though there was no official crowd count, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said the numbers were high.''We're going to have a record crowd tonight, they are backed up to Central Park,'' he said as he left dinner at a Times Square restaurant.
4086	 1996	a	On the barren stage of the Liberty, which looks bombed-out, Ms. Shaw is illuminated by only a few unshaded light bulbs and the artfully placed spotlight. The image she creates is mesmerizing, as is her fluid control of her slightly husky voice.The performance is mesmerizing, but is this really Eliot? And, for that matter, can such a piece work as theater? Or should it? I think not, but that's no excuse not to make the attempt. There is something about the communal nature of theater that contradicts the spirit of Eliot's isolating, hallucinatory, often impenetrable visions and his densely packed allusions to Shakespeare, Milton, Virgil, Sophocles, Verlaine, the myth of the Grail and, well, you name it.''The Waste Land'' is to be read at one's own speed, often haltingly, as one stops, goes back and starts again, in this way to gather momentum to make the next leap from the vividly particular to the abstract and apocalyptic. Unless you're a don, there's no other way to obtain a purchase on this most complex of modern masterpieces.If you accept these limitations, and if you read the text first, this ''Waste Land'' is something to which you can pay attention without feeling that you have failed it. You certainly should pay attention to Ms. Shaw and Ms. Warner. For some time now, they have been stirring up the London theater scene with a succession of celebrated and/or controversial productions, including a ''Richard II'' in which Ms. Shaw played the title role, and Samuel Beckett's ''Footfalls,'' which so outraged the Beckett estate that attempts were made to close it.Ms. Shaw and Ms. Warner take their work seriously.'The Rehearsal'There are some very good things in the Roundabout Theater Company's revival of ''The Rehearsal,'' the witty, tartly sentimental Jean Anouilh comedy, first produced here in 1963 and now being seen in a fine new English translation by Jeremy Sams. He is the man responsible for the English version of Jean Cocteau's ''Indiscretions'' (better known as ''Les Parents Terribles'') produced on Broadway two seasons ago. Though ''The Rehearsal'' lacks the roaring humor and rue of Anouilh's ''Waltz of the Toreadors,'' it is an exceptionally satisfying work. This production, directed by Nicholas Martin, has beauty, style, humor and the most cohesive acting ensemble to appear at the Roundabout in some time.''The Rehearsal'' belongs to that group of Anouilh plays in which the artificiality of theater is compared to the artificiality of real life. The setting is post-World War II France and a chateau where some all too sophisticated aristocrats are putting on a production of Marivaux's 1723 classic, ''La Double Inconstance'' (''The Inconstant Lovers''), whose tale of innocence betrayed parallels the story of the contemporary play. If you happened to see the splendid Comedie-Francaise production of the Marivaux at the Brooklyn Academy of Music earlier this year, your pleasure will be enhanced.The victim of ''The Rehearsal'' is Lucile (Anna Gunn), a sweet, unspoiled young woman, governess to the orphans who are housed in one of the chateau's more remote wings. The Count (David Threlfall), being bored by both his wife, the Countess (Frances Conroy), and his mistress, Hortensia (Kathryn Meisle), casts them in supporting roles and asks the governess to play Sylvie, Marivaux's heroine, who is somewhat more resilient and believable than Lucile.

2910	 2002	a	''They moved out to the sticks,May as well be in heaven.''I note the sunset in the west.He says: ''This road is going east.''Yes dear, I say, you know what's best,But the sun does set in the west.Trude HofsteinDear Diary:The other afternoon we encountered a young, harried yuppyish matron in the mailroom of our East Side apartment house. As she fumbled for her mailbox key, she kept muttering a litany of complaints to herself, ranging from an absent nanny to her husband's shirts, a thoughtless business partner and a missed yoga class. A tiny infant slept peacefully at her breast, cradled in a sling.She left the mailroom and in the lobby claimed a double carriage in which sat two angelic little girls -- twins, about 2. In the elevator, with the buttons pushed, I asked if they were identical. The harried mother looked at me. ''We don't know yet,'' she said in a flip tone. ''We haven't had time to check, we haven't time to do anything. But don't bother to tell me how cute or adorable they are unless you're willing to take them off my hands for the weekend.'' Alan MountBuck Glenn was waiting in line to buy stamps at a West Village post office. The woman in front of him was accompanied by her daughter, perhaps 3 years old. The child was playing with the postage forms and envelopes. ''Come here,'' the mother said, and the girl ran to her, accidentally knocking over a pile of IRS tax forms. The child stared at the forms on the floor and then stomped on them. The mother simply said, ''Well done, dear.''Dear Diary:My mother's Cartier watch had stopped, and as it was a lovely day, she decided to walk to Cartier instead of taking a taxi. Her arthritic knee acted up, though, and as she tottered into the store she was badly in need of help. She went to the nearest counter and said, ''Young man, do you think you could find me two aspirin?'' Not a usual request at Cartier, I am sure, but he responded with alacrity and returned with the aspirin and a glass of water. She then went to the watch department, where they quickly repaired the timepiece, and she took a cab home.''And so, my dear,'' she told me (I live in Tucson) ''if you're ever in New York and need an aspirin, just go to Cartier and ask.''Conchita CollinsJoan Pursley thought she had heard every possible street request for money, but she got a new one during the last cold spell. As she got out of a cab at the Avenue of the Americas and 14th Street, she was approached by a man with a cup who said ''Can you help me? I'm trying to get to Hawaii.'' She usually hands out change, but she was so amused she gave him $1.

5414	 1987	a	SNARING Robin Williams for the lead role of Tommy Wilhelm in Saul Bellow's novella ''Seize the Day'' must have given the producers cause for celebration. Mr. Williams is a singularly gifted comic actor and comedian, a master of dizzying improvisation. Unfortunately, his performance in ''Seize the Day'' - a ''Great Performances'' presentation on Channel 13 at 9 this evening - is a miscasting fiasco, all the more regrettable because so much intense care has been so obviously spent on the production. The lineup of established talent is impressive. Robert Geller, whose credits include public television's ''American Short Story'' series, is the executive producer. Fielder Cook is the director, and Ronald Ribman did the adaptation. A promising roster, indeed.But despite a wealth of beautiful bits and pieces, ''Seize the Day'' fails to hold. For one thing, Mr. Williams is physically wrong. Mr. Bellow's Tommy Wilhelm, whose given name is Wilky Adler, is a big, brawny man in his mid-40's, his blond hair just beginning to go gray. If comics are required for the part, Steve Martin would have been more suitable or, better yet, the late Dick Shawn. Mr. Williams is a short, dark-haired man in his 30's who, with his pronounced mid-America accent, doesn't stand a chance of being taken for a New Yorker of Jewish background.Worse, Mr. Williams miscalculates on the intensity of his performance. In the original story, taking place over a few days in 1956, Tommy is heading for a nervous breakdown following the loss of his salesman job and a bitter separation from his wife and two sons. With the story ''opened up'' for dramatization, Tommy is seen going through these earlier troubles. From the very first scene, though, Mr. Williams is a man falling apart, whimpering pathetically when not screwing up his face into odd contortions. There is no disintegration. He is virtually certifiable from the outset. There is no drama. Tommy is a foregone conclusion.What's left is a scenario calculated to unsettle, possibly even offend. Most of ''Seize the Day'' is set in an Upper West Side hotel with a residential clientele that is almost exclusively Jewish. Mr. Bellow offers a world of the elderly whose only yardstick for success is money - who has held on to the most and whose children are earning even more. It is a suffocating, unpleasant universe of greed and selfishness. It is here where the failed Tommy must struggle to survive. But he is viciously cast aside by his own wealthy father, also living at the hotel, and swindled by the bamboozling Dr. Tamkin, supposedly an analyst, who talks him into investing in lard futures. While Tommy pleads for kindness and mercy, his disappointed father tells him ''it's torture for me to look at you.'' His unforgiving wife is out to see him suffer and even his children turn their backs. His only source of sympathy is gentle Olive (Glenne Headly), his Roman Catholic woman friend living in Massachusetts.
4065	 1996	a	Mike Tyson dispatches his opponents so quickly that one of the country's major cable operators has offered an unusual discount to pay-per-view fight fans who have cried foul after shelling out $39.95 or more.If Tyson, 30, dispatches the 34-year-old Evander Holyfield -- or vice versa -- in Round 1 of their bout on Nov. 9, subscribers will pay only $9.95. But for every round the bout goes beyond that, there will be an additional $9.95 charge, up to a maximum of $49.95 if it lasts until the fifth or beyond.The arrangement was proposed yesterday by Jim Dolan, the head of Cablevision, which is in 2.8 million of this country's 60 million households that are wired for cable television. He said that the pricing gimmick was a way to deal with people who were resentful over fights lasting less than a round. ''We wanted to correct that,'' Dolan said.But officials in Las Vegas, Nev., where the bout will be, expressed concern that the arrangement could affect the credibility of the bout, which would generate more money for Cablevision the longer it lasts.
4961	 1990	a	This is the home and the era we like to pretend we remember - ''when life was slow and oh, so mellow'' and ''when no one wept beside the willow.''The inhabitants of Fantasticks-land are two middle-aged fathers who garden and play cards, one 20-year-old man who has not developed beyond the level of a young adolescent and one 16-year-old girl who is as riddled with far-fetched notions of romance as Swiss cheese is with holes. There are no mothers around to get in anybody's way.The manipulative fathers have built a wall between their houses on the perverse theory that if they discourage their children from being friends, the boy and girl will assert their independence by growing up and getting married.''The Fantasticks'' spins a plot that is pure romantic fantasy shaded by the golden glow of make-believe. Its philosophy is conservative in spirit: in this musical, the only place for a woman is in the house, the world that begins on the other side of the garden's kumquats is not worth visiting and the love you find among your own kind is best.In the Studio Theater production directed by Macey Levin, the show seems to traipse along at an unduly slow pace. It is as though the actors have moved along through the three decades since ''The Fantasticks'' opened, and are now forcing themselves back in time as if they were walking backward across a sticky field of discarded spun sugar. Nothing in this production seems to without great effort.
1992	 2007	a	Can anyone make heads or tails of this? Why does the N.F.L. care that a church wants to use a 12-foot-wide projector to show the Super Bowl?The full article from The Indianapolis Star is here.An excerpt follows:The thousands of churches across the country that want to host Super Bowl parties Sunday night had better not pull out big-screen TVs, or they could face the wrath of NFL attorneys. For groups that want to host Super Bowl parties — other than sports bars and businesses that normally show televised sports — here are rules the NFL says must be followed: • No admission fees (even to pay for snacks). • Only one television (55 inches or smaller). • No use of the words “Super Bowl” in promotional materials. • No exhibition of the game in connection with events “that promote a message.” The NFL is telling Fall Creek Baptist Church in Indianapolis that the church’s plans to use a wall projector to show the game at a party for church members and guests would violate copyright laws.NFL officials spotted a promotion of Fall Creek’s “Super Bowl Bash” on the church Web site last week and sent pastor John D. Newland a letter — via FedEx overnight — demanding the party be canceled.Initially, the league objected to the church’s plan to charge partygoers a fee to attend and that the church used the license-protected words “Super Bowl” in its promotions.Newland told the NFL his church would not charge partygoers — the fee had been intended only to pay for snacks — and that it would drop the use of the forbidden words.But the NFL wouldn’t bite. It objected to the church’s plans to use a projector to show the game on what effectively was a 12-foot-wide screen. It said the law limits the church to one TV no bigger than 55 inches.The league even took exception to the church’s plan to influence nonmembers with a video highlighting the Christian testimonies of Colts coach Tony Dungy and Chicago Bears coach Lovie Smith.P.S. About that last sentence: We can’t have any “promotional messages” that divert attention from the commercials, can we?Also: Slate weighs in with an article titled “Is My Super Bowl Party Illegal?”

2288	 2006	a	On Tuesday, I moderated a panel at, of all things, the United Nations. It was pretty cool to sit down in a U.N. conference room, complete with those little earpiece thingies for hearing translations (although no translators were on duty–rats).Anyway, the panel was all about free and open-source software and how it might benefit the U.N.’s member states. The panelists included six advocates of free software–for example, representatives from Novell, I.B.M. and Red Hat, all of whom have developed thriving consulting and support businesses around free software like Linux–and a Microsoft rep. He valiantly enunciated Microsoft’s current attitude toward the open-source movement: for example, that Microsoft welcomes and has learned from the competition, and that the market has plenty of room for both proprietary and free software.What made things especially interesting was that only two seats away from him was Richard Stallman, the influential founder of the free software movement and a man who does not mince words.Mr. Stallman does not like Microsoft. Wow, does he not. He mentioned that when the U.N. sent him the information about the panel in a Microsoft Word document, he refused it and requested a different format. During the panel, he called Microsoft evil, said that the U.S. government is in Microsoft’s pocket, and at one point faced the Microsoft guy and shouted, right there in the United Nations conference room, “You are a deceptive person!”A good time was had by all.Seriously, though, many countries (or departments within them) are already making the switch to open-source software. They save money up front because the software doesn’t cost anything, but there are other motivations, like security (they can inspect the source code) and, in some countries, the hope of generating jobs for local programmers and administrators.If you believe the companies who are offering open-source packages–and not everyone does–the momentum is clearly on the free-software side, that the tide is turning, and even that the days of the proprietary-software monopoly are numbered.As I mentioned at the end of the seminar: Let’s all meet back here in ten years and see how things turned out.

25	 2019	a	“It’s going to come into play, quite frankly, in the elections next year. We’re not going to let it go away,” Carol Tobias, the president of the National Right to Life Committee, the country’s largest anti-abortion group, said of New York’s law and Virginia’s defeated proposal.“You’re going to see articles written and speeches, and our affiliates around the country are going to take it up,” Ms. Tobias added. She singled out a video clip of the Virginia lawmaker, Kathy Tran, earlier this week acknowledging that her bill would allow, in certain circumstances, for a woman to request an abortion when she was about to give birth.Ms. Tran later clarified that she “misspoke” and that the bill would not allow the prevention of a live birth.Nonetheless, the clip of her initial comments, already viral, was further amplified when Virginia’s Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, was asked during a radio interview on Wednesday about Ms. Tran’s bill. Mr. Northam, a pediatric neurologist, said late-term abortions would be permissible in cases of severe deformities or nonviable fetuses, and described a situation in which such an infant would be delivered, and then a “discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.”Conservatives seized upon the answer as proof that Mr. Northam approved of killing an infant even after it was delivered, even as Mr. Northam’s office said the reply was taken out of context and called the idea that he would support such a proposal “disgusting.”“That’s going to be played in legislative bodies around the country or at least used to lobby,” Ms. Tobias, of the National Right to Life Committee, said.It already has: Virginia’s Republican Party sent a fund-raising email with the clip of the Virginia lawmaker; the National Republican Congressional Committee has also attacked several newly elected House Democrats from Virginia, trying to link them to the debate in the statehouse. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida likened the Democratic proposals to legalizing infanticide, and the former United Nations ambassador, Nikki Haley, said the idea made her sick.

247	 2018	a	The solution — taxis that could only operate away from the areas dominated by yellow cabs — now seems so 2011, which is when the Bloomberg administration first proposed it. The new category of taxis that was created, the green cabs, could not pick up passengers in Manhattan south of East 96th Street or West 110th Street. They can stop if someone hails them anywhere in the other boroughs, except at the airports.By coincidence, 2011 is also when Uber began operating in New York.Now, some passengers say green cabs tried, but never fulfilled their promise.“They filled a crucial void in areas like Harlem where yellow cab service was spotty at best” when they first hit the streets, said Derek Q. Johnson, who lives in Harlem. “But I think it’s hard to dispute that the ride is better with Uber and Lyft and the reliability is more assured.”Different rules apply to green cabs at airports, where they can drop off passengers but cannot pick them up, except by prearrangement — for example, if they are sent there by a dispatcher. Many drivers complain that those rules force them to go to the airports empty if they are dispatched for a pickup or return empty if they take someone there. Unlike yellow cabs, they cannot wait in the taxi lines. Uber and the other ride-hailing apps are not bound by airport rules.The yellow-cab industry responded to the plan for green cabs by going to court. Yellow cab owners worried that the value of their million-dollar medallions would plummet.The city won the court challenge and the value plummeted, but not because of competition from the green cabs that went on the streets in 2013.“Unfortunately, they came along at the same time as Uber and Lyft,” said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor at New York University where he is the director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management. “The benefit of Uber is it can come pick you up in highly dispersed locations, which the green taxi can’t really do because it’s got to stay near dense transit pickup locations.”

4969	 1990	a	To the Editor:In her review of ''The Loony-Bin Trip,'' Rosemary Dinnage asks, ''Should not . . . psychiatric staff take antipsychotic medication for a time as part of their training in order to know what it feels like?'' No. The reason is that ''what it feels like'' differs depending upon the state of mind of the subject at the time. Given to a patient already depressed, these antipsychosis medications intensify the experience of anguish and distress. Given to someone in a normal state of mind, the drug creates a distressing sense of enervation. Given to the acute psychotic, however, it provides a very welcome relief.Most manics, no matter how bad their judgment is, resist taking medication that threatens to take away their mania. They enjoy the mania in the same way that individuals who are high on cocaine enjoy their high and do not willingly give it up. Both will come for treatment only when they have crashed into depression.As characterized by Ms. Dinnage, Kate Millett's argument is not correct: mania is not creative. Hypomania, that is, a state of exhilaration in which judgment is not seriously impaired, can be extremely creative. Because of the impairment of judgment that accompanies it, mania is disruptive and destructive, though it is not recognized as such until the individual recovers from it.MORTIMER OSTOW, M.D.Bronx

231	 2018	a	He and my mother separated the following summer after 28 years of marriage. That was 2003. I chose my mom. I didn’t have to take sides, but I did. I flooded his email with hateful letters, blaming him for everything wrong in my life. “You were a terrible father,” I wrote. “I will never forgive you. I won’t go to your funeral.”Things only got worse when he remarried and developed a close relationship with his stepchildren. For them it seemed he couldn’t do enough. I spent hours staring at pictures on Facebook. The proud dad at graduation. The proud father of the bride. I wondered what made them better than me. I concluded that the difference was, he didn’t have to raise them. They were grown-ups. He could drink beers with them. But I believe he loved them very much.My anger began to lessen when I got married in 2014. I once read that a good relationship can heal old emotional wounds, and for me that proved true. We began to text and there were even occasional visits — like that time we met for lentil soup — but things were never great. I never met his family. During his murder investigation, I was interviewed as a person of interest.On Thanksgiving, his last one on earth, he sent me a message asking if I wanted to talk. “If so, I’ll call,” he wrote. I never replied. Another read: “Have so much I want to talk about. Maybe one day if you are ready.” I ignored that too. I didn’t feel like dealing with it; there was just too much to unpack. Another day.People have asked me, “Was it harder when you thought he was murdered?” And my answer is no. The suicide is harder. It is so much harder. I thought he died in his prime, a happy guy on his way to meet a friend for a coffee. And my dad knew that. He knew a homicide would be easier for us. He knew we would blame ourselves for missing the signs. He knew I would blame myself, the estranged daughter who had not called him on his birthday in 15 years, who told him she was getting married but then said, “It’s best that you don’t come.”My father was tormented by something. By what, we don’t know. Detectives were unable to find a motive. But he spent nine years obsessively searching for ways to end his life.My dad told us so much about himself in his method. He tried to protect us all. That is how he said goodbye.
5441	 1987	a	The two Pioneer spacecraft traveling far beyond the known planets have failed to find any evidence to support speculation that a 10th planet is out there somewhere, but that does not necessarily settle the matter, a space scientist reported yesterday.If there is a large planet toward the edge of the Solar System, said the scientist, John Anderson of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, it must be traveling in an elongated orbit nearly at a right angle to the orbits of the other planets. Such an orbit would bring the planet near the rest of the Solar System only every 700 to 1,000 years, he said.Dr. Anderson described this new hypothesis for the possible existence of what some astronomers have called Planet X at a news conference at the Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif. The center is directing the flights of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft, which are more than four billion miles out from the Sun on courses taking them eventually into interstellar space. Planetary PuzzleAstronomers have long searched for Planet X to account for puzzling observations showing perturbations in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune. These wobbles indicated that some large, distant object was exerting a gravitational tug on the known outer planets. The search led in 1930 to the discovery of Pluto, but it was found to be too small to be disturbing the orbits of Uranus and Neptune.
7448	 1964	a	AUSTIN, May 31—President Johnson returned to Washington from Texas tonight, having delivered two well‐received speeches in his home state and made some progress in calming one of its perennial political wars.His schedule this week includes meetings tomorrow with Prime Minister Levi Eshkol of Israel and Friday with the Shah of Iran, a speech in New London, Conn., Wednesday and another in New York Saturday.At the top of the week's events, however, will be the reports Mr. Johnson will receive from Honolulu, where top Administration officials, military officers and diplomats will meet tomorrow and Tuesday to reassess United States policy in southeast Asia, particularly Laos.Though facing a busy week, Mr. Johnson probably drew satisfaction from his three‐day weekend in Texas. He got plenty of rest, scarcely leaving his LBJ ranch 65 miles from here, and the weather was pleasant except for one round of thundershowers.

5281	 1988	a	The Bel Canto Opera, which is still locked in a struggle with Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians over collective bargaining for its occasional employees, has decided for the present to proceed with nonunion players. At the company's performance of Cavalli's ''Calisto'' Sunday afternoon at St. Bartholomew's Church, members of the Riverside Orchestra accompanied, sounding neither worse nor better than the bands assembled by this troupe in the past.But the troupe itself did better than usual. Thanks to a few promising singers in the cast and a director (Elly Stone, the cabaret singer) who knew how to have fun with the piece without either undermining its vein of seriousness or forcing the comic points, the performance surpassed expectations.Raymond Leppard's realization of Cavalli's skeletal score was used. The score of ''La Calisto'' is not a familiar one to this critic, so I cannot report at first hand the pros and cons of Mr. Leppard's edition. But one would like to have a non-Leppard ''Calisto'' locally to compare; while Mr. Leppard's realizations are loving and often beautiful, their publication and distribution does a disservice by making the doctored version more convenient to perform than the original (which means starting from scratch and making one's own realization).But the Bel Canto production was welcome in any case, first because it was, on its own terms, a good show; second because New York's last ''Calisto'' - an Opera at the Academy production - left a bad taste. Bel Canto has its own amateurish side, but the aim on this occasion was subtler and higher. Comic play with contemporary gestures and types was reserved mostly for the episodes with the drag role of the nymph Linfea (Ladd Boris, quite funny) and the satyr who pursues her (Trudy Wodzinsky, slightly tacky but effective).

3921	 1997	a	The convenience of on-line shopping has appeal from the biggest to the smallest purchases. Two of the fastest-growing categories are on-line purchases of automobiles and groceries. Though some of the initial department store efforts to sell fashion on line have been flops, some merchants are finding that they can tap into the same market that buys clothes from catalogues.''If you know how a pair of Eddie Bauer jeans fits, you don't need to go to the store to buy it,'' said Ms. Brown of America Online.It is that same quest for convenience that propelled the mail-order business over the last two decades and that is driving many people on line. Internet stores are open around the clock and are equally accessible to people around the world.''The malls are getting more and more crowded,'' said Robert Fisher, president of Gap Inc., which started selling jeans and gifts on its Web site two weeks ago. ''Customers will come on line and find an easy place to shop.'' The Gap's site re-creates some of the experience of store shopping with a computer animation section that allows users to see how various combinations of shirts, pants and shoes will look together.The peak shopping hours are late morning to early afternoon, as buyers take advantage of the faster Internet access offered on many office computers. But the Internet caters to night owls, as well. Forty percent of the purchases on America Online occur after 9 P.M.Another appeal of on-line shopping is the prospect of finding a bargain. With lower operating costs, some companies are offering significant discounts. Amazon.com Inc., the on-line bookseller, offers some titles at 40 percent off the list price. A series of searches conducted by the accounting firm Ernst & Young found that for 90 percent of a basket of gifts -- ranging from cordless drills to cameras to bunches of roses -- the Internet offers better deals than traditional stores.Yet not everyone can find all those bargains. For many, on-line shopping is filled with all the exasperation that accompanies many of the other highly promoted and imperfectly realized features of the Internet. The most frequent complaint from on-line shoppers is that finding and buying things is slow and complex. Some of that is caused by the delays inherent in Internet connections, particularly the slow speed of the modems that people use to connect from home. But many sites, shoppers say, are so poorly organized that shopping can be about as efficient as using a phone book that is not in alphabetical order.

3449	 1999	a	As an adult, Ms. Lord has kept Golf Cottage, a small, 19th-century house across a road from the nine-hole golf course on the Winterthur property. She asked her father to leave it to her instead of the large house he built to move into when the mansion became a nonprofit museum in 1951.On a low butler's table in the tiny living room was a florist's arrangement of flowers that Winterthur's publicity agent had had sent for the interview. ''I didn't get around to tearing that up,'' she said.''I like everything plain,'' she said, asked about a handful of fresh daffodils in a teacup on the windowsill. ''The furniture? It's nothing. Most of it came from Lord & Taylor.''If objects tell stories, for all of the magnificence of Winterthur, Mr. du Pont's relationship with his daughter was thinly furnished -- a man with 58 sets of china who recorded in detail his table settings for lunch and dinner for 50 years but found it hard to choose words for his children.''He almost never spoke,'' said Ms. Lord, who worked with archives at Winterthur and cases of correspondence to construct her parents' half of her childhood. ''He was a very sort of kindly person, but he was not intimate.''As is clear to a visitor, Mr. du Pont saved much of his affection for things.''After my father died, there was an Oriental rug that wound up in Connecticut, in my house, which I thought was very pretty,'' Ms. Lord said. ''One day I noticed that sewn into one of the corners, which said 'Albany' -- that was my room -- was, 'When Miss R. E. is in residence.' That was me. Ruth Ellen.'' Her father had what he considered ''an inferior rug,'' Ms. Lord said, put down when she was expected home. ''Obviously my father had a terrific distrust of children, and he thought I was going to ruin everything, so the good stuff was apparently moved out when I was there.''Golf Cottage was empty when Ms. Lord was a child at Winterthur. She went there, with her nurse, to row on the pond and catch tadpoles. As a girl, she sat inside to smoke cigarettes ''with pals,'' as she put it.

2956	 2002	a	The United States made no threat to pull out of the NATO force, in which 3,100 Americans participate. But Germany, an important member, has refused to participate unless the force has a United Nations mandate.For both Britain and France, however, the greater issue was what they perceived as a threat to the integrity of the International Criminal Court, which the European Union strongly supports as a major new instrument in international justice and human rights. Seventy-four countries have signed and ratified the treaty creating the court, whose mission will be to prosecute heinous war crimes, genocide or serious human rights abuses if the governments immediately involved refuse or are unable to do so.The court, based in The Hague, is not likely to be operational until early next year.The court is fervently opposed by conservatives in Washington as an infringement on national sovereignty, and last May the Bush administration revoked President Clinton's signature from the treaty creating the tribunal.The showdown this evening followed intense efforts at the United Nations, in Washington and in many capitals to resolve the issue.In an unusual intervention, the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, came to the Security Council to appeal for a solution that would not compromise the future of peacekeeping operations, which he administered for many years. ''The world cannot afford a situation in which the Security Council is deeply divided on such an important issue, which may have implications for all U.N. peace operations,'' he said.Mr. Negroponte declared that the United States wanted to continue contributing to peacekeeping operations, but could not without immunity from potential prosecution. ''With our global responsibilities, we are and will remain a special target and cannot have our decisions second-guessed by a court whose jurisdiction we do not recognize,'' he said.The French ambassador, Jean-David Levitte, said the American veto was ''difficult to understand in many ways.'' He and the British envoy, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, noted that American forces had operated in Bosnia despite the existence of the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, under which Americans theoretically could have been prosecuted.

4222	 1995	a	And not many people plant these trees now. They take too long to grow. "The Indians planted for three generations," Mr. Wickes said. "We plant for three weeks."But the world needs these old souls. We need something that has lived through 300 years, like the white ash in front of Tony's Lobster and Steak House in Sparkill, which has a trunk 25 feet in diameter. It is 95 feet tall, and its crown spans 75 feet. The welcome mat in front of Tony's reads, "Home of the largest white ash tree in North America." (Which is no idle boast. I called the American Forestry Association in Washington, which keeps a National Register of Big Trees, and it really is!)"It was a sapling when the pilgrims settled this area," said Janet Irizarry, who owns the restaurant with her husband, Rick.Its old limbs are knobby with a fungus called anthracnose. Its rough bark is dotted with mushrooms -- a bad sign, because mushrooms thrive on decay. But the Irizarrys coax their beloved tree along, with regular prunings, water and fertilizer. They even put ribbons around it.These old trees are like lucky people born with good genes -- who then get a couple of lucky breaks later on. Breaks like a spring trickling under the asphalt, or the Irizarrys.A group of sixth graders from the Woodglen School in New City saved the oldest white oak in the county. They were picking up old tires and pulling shopping carts out of the woods on April 22, 1970 -- the first Earth Day -- and came upon a huge white oak in an overgrown field."We felt like we were looking at something prehistoric," said Francis Stein, who was the school's principal at the time. "Like a friendly dinosaur."
2020	 2007	a	This article was written by the author last week while on tour with the Michael Gordon Band.I’m writing from Sicily, where I just arrived with my ensemble, the Michael Gordon Band. We’re playing a concert at the Etna Festival in Catania. As I’m sitting here in this beautiful Italian hotel, I’m thinking about how lucky I am to be able to travel around the world playing music. There’s no way that this could be possible without the weighty investment that most Western and Asian countries make in the arts. Those of us who perform and compose semi-popular music — that is, experimental, art, classical and jazz — cannot survive in the free market like rock, urban and country musicians do. Although there is a fan base for these more esoteric types of music that numbers in the millions, it just doesn’t add up to the large CD sales and stadium tours that the popular music stars enjoy.The arts play an extremely important role in European life. I’m not a statistician, so don’t hold me to exact numbers, but a quick search on the Web brought me this information: In the most recent study on government spending on the arts, Finland, which leads the European countries, spent about $91 per capita. (The data is summarized in a January 2000 research note by the National Endowment for the Arts.) Most European countries trail that figure by a bit, but they’re all in the same ballpark. However, the United States, the world’s greatest economic power (isn’t that what our political leaders keep telling us) spent about $6 per capita on the arts.Here in Catania, the city itself is a work of art. The streets are lined with beautiful black stone made from volcanic ash that covered the city after the great eruption of Mt. Etna in 1669. The buildings and churches were built by artisans. They are adorned with fine detail, scultpures and gardens. You might think they care about art because they live in it, whereas in the New World, where everything is built pre-fab, we don’t have the same appreciation.In Venezuela, though, they have a national music program that has 250,000 kids playing classical instruments. It’s not an enrichment program for the wealthy suburbs. Rather, it is aimed at the poor and working class. Over the past 40 years they’ve found that a 14-year-old boy in a rough neighborhood, when given a viola to play, is less likely to get into trouble and more likely to lead a productive life. The Venezuelan program provides instruments, lessons, after-school coaching and supports 200 youth orchestras. Needless to say there is no national music program here in the United States.As we find ourselves with less money for education (please, someone, explain that to me) the trend here has become to cut music in the schools. My high school in Miami, where my family moved after living in Nicaragua for 15 years, was a big, rough place with three competing ethnic groups — Latin, African-American and white. There were fights and muggings and eventually police were posted in the hallways to keep the peace. But we had a huge music program with three music teachers, and I can attest to the fact that the kids in band and orchestra, no matter what their race, all got along. It may have been dangerous out in the hallways, but inside the band room kids from Cuba, the affluent suburbs, and the inner city were playing music and having fun.Excerpt from Michael Gordon’s “Receiver,” from the CD, “Light Is Calling.” ( Excerpt from Michael Gordon’s “Receiver,” from the CD, “Light Is Calling.” ( mp3Here in Catania it was explained to me that the Etna Festival is a joint project between the cultural ministry and the tourism board. Italy, like many Western countries, has a minister of culture. I’m not expecting the mayor of the city to come to my concert, but in October 2005, when my orchestral work “Grey Pink Yellow” was premiered by the Lucerne Symphony, the mayor of Lucerne was there. In 1991 I saw the Queen of The Netherlands at the premiere of “De Materie,” a music theater work by Holland’s leading experimental composer Louis Andriessen. In Basel in 2001, I was at the opening night of European Music Month (a festival of new and experimental music) and the president of Switzerland was in attendance. And in England they knight their artists — not only former Beatles but experimental composers as well — Sir Harrison Birtwistle, Sir Michael Tippett, and more.But I’ve never seen a senator, congressman or president at a concert of experimental music in New York. Now that we’re into the political season, might one ask our leading candidates what their arts policy is?Now I know what you’re thinking. You’re thinking, “How can this guy be talking about an arts policy when we have Iraq, AIDS, global warming, and terrorism?” Well here’s my answer.There was a time when all that human beings did was hunt for food. But as we became more clever, as we learned to farm, to control fire, to build permanent dwellings, we started to concentrate not only on our physical existence but on elevating ourselves mentally and spiritually. Philosophy, art and religion became central to our identity and development as humans. Are we here in America going to revert to a permanent state of survival mode?What we remember about a culture after thousands of years is most likely to be their arts, architecture, writing and achievements in thought. Is it worth nurturing, exporting and preserving our culture? Most countries think it is. But in the United States this isn’t a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. It’s a non-issue.In February 1991 I went with my band to Estonia when it was still part of the Soviet Union. Remember all those Soviet tanks in downtown Tallinn? The state department issued a warning: No American citizens should be in the Baltic states. But I’m a musician and I wasn’t going to pass up a gig. And I had spent a year applying for grants to go. My trip was partially funded by Arts International, a now defunct project of several large foundations and, yes, the C.I.A. During the cold war the C.I.A. used to fund cultural diplomacy projects to parts of the world it considered vital to its interests.When I went to the Soviet Union, I wasn’t briefed. I wasn’t asked to do anything or say anything. I wasn’t given a mission or any instructions. (I only found out at a later date that the C.I.A. was involved.) My band and I, six Americans, were just supposed to go and play music.If there ever was a time in my life when I felt the full power of cultural diplomacy it was during my trip to Estonia. It was an extremely low point in Estonian history: The Russians had again clamped down on the country’s ongoing attempts to break away from Soviet rule. Because of the State Department warning, it seemed like we were the only Americans in the country. I could not have imagined how much having Americans — to them the symbol of hope and freedom — meant. When we arrived at the airport the director of the festival made a speech right outside of customs, welcoming us on behalf of the entire country.Our concert was packed, televised, and as we walked around Tallinn we were treated like celebrities. After our concert there was a private reception with a few dignitaries. Champagne was opened and there were more speeches and toasts in which the Estonians exclaimed what this concert meant to them. It wasn’t the music or the virtuosity of our performance they were talking about. It was simply that in a totalitarian regime having Americans present meant something.After our arrival here in Catania the local cultural emissary took my band out for dinner. As usually happens in Europe our hosts asked us how we could have elected George Bush as president. I have heard the conversation many times. We reminded them that half of the country did not vote for Bush. As members of my band tried to assuage the negative impressions these Europeans had about Americans, I thought that here a different type of cultural diplomacy was going on. There are thousands, maybe tens of thousands of American artists performing around the world — not passing through like tourists but having real, meaningful, positive interactions with the citizens of other nations. In these many small interactions, we communicate a different America.

318	 2017	a	When the United States was awarded the rights to the 1994 World Cup, the decision was greeted with similar howls by some soccer purists outside North America. There were even rumors FIFA could change its mind.But on Nov. 19, 1989, a goal by midfielder Paul Caligiuri against Trinidad and Tobago sent the United States to the 1990 World Cup — and into a new era in its soccer history. The goal was called the shot heard ’round the world, and it began a run of seven consecutive World Cup appearances.As FIFA brought its crown jewel to new continents in the decades that followed, every host avoided the ignominy of making its World Cup debut on home soil. South Korea was a regular in the tournament long before it hosted in 2002, and its co-host, Japan, made its debut in 1998. Even South Africa, the 2010 host, had been in the tournament twice before.Ahead of the April 2016 draw for the final round of qualification for Russia, Hassan al-Thawadi, the head of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, the Qatari body overseeing organization of the 2022 World Cup, stressed how vital it was that the team qualified for Russia. “It is important that we are there,” he said at the time.Yet Qatar started badly, with defeats in its first two qualifiers. With only the top two countries from the six-team group set to qualify automatically, Qatar fired its coach, the Uruguayan José Daniel Carreño, in September and replaced him with his countryman Jorge Fossati.“It is very important to go to Russia,” Fossati said ahead of his first task, a game against South Korea in October. “It is important for our players to play at the highest level as much as possible, and it is important for the confidence of the country as a football power.”

2987	 2002	a	Even in New York, it's hard to find haute couture, old Yahtzee games, rubber boots and captive plastic honey bears all in one space. Not to mention a place where all of it, except for the honey bear, is free.But past the shiny boutiques of Bedford Avenue, down Grand Street toward the water, is a storefront with a hand-painted sign reading, ''Free Store.'' It is crammed with crockery, clothes, lamps and tools, and you are welcome to walk out with anything you like.''Anything that's not chained down,'' explained Jessica Baldwin, the store's owner, if that's the right word. Six months ago, she turned the 350-square-foot area into a merchandise repository and lounging area, complete with coffee maker, boom box and guitar (all chained down). Like a giant clam, it filters the sea of excess items that flow in and out of a neighborhood.It started as a temporary project. ''People were calling it a performance store,'' Ms. Baldwin said, adding that it was based on similar stores from the 1970's. She is no retrograde, (''I wouldn't compare myself to hippies or call myself a hippie. It's 2002.''), but her store, open for anyone to hang out and play music, shares that 70's public-good ethos. Nowadays, ''there are fewer and fewer benches and pay phones,'' she said. ''Just less common space for people.''
4519	 1993	a	Agassi clawed his way back into contention after he suddenly began connecting with his bludgeonlike forehands, and he took full command in the fourth set's tie breaker. But when he dropped his serve after he lept, twirled and dropped a fancy backhand volley into the net at break point in the sixth game of the final set, he never recovered. Game Plan Rendered WorthlessOnce Enqvist held for 5-2, Agassi wilted under the pressure on his own serve: a wild backhand sent the duel to match point, and Enqvist converted it with an uncatchable forehand."We had a game plan, but if you're not sharp, it doesn't matter," said Agassi, who felt let down by his backhand and undermined by Enqvist's strong service games, which produced 20 aces and enabled him to save all but five of the 16 break points Agassi held.Agassi, whose next assignment is protecting the United States Davis Cup team from expulsion from elite competition in 1994, said he wasn't yet sure how to regroup. He's trying to adopt Segura's more thoughtful approach to competition, but is now uncertain about sabotaging his reflexes with rumination."It's a Catch-22, a big debate in my mind," Agassi said. "How much do I just rely on instincts and how much do I have a clue as to what I'm doing? Either way, I should win a match like this."Enqvist, in contrast to Agassi, has been a late bloomer. In 1991, while Agassi was battling in a final at the French Open, so too was Enqvist, who wound up the runner-up in the junior boy's competition. Enqvist was the top junior in the world that year, which also happened to be the year the 15-year-old Capriati reached the semifinals of both the French and United States Opens. Acceptance of BlameThis year Capriati had gained the quarterfinal rounds at the Australian, French and Wimbledon only to lose to Steffi Graf on each occasion. Like Agassi, she had high hopes here.
5489	 1987	a	A seasonal reminder is in order now, although I don't want to get bossy about it, hectoring people to send off their bulb orders before they draw another breath. The time to admire tulips in their great splendor is many months away, but the time to think tulips is upon us already.When I think tulips, recalling springs past, two distinct images collide in my mind. One we might call the civic tulip or the public tulip, by which I mean an overpowering display of tulips en masse, a succession of rectangular beds, each given to one cultivar only. Such a spectacle - and there's probably not an example in America seen by more people than the tulip plantings in the middle of Park Avenue - testifies with enormous force to the achievements wrought by hybridizers in Holland since the early 16th century.As Martin Rix tells it in his fascinating book, ''Growing Bulbs'' (Timber Press, 1983), when Suleiman the Magnificent reigned in Turkey, his ambassador to the court of Ferdinand I in Vienna, Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, introduced to the West the wild tulips and other bulbs that grew in the gardens of Istanbul. Interest in these flamboyant early spring flowers grew to great heights. After the strange horticultural and economic phenomenon in the 1630's known as tulipomania, when whole fortunes could be won or lost on just one bulb, the speculative bubble broke. The Dutch then got down to more sensible transactions with tulips, growing and breeding them to increase the height of their stems, the size of their flowers, and the range of their radiant colors.The result is the modern hybrid tulip. There are many classes - Darwin hybrids, cottage tulips, peony-flowered tulips and so on. So many hundreds of named cultivars are available in commerce that browsing through a bulb catalog, with its many colorful pictures of tulips , can lead to paralysis of choice. But the choice almost doesn't matter. Who has ever seen a really ugly tulip (except for those monstrosities touted for their supposed resemblance to parrots)?

1468	 2010	a	NBCJay Leno returned to “The Tonight Show” on Monday with a throwback to “The Wizard of Oz” — and maybe also to “Dallas.”In what is known as a “cold opening” — a scene before the show runs its opening credits — Mr. Leno was shown waking up in bed à la Dorothy, surrounded by his friends on the show — Kevin Eubanks, Ross the Intern and John Melendez (who has lost his job as announcer).The idea was that Jay had been away in a place where some things were wonderful and some were “not so nice,” as he put it.Of course, Mr. Leno was coming back to reoccupy the “Tonight” host chair recently vacated by Conan O’Brien, following NBC‘s retreat from its original plan for late night this season in which Mr. Leno shifted to prime time. When that didn’t work, the network decided to give Mr. Leno the 11:35 p.m. time slot back and part ways with Mr. O’Brien. Mr. Leno did not mention Mr. O’Brien in his dream sequence opening.Later he opened his monologue with the line, “It’s good to be home,” before adding, “I’m Jay Leno, your host … at least for a while.”Referencing the Super Bowl commercial in which he appeared with his rival David Letterman (and Oprah Winfrey), Mr. Leno said, “I’ve got to admit I’m a little nervous. Not because it’s my first night back. Because I know that Dave and Oprah are watching.”Mr. Letterman, on CBS, delivered only a couple of lines on Mr. Leno’s return:“Thank you very much, welcome to the ‘Late Show,’ my name is Dave Letterman — same time, same host.” “I want to tell you something, tonight is a rough night for my mom. She doesn’t know who to watch — Jimmy Kimmel or Jay.”Mr. Letterman also joked about Gov. David A. Paterson‘s problems, saying that Mr. Paterson had announced he would not run for election, but that “Jay had nothing to do with it.”Mr. Leno’s studio looked much the same as it had been on his prime time show, though he followed his monologue with a segment in which he searched for a desk. He had not sat behind a desk in prime time, which was widely noticed and criticized.

867	 2014	a	PhotoIn the outcry about the recent merger mania to take advantage of the tax avoidance transactions known as inversions, certain key players have been notably silent: public pension funds.Many of the nation’s largest public pension funds — managing trillions of dollars on behalf of police and fire departments, teachers and others — have major stakes in American companies that are seeking to renounce their corporate citizenship in order to lower their tax bill.While politicians have criticized these types of deals — President Obama has called them “wrong” and he is examining ways to end the practice — public pension funds don’t appear to be using their influence as major shareholders to encourage corporations to stay put.In the past six months, some of the nation’s largest companies have announced plans to move abroad. AbbVie, a pharmaceuticals company based in Illinois, has agreed to acquire a smaller British rival, Shire, so the combined company can relocate to Britain for tax purposes. Another drug company, Mylan, which is based outside Pittsburgh, has proposed buying the international generic drug business of Abbott Laboratories so the company can relocate to the Netherlands. Medtronic, a medical device company based in Minneapolis, has agreed to acquire Covidien of Ireland. Applied Materials has agreed to buy Tokyo Electron so it, too, can move to the Netherlands. And last week, Burger King announced it was buying Tim Hortons, the Canadian chain of coffee-and-doughnut shops, in a deal that would make Burger King a corporate citizen of Canada.The California Public Employees’ Retirement System, the nation’s largest public pension fund and typically one of the most vocal, has remained silent.“We don’t have a view on this from an investor standpoint — we’re globally invested, as you know, and appreciate that tax reform is a government role,” Anne Simpson, Calpers’s senior portfolio manager and director of global governance, told me. “We do expect companies to act with integrity, whatever the issue at hand — that goes without saying. We also want to see a focus on the long term.”When I pressed for more, her spokesman wrote to me, “We’re going to have to take a pass on this one.”Public pension funds may be so meek on the issue of inversions because they are conflicted. On one side, the funds say they care about the long term and the implications for their state. Calpers’s “Investment Beliefs” policy states that the pension system should “consider the impact of its actions on future generations of members and taxpayers,” yet most pension funds are underfunded and, frankly, desperate to show investment returns. Mergers for tax inversion can prop up share prices of the acquirers and clearly help pension funds, at least in the short term, show improved performance.Some pension managers say that their job is strictly about generating cash for pensioners and that they shouldn’t take other issues into consideration. Ash Williams, the executive director and chief investment officer of the Florida State Board of Administration, which manages more than $150 billion, explained it to me this way: “If you’re in my seat, you’re thinking about it not only as an investor, but you’re thinking about it as a fiduciary, which sort of walls out a lot of the political considerations that might otherwise be there.” He went on: “You just have to think, ‘O.K., so I’m guarding the economic interest of my beneficiary. That is my duty, and that’s the start, the middle and the end of it.’ ”When I pressed him about whether he felt he needed to consider the impact of these deals on the American tax base, which would affect pensioners, he said, “I guess I’d have to say what’s best for the company, what therefore maximizes the value of the ownership relationship I have to the company.” He added, “I mean, my gut is, as an American you’d like to keep businesses here.”Mr. Williams’s approach appears to be the norm among most investors. However, Mark Cuban, the investor and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, took to Twitter with the kind of view you’d expect from a public pension fund, not a free-market evangelist.“If I own stock in your company and you move offshore for tax reasons, I’m selling your stock,” Mr. Cuban wrote on Twitter in July. “When companies move offshore to save on taxes, you and I make up the tax shortfall elsewhere,” he said, encouraging investors to “sell those stocks and they won’t move.”Last month, Shirley K. Turner, a Democratic New Jersey state senator, introduced a novel piece of legislation in an effort to make inversion deals less attractive. She proposed that the state’s pension board be forbidden to invest in companies that are involved in inversion deals. She said the state of New Jersey “ranks sixth among public pension funds investing in corporate inverter AbbVie, holding more than 1.5 million shares of the company’s common stock, valued at $81.9 million.”It is unclear how such legislation would work. For example, would the state immediately be forced to sell its holdings in a company involved an inversion?Not all officials who oversee pension funds are focused only on the immediate bottom line.“Our fiduciary duty to our members is to vote our economic interest — and that means making an individualized determination of whether a given transaction is in our best interests as long-term share owners,” said Scott M. Stringer, the New York City comptroller. “As a result, we don’t merely look at the offer price on the day of closing but instead take into consideration everything from potential influence on shareholder rights to whether a merger places short-term gain over long-term growth.” Still, as Pfizer, one of the largest companies in New York, has continued to contemplate a merger with AstraZeneca that would make the combined corporation a British entity, neither Mr. Stringer nor any other investor acting on behalf of pensioners has spoken out. Perhaps not surprisingly, the only people who appear to be concerned are a small but growing group of politicians in Washington.After Burger King announced its deal with Tim Hortons, Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, declared, “If this merger goes through, there could well be a strong public reaction against Burger King that could more than offset any tax benefit it receives from a tax avoidance move,” suggesting customers take up the cause.Indeed, the Walgreen Company, which had been considering a tax inversion transaction with Alliance Boots of Britain, voted against changing its corporate citizenship because the American pharmacy chain’s board and management worried about an outcry from customers, according to people close to the board, and were concerned that pressure from customers could spill over to the government.Where are the investors? Happily watching their returns rise. When I asked Mr. Williams, the Florida pension manager, what he would do if he had to vote on a deal involving a Florida company pursuing an inversion that would hurt the state’s tax base, he sighed and said: “This issue is new enough — and fortunately, at this point, it’s small enough — that it hadn’t reached those dimensions. And I would just hope that we can get something done at the policy level to resolve it. That’s the best outcome.”

4855	 1991	a	Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, who was the Democratic Presidential nominee in 1984, said of his party's field for 1992: "Most of them will believe that running for President is simply an extension of running for Governor or Senator. Actually, it's entirely different. It's the vastness of the country, the differences, the demands of people and the sheer exhaustion of it all." A Narrow World View?Democrats are particularly sensitive to the dangers of insular campaigns after their experience in 1988: The campaign of Gov. Dukakis stayed Boston-and-Cambridge-bound until the end, and its strategic decisions, in the view of many Democrats, reflected its narrow world view. Some political professionals wonder if Mr. Cuomo carries the seeds of a similar clannishness."Around any candidate, the question is how does he arrive at his decisions, who helps make the decisions, what's the team that decides," said Ann F. Lewis, a longtime Democratic strategist. "The early impression of Mario Cuomo is this has been a very small team of people who have known him a long time."The experience of other Presidential campaigns suggests that kind of team can take you through a couple of early primaries, but you can't run a national campaign that way," Ms. Lewis added. "The question of field operatives will be, do they have the capacity to grow? Can you trust, delegate, empower people to act on behalf of your campaign nationally?"Jody Powell, the former press secretary to Jimmy Carter, who faced a similar task in melding outsiders into a home state campaign, was tactful. "If you're the Governor of Georgia, you're probably inclined to know that you don't know everything," said Mr. Powell, now a public relations executive in Washington. "I'm not saying this particularly about Mario, but being governor of a big state like New York or California, maybe you don't get quite enough of a sense that you need to learn some things about the rest of the country." Still, Mr. Powell noted that Mr. Cuomo had traveled the country over the years. 'Suspicious' New YorkersAnother Democratic strategist, a veteran of Presidential politics who spoke on condition that he not be identified, said, "Traditionally, New York State Democrats are provincial in their view of talent: They're the fast lane, they're the Big Apple. It's a very tough style and a very suspicious style and it assumes that everyone has some other agenda."But John Marino, the New York Democratic chairman who is a Cuomo ally, asserted that Mr. Cuomo has faced these kinds of charges before, and had shown in his 1982 campaign for governor how he can expand his base. "The fact of the matter is people all across the state joined together to elect him, and if this ever happened on a national level, we'd get a lot of help from people in different places," Mr. Marino said. "And we'd want it and welcome it."

5242	 1988	a	Precious metals futures soared yesterday after a dramatic late rally caused frenzied buying among the large number of traders who had been betting on a decline in the prices of gold, silver and especially platinum in recent weeks.Indeed, platinum was the catalyst that touched off the turnabout, with the active nearby deliveries soaring the daily permissible limit on the New York Mercantile Exchange.At the close, the unrestricted spot March platinum futures were up $25.30 an ounce, to $475, while the more active April delivery rose the daily limit of $25, also to $475.Experts said the late surge in platinum largely reflected rising concern about the political situation in South Africa, a major producer of the metal.

336	 2017	a	Luis Olmo, who became the first Puerto Rican position player in the major leagues when he made his debut with the 1943 Brooklyn Dodgers, helping to create a path for the dozens of Puerto Rican ballplayers who have made a major impact on the game, died on Friday in Santurce, P.R. He was 97 and had been the oldest living former Dodger.His death was confirmed by a grandson, Yuri Perez.Olmo, who played mostly in the outfield, arrived at Ebbets Field a year after Hiram Bithorn, a right-handed pitcher, became the first Puerto Rican major leaguer when he joined the Chicago Cubs.Cubans had appeared in the majors before Bithorn and Olmo arrived. Whatever their nationality, all of the early Latino players possessed a qualification that ownership demanded: They were white.Latinos began making a significant impact in American baseball only after Jackie Robinson broke the modern major league color barrier with the 1947 Dodgers.

4774	 1991	a	Merchandise creditors of Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores reacted with general approval yesterday to the companies' reorganization plan because they would get the biggest share -- about $513 million -- of the $850 million in cash to be offered.But they said that many problems in the plan, which was filed on Monday, must be resolved before they could give formal consent. A Federal judge cannot allow Federated and Allied to emerge from voluntary bankruptcy until at least 50 percent of each class of creditor, representing at least two-thirds of the class's debt, has approved the plan.Federated and Allied filed for bankruptcy in January 1990. The Campeau Corporation acquired Federated in 1988 and Allied in 1986. The debt taken on in connection with the two acquisitions forced Federated and Allied into bankruptcy. The Remaining $337 MillionThe remaining $337 million in cash would be distributed to other unsecured creditors, as well as to secured creditors, including banks and some premerger bondholders, along with notes and stock. Other bondholders, however, would be offered only stock in a new company, Federated Department Stores, which would emerge early next year as a combination of Federated and Allied's 244 department stores.

2785	 2003	a	''If it was the 99th year or the 101st year, it would still be the most important thing of the year for me,'' he said. ''The centennial doesn't change the importance for the team or for me as an athlete.''Armstrong seems to be facing a far broader array of opponents than usual. They include Jan Ullrich, 29, a German who twice finished second to Armstrong; Joseba Beloki, 29, a Spaniard, once second, twice third; Santiago Botero, 30, a Colombian who was fourth last year and won the first long time trial, with Armstrong second; Levi Leipheimer, 29, an American who was eighth last year; and Christophe Moreau, 32, a Frenchman who was nowhere last year after a series of crashes forced him to retire from the race.Armstrong has dominated them all before and they may be intimidated by him. Intimidated riders tend to shoot for an attainable second or third place, not first.Somewhat in the same state is Tyler Hamilton, 32, an American who helped Armstrong win three Tours as part of the Postal Service team. Hamilton joined the CSC team from Denmark last year, finished second in the Giro d'Italia despite a broken shoulder and then 15th in the Tour while still injured.A strong climber and time-trialer, Hamilton nevertheless may not be able to overcome his respect for Armstrong to become a true rival.These are all men in or close to their 30's, like Armstrong, who turns 32 in September. What of the younger riders? At the top of the class are two Spaniards, Iban Mayo, 25, and Francisco Mancebo, 27, each coming off a strong spring. A tad older is Aitor Gonzalez, 28, another Spaniard and winner of the last Vuelta a España.Armstrong cited not one rider but a team, Telekom from Germany, as a threat.''Savoldelli, Botero, Vinokourov, Nardello,'' he said. ''Put 'em all together and they can be tough. I don't think any one of them is a potential winner, but if you gave them a 15-minute breakaway, then they are potential winners.''

2149	 2007	a	These are tumultuous times for flamboyant developer Donald Trump.First the Wall Street Journal printed a detailed article suggesting The Donald’s name has been “tarnished” by the lackadaisical results posted by several projects carrying his name. “Even the Trump name isn’t bigger than the calamitous condo market,” concluded the WSJ article, which focused on Florida properties.Trump TrumpThat prompted an angry response from Trump, who described the article as “one of the most ridiculous I have read in many years.” (Subscription required to read full letter.)Now he’s embroiled in a controversy in Scotland over his attempt to build a €1.4 billion seaside golf resort, including two golf courses, a luxury hotel and about 1,500 homes north of Aberdeen. In a setback for Trump, the local town council rejected the plan as out of scale with the area. Mr. Trump was “shocked” a spokesman told the Associated Press.But Trump’s fans are fighting back and an emergency meeting has been called, as detailed in this story in the Financial Times.Meanwhile, in a front page story, the Aberdeen Evening Express labeled the councilors who voted against the project, “You Traitors.”In an interview with the paper, Trump said he felt he had let down his late mother—who was Scottish—in failing to win approval for the project.

3779	 1997	a	The competitive revolution in telecommunication took two encouraging steps forward this week. News Corporation announced a merger that promises to provide its customers with a broadcast satellite service fully equal, if not superior, to their local cable service. AT&T, the long-distance carrier, then announced that it had secretly developed a technology that would allow it to bring local phone service to people's homes without using the equipment of the regional Bell companies.The key in both cases is wireless communication. News Corporation, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, and AT&T are threatening to break the monopoly choke hold of their competitors by sending their services over the air, rather than laying fabulously expensive wires into everyone's home.News Corporation will invest $1 billion in a new service with Echostar Communications, a small satellite broadcaster. The combined facilities will offer homes across most of the country a video service that includes hundreds of channels of high-resolution TV, C.D.-quality sound and something that no other satellite service has so far been able to provide -- signals from at least some local television stations. Because satellite services have lacked local channels, they have lured too few cable customers to keep cable rates down. By offering satellite customers local channels, News Corporation will give households the option of saying goodbye to their local cable monopolies.AT&T also plans to bring its service into the home over the air rather than through a wire. The wireless technology will broadcast phone calls from towers directly to a radio box attached to the home. From there, the call will travel through phone lines and equipment that already exist in everyone's home.

3843	 1997	a	The Energy Department said today that it planned to carry out the first in a series of nuclear weapons experiments intended to assure the safety of the United States' aging nuclear arsenal. Department officials said the tests would not violate the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.Some environmental and arms-control organizations have tried to stop the tests, which begin Wednesday, arguing that they are inconsistent with a post-cold-war policy of reducing the nuclear arms threat. But the Government maintains that the tests, in which scientists at the Nevada Test Site will set off high-powered explosives to measure their effect on plutonium, are needed to learn how to assure the reliability of aging nuclear weapons by some means other than blowing them up. The experiments are allowed, the department argues, because no nuclear reaction will occur.The experiments ''are essential to the United States' commitment to a world free of nuclear testing while maintaining a reliable nuclear deterrent,'' the department said.But six prominent arms-control experts released a letter today to the White House, the Energy Department and the Pentagon asking for international inspections to demonstrate that the tests were non-nuclear.

2285	 2006	a	Good tennis matches have ebb and flow. On Court 10, under gray skies and a stiff breeze, the Czech Tomas Berdych, the No. 12 seed, faces Florian Mayer, a German player, world No. 58.Mayer is a slender 6-3. Berdych, at 6-5, has a improbable height advantage and a blistering serve in his favor. Berdych takes the first set, 6-1. But he drops the second, 3-6, and gives up a break in the third set at 2 all. He’s on the ropes.Then the momentum shifts. Berdych’s entourage, courtside in the low stands across from his chair, barks encouragement and maybe some advice in Czech. Berdych stiffens, focuses. He suddenly breaks back, then runs out the set, 6-3. Now it’s Mayer who looks helpless, dejected, forced onto his heels point after point, unable to slug it out — or vary it up.Untouchable on serve, Berdych misses chances in several games to force break points at 0-30 or 15-30. But it’s clearly a matter of when.It happens at 2-2. At this point, Berdych blasts everything into the corners. When Mayer mounts a last charge, he’s behind 5-2. It’s too little, too late.Afterward, he tells me he’s unable to beat Berdych when Berdych is on. From Federer down, the men are remarkably honest about themselves and each other. It’s true, Mayer says, he should have come to net sooner, but it would not have changed the outcome.The arc of the match is classic drama. The winner’s triumph is heightened by his teetering on defeat. And, in Mayer’s case, vice versa.

3934	 1996	a	The 29-year-old Richter, who missed a month of action after tearing a thigh muscle in January 1992, has won five consecutive games. He is 11-1-2 in his last 14 outings and was brilliant again Saturday night, stopping 33 of 36 shots. He made several terrific saves early against Edmonton that altered the tempo of the game. The Rangers, buoyed by Richter, turned their offense loose and took a 5-0 lead against Edmonton goalie Bill Ranford before the first period was over.Richter has been the backbone to the Rangers' ascension this month, often protecting a narrow lead when his teammates tired. And tired they often were because the Rangers tonight played their 17th game of the month, a team record. Despite the ambitious schedule, the Rangers were 11-2-3 in December going into tonight's game and had moved to the top of the N.H.L. with a 25-10-6 record, good for 56 points.But the grind is starting to show, and as the month wound down, the rope the Rangers have been pulling was looking a bit frayed. In addition to Richter, the Rangers lost defenseman Mattias Norstrom for at least six weeks after he separated his right shoulder in the first period Saturday night.Norstrom was injured during a pileup in front of the net. He was knocked over by Edmonton's Jason Arnott."I got pushed over, and I didn't have time to catch my fall," said Norstrom, whose arm was placed in a sling. "I landed half on my shoulder, half on my head."It's too bad when I started to play a little bit," added Norstrom, who had been scratched from the previous three games and seven of the previous nine. "It's tough luck. Hopefully it will not be five or six weeks."Last week, defenseman Ulf Samuelsson underwent arthroscopic surgery to have chips removed from his left elbow. He may miss another week. Another defenseman, Doug Lidster, missed Saturday night's game with the flu, which forced the Rangers to rotate just five defensemen after Norstrom left. With Samuelsson and Norstrom both sidelined, the backup defenseman Aleksandr Karpovtsev will probably see much more action. Karpovtsev had played sparingly this season but did well Saturday night.
2543	 2004	a	HIGHLIGHTSNAGANO TO MONTREAL? -- Kent Nagano, left, is set to succeed Charles Dutoit as music director of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, a report in Le Devoir, a Montreal newspaper, said. The appointment of Mr. Nagano, the artistic director and principal conductor of the Deutsches Sinfonie-Orchester Berlin, principal conductor of the Los Angeles Opera, music director of the Berkeley Symphony Orchestra in California since 1978 and designated successor in 2006 to Zubin Mehta as music director of the Bavarian State Opera, would begin with the 2006-7 season. The Montreal Symphony would not comment on the report but said it would announce a successor to Mr. Dutoit this month. The post of music director of the Montreal Symphony has been vacant since spring 2002, when Mr. Dutoit, who had held the position for 25 years, resigned abruptly after the Quebec Musicians Guild issued an open letter likening the musicians under him to battered spouses who ''have quietly endured years of verbal and psychological abuse and now want it to stop.''KNIGHTHOOD FOR PERAHIA -- The American pianist Murray Perahia is to be made an honorary knight commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in a ceremony in London next Monday. Because Mr. Perahia is not a British citizen, the knighthood, for his service to music, is honorary, The Associated Press reported. Foreign Secretary Jack Straw cited Mr. Perahia's work with the Aldeburgh Festival in eastern England, which led to a collaboration with the composer Benjamin Britten and the singer Peter Pears and Mr. Perahia's appearances as principal guest conductor of the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields.ARTS AND LETTERS HONORS -- The artists Lee Bontecou and Lester Johnson; the writers Jamaica Kincaid, left, Isabel Allende, Paula Fox, James Tate and Lanford Wilson, and the composers Robert Beaser and Bernard Rands have been elected to membership in the American Academy of Arts and Letters. They will be inducted by its secretary, the poet Robert Pinsky, at the academy's annual ceremonial in May.McCARTNEY ON TOUR -- Paul McCartney will cap a 13-date European tour by making his first appearance at the Glastonbury music festival, Britain's biggest open-air music event, on June 26, the middle day of the three-day spectacular, Reuters reported.

1857	 2008	a	Democrats may have a reputation for being the “mommy party,” but according to a survey of restructuring professionals, Senator John McCain is the presidential candidate most likely to create a nurturing environment for turning around distressed companies.That’s among the findings in a survey by AlixPartners, a business advisory firm that does brisk business in restructuring. As part of the firm’s second annual AlixPartners Risk Factor Index, the firm surveyed 44 bankruptcy lawyers, bankers, fund managers and others.According to the survey, 78 percent of these individuals think Mr. McCain, the all-but-certain Republican nominee for president, would most aid the work of those in the restructuring industry. On this question, the two candidates for the Democratic nomination, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, earned just 11 percent each.Mr. McCain has sometimes spoken candidly of the troubles facing parts of the American economy, most notably the auto industry. In the days before Michigan’s Republican primary in January, the senator from Arizona told audiences that many of the state’s auto-making jobs probably wouldn’t come back, a sentiment that Mitt Romney, his opponent at the time, deemed “defeatist.”But no matter who is in office, respondents appear to think the federal government will intervene in the financial markets. About 74 percent of those surveyed expressed that view, citing the role taken by the Treasury department and the Federal Reserve in arranging Bear Stearns‘s sale to JPMorgan Chase.What’s not in dispute is that these individuals expect to be busy. About 98 percent of respondents said a “big spike” in restructuring incidents is looming, and 65 percent said it would likely to come by this winter. (About 30 percent said it would arrive by this fall.)Go to AlixPartners Press Release via BusinessWire »
702	 2015	a	“Is it really possible to be bored by the end of the world?” the author Naomi Klein asks at the beginning of “This Changes Everything,” a climate-change documentary inspired by Ms. Klein’s 2014 book of the same name. Her question, as it turns out, is an unfortunate opener for a film that tries too hard to find comfort in crisis and hope in destruction.Viewers, then, might be forgiven a wave of ennui as they watch familiar images of cracking earth and crumbling glaciers, as well as beleaguered citizens preparing to be trampled by the relentless march of the fossil-fuel giants. The tone is not improved by Ms. Klein’s super-sweet narration, which, in trying to avoid hectoring, too often coats complex issues in a deceptive simplicity.But Ms. Klein can hardly be blamed for the difficulty of condensing her prodigious and wide-ranging research into 89 minutes. Nor can the director, Avi Lewis (who spent four years filming in nine countries), be chastised for highlighting the uplift that Ms. Klein finds as she pokes around the globe. It’s not easy to describe a systemic plundering of resources, and identify the culprit as global capitalism, without losing your train of thought or your cool, and the movie accomplishes this by focusing on the cheering reactions of the victims — in this case, a bottom-up environmentalism of regular folks fighting irregular circumstances.And these so-called pollution mutinies are everywhere, organized by those who stand directly in the path of free-market exploitation. The young owners of a Montana goat ranch battle a ruptured Exxon pipeline; poor Indians use their bodies to obstruct the building of power plants on life-giving wetlands; an indigenous group in Canada rebels against toxic spills on ancestral lands. Their stories give the film its heart, and sometimes pierce our own; yet its embrace is so wide — including questioning the role of government and identifying pollution’s beneficiaries — that depth is a primary casualty.
6029	 1978	a	ATLANTA, May 1—As part of President Carter's plan for “Voluntary” control of inflation; the Administration is prepared to subpoena corporate records and publicly criticize companies that do not hold down prices, the director of the Council on Wage and Price Stability said here today.The director. Barry F. Bosworth, also said that the Administration would press business executives to hold their salary increases to 5 percent and would ask “high visibility unions” to accept much smaller increases in new contracts.Mr. Bosworth, who was speaking at a luncheon at the annual convention of the American Newspaper Publishers’ As- sociation, said that doctors, dentists, lawyers and other professional groups would also be called upon “in the very near future” to hold down increases in their fees.The speech by the 35-year-old econo mist was one of the bluntest by a high official since thd start of the Administration's effort to limit inflation by exhortation rather than through wage and price controls.

1404	 2011	a	In this edition: upheaval in the Republican presidential nomination contest, an old foe returns, college football chaos and baseball collapses.ReactionsThe Republican nominating process has been dominated recently by rekindled interest in Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey. Republican donors and luminaries have been trying to coax him into the ring, so FiveThirtyEight explored whether the prospect of Candidate Christie should more unnerve Gov. Rick Perry of Texas or Mitt Romney.The New Republic’s Jonathan Cohn examined the origins of surging interest in Mr. Christie specifically, but also the well-worn phenomenon of “savior candidates.” Mr. Cohn wisely observed that “in modern politics, ‘savior’ candidates are never again as popular as they are the day before they announce.”But lest Mr. Christie’s admirers get too feverish, The San Francisco Chronicle has a Bloomberg roundup of the (many, many) times Mr. Christie has said he will not run.One reason attention turned to Mr. Christie was Mr. Perry’s somewhat abysmal debate performance. FiveThirtyEight noted the subsequent sagging in Mr. Perry’s favorability and horse-race numbers. Slate’s John Dickerson, in a walk-through of Mr. Perry’s debate missteps, argued that the mistakes were particularly damaging because they undercut the heart of the case Mr. Perry was making to the Republican primary electorate, that, as Mr. Dickerson wrote, “Perry is one of you — he prays, he speaks plainly, he’s from a small town in Texas — and Moneybags Mitt ain’t.”At Outside the Beltway, Doug Mataconis took a step back and challenged the importance placed on presidential debate performances in the first place.Another upshot of the emerging unhappiness with Mr. Perry was renewed interest in Herman Cain. Way back in May, FiveThirtyEight outlined several reasons for taking Mr. Cain’s campaign seriously. Mr. Cain’s national poll numbers proceeded to rise, then fall and now they are up again.Well, The Wall Street Journal seemed to have taken notice. The Journal’s columnist Daniel Henninger, in an column headlined “Taking Cain Seriously,” argued that Mr. Cain’s business-heavy, politics-lite resume — not typical for a White House aspirant — should be a plus in voters’ minds, not a negative.Salon’s Steve Kornacki, however, took the resurgence of Mr. Cain, as well as Newt Gingrich, another way. Mr. Kornacki wrote that the improved outlook for the two candidates “may be the surest sign yet of Rick Perry’s failure to meet his potential.”In The American Thinker, John Zeigler took issue with FiveThirtyEight’s analysis of the Pennsylvania G.O.P.’s plan to remake how the state apportions its electoral votes. (Mr. Zeigler and FiveThirtyEight have had previous disagreements).Leaving politics, Nate’s analysis of college football fandom and its implications for conference realignment — which appeared at The Quad — drew a mixed review from On the Banks, a blog focused on Rutgers football.FiveThirtyEight performed a preemptive autopsy on the Boston Red Sox late-season crack-up, and then dissected its final, heart-breaking (or uplifting, depending on your loyalties) chapter. The Financial Times’ blog, Alphaville, published an interesting article explaining how Boston’s collapse illuminates another breakdown — the 2008 financial free-fall.And finally, our Comment-of-the-Half-Month goes to… Chrislav from New York City. In a not strictly on-topic response to “Bill Buckner Strikes Again,” she advised single women to go see “Moneyball,” and not just for Brad Pitt. The movie, Chrislav wrote, “attracts smart men, not so much the shoot ’em up car-crash gun fightin’ type, but thoughtful, sensitive, baseball-loving men.” She concludes:So girls — you say you don’t know where to meet great guys? I say put your best dress on, call up your girlfriends, head for the local movie theater playing “Moneyball,” get there early, make a few trips to the concession stand to scout out the audience, and your chance of meeting that special guy there are way better than your chances of meeting one in a bar.Thank you to the cupid-inclined Chrislav (unless you secretly work for Sony Pictures Entertainment).ReadsAt The Monkey Cage, Erica Chenoweth wrote an insightful article about terrorism and democracy.A National Journal article by Ronald Brownstein and Scott Bland unpacks new census data and finds “the Great Recession and its aftermath have battered virtually every state in the nation—and that some of the heaviest blows have landed on states that may loom the largest in the 2012 presidential election.”Ezra Klein, at The Washington Post, highlighted research that studied the uncertainty argument, which holds that the threat of new taxes and regulations is the root of the tepid economic picture.Bill Adair, at PolitiFact, whose data FiveThirtyEight delved into recently, looked at the Truth-O-Meter ratings amassed by political pundits.And — although not technically a read — our very own Nate Silver was interviewed by Howard Kurtz for his CNN show “Reliable Sources.” Here is Part 1 and Part 2 of the video.

3198	 2001	a	The three biggest television networks -- ABC, CBS and NBC -- filed a copyright infringement lawsuit yesterday against the maker of a digital device that functions much like a videocassette recorder. The complaint was filed in the Federal District Court for Central California against ReplayTV Inc. and its corporate parent, Sonicblue Inc. ReplayTV makes a device much like the better-known TiVo unit that records television programs on a big hard disk. ReplayTV, however, recently introduced a new version of its machine that allows users to set it to skip advertisements and to transmit recorded programs to other people over the Internet. An intriguing aspect of the lawsuit is that NBC, which is a unit of the General Electric Company, is an investor in ReplayTV, as is the Walt Disney Company, which also owns ABC. CBS is owned by Viacom Inc. Seth Schiesel (NYT)

4729	 1991	a	George Bush begins the new year with his Presidency poised between success and failure. The country begins it with bated breath.Should the crisis in the Middle East turn into a blood bath, or become the kind of prolonged stalemate that Mr. Bush has promised to avoid, it could prove as damaging to him as Vietnam proved to Lyndon B. Johnson. If weeks or months of heavy American casualties would hurt, so would further disruption of oil supplies, which would force up gasoline prices and damage the already weak economy.Like Lyndon Johnson, President Bush could find it devilishly hard to deliver either of the two things that matter most to the American electorate -- peace and prosperity. That's why the next few months, in the plain words of Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, look like "make or break time for George Bush."The prospect of another crippled President, one would think, would cast a pall over Washington, to say nothing of the prospect of war. But no real anxiety grips the capital. In fact, the most notable things about the city as the final hours of 1990 slipped by were empty sidewalks, silent telephones and offices vacated hours before quitting time.
1106	 2012	a	National signing day has turned into a made-for-television affair, with recruits selecting their universities’ caps before crowds of friends and family members and an audience at home. The 2012 version of this annual rite yielded a few additional themes.The strong recruiting classes signed by Ohio State and Miami on Wednesday showed that prospects are willing to overlook N.C.A.A. sanctions (or the threat of penalties, in Miami’s case) if the coach can sell the program.Alabama, the national champion, hauled in what was regarded as the nation’s best class. Texas, Florida, Florida State and Michigan were among the other top finishers, recruiting experts said.Although recruits might overlook sanctions, they were much less forgiving of the off-field issues at Penn State, where the impact of the child sexual-abuse scandal involving the former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky was felt in a recruiting class that came undone.Here is a closer look at some of signing day’s winners and losers.WinnersOHIO STATE Urban Meyer was able to turn other programs’ misfortune into good fortune for the Buckeyes. A little more than two months after taking over as the Ohio State coach, Meyer attracted one of the nation’s best classes.“He’s a great counterpuncher,” said Tom Lemming, a recruiting analyst for CBS Sports. “He took four recruits from Penn State, one from Notre Dame and one from Michigan State. He took advantage of others teams’ problems and did what he does best: recruit.”Among the top recruits to sign with Ohio State were the prized defensive end Noah Spence, who once favored Penn State, and the 300-pound defensive tackle Tommy Schutt, who switched his commitment from Penn State.Ohio State was also able to scoop up many top in-state prospects, even though the program was put on N.C.A.A. probation in December.Valerie Mosley/The News-Leader, via Associated PressMISSOURI The Tigers signed this year’s consensus best player: receiver Dorial Green-Beckham, who played in high school in nearby Springfield, Mo. Green-Beckham is a needed pickup for Coach Gary Pinkel as Missouri prepares to enter the Southeastern Conference this fall. At 6 feet 6 inches, Green-Beckham has been likened to Randy Moss, and he reportedly caught 119 passes for 2,233 yards and 24 touchdowns during his senior year.MIAMI Despite the threat of sanctions against his program, Al Golden was able to lure top players to Miami while also keeping many of the elite local prospects at home. Golden has done particularly well in talent-rich Miami-Dade and Broward Counties, recruiting the elite defensive back Tracy Howard of Miramar, Fla., who chose Miami rather than Florida or Florida State.LosersPENN STATE A brutal signing day was the latest fallout from the scandal that led to the firing of Joe Paterno as coach. The Nittany Lions were poised to haul in one of the nation’s best classes. But after the scandal broke in November, they saw an exodus of top prospects that continued all the way up until Wednesday, when the Philadelphia quarterback Skyler Mornhinweg signed with Florida. Several other top recruits switched their commitments to Ohio State.What further damaged Penn State was its protracted coaching search and the inability of its new coach, Bill O’Brien, to devote time to keeping the class intact. O’Brien has continued to serve as the offensive coordinator for the New England Patriots, who play in the Super Bowl on Sunday.“If O’Brien had been recruiting all January, he would have been able to save some of the guys,” Lemming said. “But him being away from State College hurt them.”CALIFORNIA A poor signing-day performance for California illustrated the importance of one deft assistant coach. The Golden Bears’ promising class fell to pieces after Tosh Lupoi, one of the nation’s top recruiters, left in January to become a defensive coach at Washington.Three potential gems of Cal’s class — safety Shaq Thompson, defensive tackle Ellis McCarthy and receiver Jordan Payton — switched their commitments after Lupoi left. McCarthy and Payton signed with U.C.L.A. Thompson signed with Washington.“It shows you he’s a bit of a pied piper,” Lemming said of Lupoi. “He’s the best recruiter in the country as far as assistants go. They had one of the best classes in the country, but they’ve been dropping rapidly.”LOUISIANA STATE L.S.U. was unable to parlay its trip to the national title game into a strong signing day. The Tigers failed to attract many top in-state prospects, with Alabama and other programs invading and plundering elite talent.

1680	 2009	a	After taking a tongue lashing from President Obama, Chrysler’s holdout lenders got a show of support from The Financial Times’s John Gapper.“Unlike Barack Obama and others, I have sympathy for the hedge funds and other investment funds that rejected the Chrysler restructuring offer and forced it into Chapter 11 bankruptcy,” Mr. Gapper wrote in a column titled “In defence of the Chrysler hedge funds.”On Thursday, Mr. Obama railed against the holdout lenders, now effectively a hostile group of business partners, whom he called “speculators.”“They were hoping that everybody else would make sacrifices, and they would have to make none,” Mr. Obama said of the creditors, among them several hedge funds and boutique investment funds. “I don’t stand with them.”Most of the major debtholders, led by JPMorgan Chase, agreed to write down the debt owed to them by more than two-thirds. That put the onus on the remaining holdouts — including units of OppenheimerFunds, Xerion Capital Fund of Perella Weinberg Partners and Stairway Capital — which argued they were falling victim to the willingness of their big banking partners in Chrysler to play nice with a government that had helped bail them out as well. Perella Weinberg decided late Thursday that it would accept the government’s terms.Administration officials said the holdouts’ position left them no option but to force Chrysler into bankruptcy.“Well, yes,” Mr. Gapper wrote, “except that some of these ‘speculators’ inconveniently manage money on behalf of pension plans and endowments, rather than rapacious rich people. They have a fiduciary duty to get the best deal they can on behalf of their investors.”“I also take seriously their point that, although they are higher up in the ranks of creditors than Chrysler’s unions, notably the UAW, they were offered less for their investments,” Mr. Gapper added.The secured lenders, contending that they are being unfairly blamed for sending the automaker into bankruptcy protection, say that the Obama administration is skirting bankruptcy law by forcing them to take a larger loss on their debt than other Chrysler stakeholders.The group, which is calling itself the Committee of Non-TARP Lenders, said Thursday that it had been compelled to negotiate through a group of big banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, that have accepted government bailout money and so are reluctant to push back against the Treasury Department’s proposal. They claim the government has ignored their proposals to restructure Chrysler.Mr. Gapper agreed with that assessment, writing: “President Obama is trying to use the bully pulpit of the presidency to shove these investors into taking a worse deal than they could ordinarily expect under Chapter 11. The Tarp-funded banks that voted for the deal were no doubt aware of how they might be pilloried if they did not do so.”However, not all industry watchers were feeling the love for the holdout lenders. The Washington Post’s Steven Pearlstein took them to task in a broad swipe at the hedge fund industry.“There may be nothing more pathetic than a hedge-fund manager worked up in a moral lather, complaining that he hasn’t been treated fairly. Since when did any of these guys ever worry about fairness?” Mr. Pearlstein wrote.The columnist said he didn’t “recall receiving even a single e-mail from a hedge-fund manager complaining about how unfair it was that the government stepped in to bail out creditors and counterparties of Citigroup, Bear Stearns and AIG.”In an editorial on the Chrysler bankruptcy, The New York Times said that by pushing the matter into bankruptcy court, the administration was assuming that the judge would also reject the holdouts’ demands.“There are reasons to hope it will work out that way. In particular, a judge may be unwilling to favor the dissident bondholders when other significant stakeholders have been able to come to agreement outside of court,” The New York Times said.Bankruptcy always contains some element of unpredictability, and the minority of debtholders who oppose the new arrangement could argue in court that the company is worth more to them in liquidation. Mr. Gapper argued that the holdout creditors may even “have a better chance of getting improved terms from the bankruptcy court than the US administration would have us believe.”Go to Article from The Financial Times »Go to Article from The Washington Post »Go to Item from DealBook »Go to Editorial from The New York Times »Go to Related Article from The New York Times »

4699	 1992	a	For Ben Feder, the Clinton campaign has been a bonanza. Mr. Feder is a pioneer Hudson Valley vintner. Since 1977, he has made a crisp, dry white wine from the seyval blanc grape. Mr. Feder's estate is in Clinton Corners, N.Y., and his label says Clinton Vineyards.By late October, Mr. Feder usually has 700 cases of vintage-dated still wine in stock and 150 of nonvintage sparkling wine. But today his inventory has shrunk to 95 and 25, respectively. With the election approaching, Democrats, thirsty for more than the White House, have rung the winery's phone off the hook.He could have sold every bottle during the Democratic Convention. But he kept some, just in case Clinton headquarters called from Little Rock. "If there's an inauguration, I'll need 750 to 1,000 cases, " he said. "I'm beating my brains out trying to figure out what to do."Mr. Feder's 1991 vintage was the best since 1984. With one eye, he is watching his 1992 seyval evolve in tanks. With the other, he's watching the tightening polls, and wondering if the bubbles in the Democrats' champagne will go flat Tuesday night.
4331	 1994	a	A drug commonly given to transplant patients offers the first new treatment in 40 years for victims of severe ulcerative colitis and can often spare them removal of their colons, a study has found.Ulcerative colitis is a chronic bowel inflammation that results in bloody diarrhea and other symptoms. When steroids fail to stop the disease in a severe case, doctors almost always have to remove the patient's colon.The study showed that the transplant drug, cyclosporine, was effective in people with severe ulcerative colitis who had not responded to steroid drugs, the last medicine introduced for severe forms of the disease.The study, led by Dr. Simon Lichtiger and conducted at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and the University of Chicago, is being published on Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine.
5057	 1989	a	ALTHOUGH he has two successful restaurants to his credit, Pino Luongo maintains that the best Italian cooking is found at home.This former actor - he is the owner of Sapore di Mare, which opened in Wainscott last May, and the creator of the acclaimed Cantinori in Manhattan - has just written ''A Tuscan in the Kitchen'' (Clarkson N. Potter Inc., $24.95) to prove his point.''The inspiration for a good Tuscan restaurant is home cooking,'' Mr. Luongo says in the introduction to his book. The foods that he knew from childhood in Florence are the ones detailed in this handsome work; they also represent many of the dishes served in his restaurants.Pappa al pomodoro, a thick, rustic mixture of tomatoes, olive oil, garlic and basil mixed with bread, is typical. The name translates literally as ''tomato pap.''

2377	 2005	a	Doctors have known for years that giving patients a quick dose of antibiotics shortly before the first surgical incision is made will reduce the risk of infection.But a new study that looked at more than 2,900 hospitals has found that this is done only about half the time. The study, led by Dr. Dale W. Bratzler of the Oklahoma Foundation for Medical Quality, appears in the current Archives of Surgery.More than 2 percent of the 30 million operations performed each year lead to infection, the researchers say. Infections lead to higher death rates, longer hospital stays and bigger bills.Hospitals do, in fact, give most patients antibiotics before surgery, the study said. But the drugs are often wrong, the researchers found, and, more important, so is the timing. Most experts say the drugs should be given within an hour of surgery, so they do not wear off.

4927	 1990	a	To the Editor:John Russell's tribute to Tom Armstrong's tenure as director of the Whitney Museum of American Art is well founded [''Adding Up the Costs of Changes at the Top,'' March 18] . Nevertheless, he should not have been shocked by Mr. Armstrong's recent dismissal. It's an occupational hazard.A museum with contemporary focus - like the Whitney - whose trustees are committed largely to patronage of living artists cannot be expected to demonstrate policy based in tradition and stability. These contemporary patron-trustees tend to make decisions in a businessman's vacuum, unlike the ''collecteur-amateurs'' of earlier times.A practical truth may be that a museum director's job security varies directly with the average age of the works collected or exhibited by the museum. Although disturbing news for contemporary-museum officers, this equation should give comfort to those working at institutions solidly bound to the art of previous centuries.SHELDON PECKNewton, Mass.

2404	 2005	a	IT'S not surprising that "Riding the Bus With My Sister," the 2003 autobiographical book by Rachel Simon that inspired tonight's Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation, is set in a city that is never named. If word got out about the town's terrific bus drivers, the regulars would be standing in the aisles. And Ms. Simon's sister, Beth, the most fanatic of regulars, would be among them. In her book, Ms. Simon describes Beth (near right, with Ms. Simon) as "a person with mental retardation." She now prefers "with a developmental or cognitive disability," she said, although Beth likes "a person with special needs" -- one of them being the freedom to bus-hop around her city for most of the day. Like the book, the film, shown at 9 on CBS, is about the year Ms. Simon decided to enter her sister's world on wheels, but includes flashbacks to their childhood. During her time en route, Ms. Simon discovered the kindness of strangers (there are 12 bus drivers in her book, reduced to two composites in the movie), as well as the special abilities of the sister she had worried too much about for 38 years. "I've inadvertently become a national speaker for both the disability community and the public transit industry, and I meet bus drivers all around the country," she said. "They're a type of person that is well represented by the people in the movie -- very giving people, sensitive people, people people." It was at the house of one of Beth's bus-driving buddies that Ms. Simon and her sister first watched the film, which stars Andie MacDowell as a dewy-eyed Rachel and Rosie O'Donnell as a bouncy, beat-you-to-the-bus-door Beth. "What Rosie got," Ms. Simon said, "was exactly what she wanted to get: a character who is being portrayed not as a stereotype but as a full person -- someone who isn't going to be pushed around." Not even to the film's Los Angeles premiere. "Oh, yeah, she knows what she wants," Ms. Simon said of the real Beth. "She doesn't want to be on an airplane. And what's the fun of sitting in a movie theater with movie stars if you can sit on a bus with your favorite driver?" JODY ALESANDRO
3664	 1998	a	There is now little doubt that AIDS is becoming an epidemic of color, striking the African-American community to a disproportionate and devastating degree. Yet neither political leaders nor black institutions anticipated this demographic shift early enough to protect a vulnerable population that historically has been neglected in health care and prevention.Recent data from 25 states compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that African-Americans account for 57 percent of new infections with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, even though they make up only 13 percent of the United States population. While death rates from AIDS have dropped for all groups, the declines have been much greater among whites than blacks. Young blacks fare even worse. In data collected between January 1994 and June 1997, blacks accounted for 63 percent of infected individuals between the ages of 13 and 24.At the same time the disease is becoming more prevalent among women of all races, who account for more than a quarter of new infections. Young women, who make up 44 percent of those infected between the ages of 13 and 24, are especially hard hit. The changing face of the disease, from one with a vocal and educated constituency of gay men to one afflicting poor minorities, women and teen-agers, raises new challenges for prevention efforts.As the demographics change, the Government's AIDS policies must change as well. Expansion of needle exchange programs, safer-sex education in schools and drug treatment efforts would help slow the virus's spread into new groups through needles and sexual contact. But posturing in Congress has blocked these common-sense measures, leaving desperate communities even more vulnerable to the epidemic. Efforts by the Centers for Disease Control to direct some AIDS prevention funds to agencies serving minorities should be expanded substantially.

Screvane had criticized the office as “cell‐like” and had protested its proximity to the ladies’ room. Mr. Screvane replied orally that Mr. Modugno should devote more time to his constituents’ needs and less time to his own “creature comforts.”Mr. Modugno explained yesterday that he was as much concerned about the lack of secretarial assistance for councilmen as he was about the location of the office. Mr. Screvane should realize, he said, that the constituents’ needs would be better served when the councilmen had enough staff aid to perform their duties properly.The room outfitted for the five new Republican Councilmen at Large is long and narrow, and their desks are in a row.

5564	 1986	a	Protests over Moscow's delay in announcing the nuclear accident were particularly sharp from Sweden and Denmark.Prime Minister Poul Schluter of Denmark said, ''It is totally unacceptable and unsatisfactory that we can come to experience such a great, tragic nuclear power accident without the governments in the neighboring states being informed about what happened.''Sweden's Energy Minister, Birgitta Dahl, said her Government was preparing ''a list of demands with regard to the Soviet Union,'' noting that these would include steps to improve safety at nuclear plants. Previous requests by Sweden for the Soviet Union to improve plant safety have been ignored, Government officials say.Apparently trying to limit the diplomatic damage, the Soviet Ambassador met with Swedish officials today and pledged to provide more complete information about any further troubles at the Chernobyl plant.

309	 2017	a	The most telling moment on the debut album by the young soul singer Khalid, “American Teen,” comes at the end of the title track, which opens the album. The song begins with a beeping alarm and new-wave drum-machine slaps, then veers into a story of light youthful indiscretion: “I’m high up, off what?/I don’t even remember/But my friend passed out in the Uber ride.”Khalid is singing all this casually, without judgment or emphasis. He only starts vibrating more intensely in the second verse: “I’ve been waiting all year/To get the hell up out of here/And throw away my fears.” Khalid graduated high school last year — he’s 19 now — and he’s nailing the fitfulness of knowing the bright options the future might hold while still being stuck in school, or in his hometown, or in the frame of mind that tells you to do only what’s expected of you.That’s an almost universal teen conundrum, something Khalid acknowledges throughout this song with constant use of “we” and “our” (“We don’t always say what we mean,” “This is our year”). He’s sketching a generational mood, and drives the point home when at the end of the song, the digital shimmer falls away and, backed by only an acoustic guitar, a group of young men — high school friends from back in El Paso — bark-sing Khalid’s chorus. It’s a campfire singalong, a signifier of tactile humanity for a singer who knows how technology both redeems and corrupts.Image Khalid’s “American Teen.”“American Teen” is a promising amalgam of bedroom art-soul and 1980s new-wave pop maximalism, and a union of lonely-boy mirror gazing with a sense of larger cultural purpose. It most vividly recalls the promise embedded in the soundtracks of John Hughes films — that an outsider’s story might in fact be the thing that can unify and move millions.
1449	 2010	a	AP Photo/Stephen CherninThe Metropolitan Opera’s new production of Offenbach’s “Contes d’Hoffmann” stirred up heated debate within opera circles for the company’s decision to present a version of the score that fails to take into account recent research into the sources for this compromised score, left incomplete at Offenbach’s death. The new production of Bizet’s “Carmen” may also provoke some debate over questions of authenticity.Bizet wrote “Carmen” as an opéra-comique, which meant that extended stretches of dialogue were spoken, not sung. The term opéra-comique gives the false impression that such operas are comic. But even serious works within this tradition used spoken dialogue as a way of conveying everyday realism.“Carmen” had its premiere in Paris in March 1875, just months before Bizet died at 36. Later that year, for a production of “Carmen” in Vienna, the composer Ernest Guiraud adapted the spoken dialogue from the libretto (by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy) into recitative, which he wrote. It was in this version that “Carmen” gained its immense popularity for the next century.Starting in the 1960s or so, it became increasingly common for “Carmen” to be performed as Bizet intended: with spoken dialogue. The Met chose that option for its celebrated 1972 production, starring Marilyn Horne and conducted by Leonard Bernstein, documented in a Deutsche Grammophon recording.For its new production, by the director Richard Eyre, the Met is using Guiraud-composed recitatives, which was also the choice of Franco Zeffirelli, who created the previous production in 1996, a lamentable show. Purists will no doubt object to the Met’s recalcitrance on this matter.Pragmatic reasons are typically cited when a company chooses to use Guiraud’s recitatives. Singers who are not native French speakers are often reluctant to speak the language on stage. Also, mezzo-sopranos who revere classic old recordings, like the historic 1951 RCA recording starring Risë Stevens, with Fritz Reiner conducting, often long to sing the role the way they heard it growing up.The Met’s new “Carmen” is a gripping and brilliant production. Still, I would have been willing to hear certain singers speak imperfect French for the chance to experience the opera with the realistic urgency that comes from having the dialogue spoken. In this case, Elina Garanca, the Met’s Latvian Carmen, would have been trading many spoken lines with Roberto Alagna, the French tenor of Sicilian heritage, which would had added pressure on the star.Today, at least a majority of opera companies around the world present “Carmen” without the Guiraud recitatives. Let the debate begin.

2368	 2005	a	Tourism experts had hoped that Rochester would capitalize on its Lake Ontario location, a 171-mile boat trip from Toronto. The city found developers in the late 1990's, when two Rochester natives, Dominick DeLucia and Brian F. Prince, took up the idea. The men, friends since graduate school, had made their fortunes at Lehman Brothers in New York City and returned to their hometown with the idea of helping it to better times. They spent several years putting together their plan and arranging financing from Dutch and Australian lenders for the purchase of the ferry last year for $42.5 million. The ferry has a movie theater, a gift shop and a restaurant and can make the voyage in under three hours.Almost immediately, their company, Canadian American Transportation Systems, ran into trouble. Mr. DeLucia said they were undercapitalized and could not cope with several mishaps, including a docking accident at a Manhattan pier after the ferry was brought from an Australian shipyard to Rochester last spring. After repairs, the engine malfunctioned. Both incidents pushed back the start date by several weeks, while the company continued to incur payroll and other expenses.Higher fuel prices and customs and pilot fees added to the company's debt, along with a loss of anticipated revenue from transporting tractor-trailers, which were not allowed on board because of increased border security.The ferry, which can carry 774 passengers and 238 cars, often sold out. But the company was more than $2 million in debt by Labor Day. After only 80 days, the owners abruptly stopped service, leaving 200 without jobs and hundreds of others with worthless tickets."Reading the future isn't possible," said Magistrate Jonathan W. Feldman of the district court. Pointing out that there are "risks and rewards" in every business venture, he said that "no one has ever disagreed" about the vessel being given a fair opportunity to succeed in this community."

She easily won her singles match as play started in the $85,000 Mutual Benefit Life open at the Orange Lawn Tennis Club.Dr. Richards, a 42‐year‐old transsexual and the center of controversy since she entered the women's field in a tournament here last year, advanced to the second round with a 6‐1, 6‐1 success over 17‐year‐old Donna Lies of Springfield, N.J.Miss Lies, who ranked 33d in last year's national ratings for girls 16 years and under, was far too nervous to give much opposition to her opponent, an ophthalmologist, from Newport Beach, Calif. Dr. Richards gave Miss Lies a lesson in depth of strokes from the baseline, and delivered sone serves rarely seen on the junior and women's circuit.But over all, the winner's game was somewhat erratic, especially from the backhand side.“I was disappointed with my serve,” said Dr. Richards. “Also, I didn't move Donna around. I should have had more versatile game.”

1280	 2011	a	Fans and pundits will surely debate the extent and the quality of the Knicks’ progress this season.They have a winning record (but just barely).They are on a pace to make the playoffs (as a lower seed).They might win a first-round series (though it seems unlikely).They have an undisputed star in Amar’e Stoudemire (but he is not LeBron James).Yet the progress is both tangible and indisputable, and a credit to Donnie Walsh, the team president, who over two years dismantled a dysfunctional, overpaid lineup and replaced it with a cohesive, respectable, reasonably priced team.As Walsh awaits word about his future, it is instructive to look back to the roster he was handed on April 1, 2008, which may look even worse in retrospect than it did at the time.Six of the 15 players Walsh inherited are out of the league — not counting Eddy Curry, who might as well be. Three others are on N.B.A. rosters but barely playing. That leaves only five players of any significance.Without further ado, welcome to “The Isiah-era Knicks: Where are they now?”Thriving, MostlyZach Randolph, Memphis Grizzlies Had a brief and forgettable stopover with the Los Angeles Clippers. Now producing the usual gaudy numbers for Memphis: 20 points and a career-best 13.2 rebounds a game. Has not made the playoffs or been part of a winning team, though the Grizzlies have a shot at the eighth seed in the West. Salary in 2008: $13.3 million. Current salary: $17.3 million. How he left: Traded (with Mardy Collins) to Clippers, for Cuttino Mobley and Tim Thomas, on Nov. 21, 2008.Jamal Crawford, Atlanta Hawks Won the Sixth Man of the Year award last season, simultaneously proving that Crawford was a) one of the better players Isiah Thomas acquired and b) was miscast by Thomas as a starting guard and No. 1 scoring option. Remains a key reserve for playoff-bound Hawks, but scoring and shooting percentages have dipped, to 15.9 points and 43 percent. Salary in 2008: $7.9 million. Current salary: $10.1 million. How he left: Traded to Warriors, for Al Harrington, on Nov. 21, 2008.David Lee, Golden State Warriors Named an All-Star in final Knicks season, albeit as an injury replacement. Was the best member of a bad Knicks team, averaging 20.2 points and 11.7 rebounds. Now a solid member of a poor Warriors team, averaging 16 points and 9.7 rebounds. Salary in 2008: $990,000. Current salary: $10.8 million. How he left: In sign-and-trade deal with Warriors, for Anthony Randolph, Ronny Turiaf and Kelenna Azubuike, on July 8, 2010.Nate Robinson, Boston Celtics Other than Crawford, the only Isiah-era Knick to play a major role for a playoff team. Helped fuel Celtics’ Game 4 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers in 2010 N.B.A. finals. Now averaging 7.7 points and shooting .412 as the Celtics’ sixth man. Salary in 2008: $1.3 million. Current salary: $4.2 million. How he left: Traded (with Marcus Landry) to Boston, for Eddie House, Bill Walker and J.R. Giddens, on Feb. 18, 2010.Wilson Chandler, Knicks Thomas’s best parting gift — a talented, low-maintenance, high-scoring forward who always plays hard and improves every year. Averaging a career-best 17.4 points. Current salary: $2.1 million. Future: A free agent this summer, could be used in trade for Carmelo Anthony or let go to make room for Anthony.Approaching IrrelevanceQuentin Richardson, Orlando Magic Opened season as a key rotation player, became superfluous when Magic acquired Gilbert Arenas and Jason Richardson. Played 57 minutes in January. Salary in 2008: $8.1 million. Current salary: $2.3 million. How he left: Traded to Memphis, for Darko Milicic, on June 26, 2008.Jared Jeffries, Houston Rockets Found niche as versatile defender in his final years with Knicks. Niche in Houston is between 13th and 14th seats on the bench. Has made 17 appearances this season, averaging 7.8 minutes. (Side note: Thomas, upon signing Jeffries, said he would “balance the plane ride.”) Salary in 2008: $5.6 million. Current salary: $6.9 million. How he left: Traded to Houston (with Jordan Hill) in three-team deal that brought Tracy McGrady to Knicks, on Feb. 18, 2010.Renaldo Balkman, Denver Nuggets The hustle. The hair. The Rodman-like nose for the ball. There was little to enjoy about these Knicks, but Balkman’s frantic energy was something. He is more static now: He has played 44 minutes this season. (Side note: Balkman was drafted one spot ahead of Rajon Rondo in 2006.) Salary in 2008: $1.3 million. Current salary: $1.7 million. How he left: Traded to Denver for Taurean Green, Bobby Jones and a second-round pick, on July 28, 2008. (Jones and Green were later waived.)Eddy Curry, Knicks Symbol of an era of overpaid underachievers. Peaked in 2006-7 (19.5 points a game), regressing ever since. Unable to stay healthy or in shape jeopardizing career. Has appeared in 10 games since start of the 2008-9 season. Salary in 2008: $8.9 million. Current salary: $11.3 million.

3829	 1997	a	Michael Winerip's article made me wonder how many relatives of Jews trapped in Germany or Austria in the late 1930's may have received similar pleas for help. My mother, Martha Gomberg, received one -- a cable from a distant cousin in danger in Vienna. My mother gathered our family's available funds ($600, I believe) and went from Cleveland to Cuba. Somehow she managed to meet with the president-dictator, Fulgencio Batista, give him the money and ask him to issue visas for her cousin's family: a mother, father and 12-year-old son. I think she had never before been south of Ohio.Miraculously, Batista kept his word. Our cousins arrived in Cuba on the last boat that was allowed to discharge refugees. The son was permitted to come to the United States almost immediately. He lived with us for a year until his parents were allowed to enter.After their narrow escape from the Nazis, our cousins prospered in this country. One happy ending among so many tragic ones.Joanne NathansBaltimore

3485	 1999	a	MOST people look at a lettuce and see salad. Designers look at a lettuce and see lettuce green.''What would you think of that color on a chair?'' Richard Schultz, a furniture designer, asked, pointing to the bright floppy head sticking out of the ground in a vegetable garden fenced by tall wire tangled with wild purple roses. A chair in the garden is apple green, last month's flavor, which the designer chose by walking into a local paint store with an apple in his hand, picked from the tree behind his studio.Mr. Schultz, 72, has spent the last 45 years getting to know his materials. As much as the metals and plastics that inspire innovation in furniture, they are the lettuces, leafy ferns, the light and shadow and lichened stone walls of the 49-acre, 19th-century farm he shares with his wife, Trudy.Mr. Schultz is not a gardener. But he has cultivated the outdoors, planting designs in the landscape to see if visual relationships will grow.The two small houses, barn, gardens and pond that sit within a circus of woods have been his laboratory for introducing man-made objects thoughtfully into the most fragile, temperamental of settings: nature.

3677	 1998	a	Frankie Andreu said before the start of the Tour de France's 19th stage today that his legs were dead and that there was no point in expecting him to join a large, early breakaway.No way, he said. No legs.Andreu, an American rider for the United States Postal Service team, sounded convincing even though his goal in this Tour, his seventh, was identical with his goal in the first six: get in a good breakaway and win a stage. It had not happened yet, and there were only three days to go before the finish in Paris on Sunday.A breakaway was expected by nearly all of the 96 riders left because the journey from La Chaux- de-Fonds in Switzerland to Autun in France measured 150 miles and most teams with top sprinters, like Mapei and Telekom, said that they were too tired to lead a long chase for a chance at a mass rush to the finish.With only 14 of the original 21 teams left after the withdrawal of the last five TVM riders this morning and at least four teams intent on a restful day, the road was open to an early acceleration.

259	 2018	a	“One franc,” Mr. Aznavour said. “After that I was able to tell my friends I was better paid than Piaf.”In 1958, the French government lifted a longstanding ban on allowing some of Mr. Aznavour’s more explicit songs — like “Après l’Amour,” which recounts the aftermath of an episode of lovemaking — on the radio. “I was the first to write about social issues like homosexuality,” Mr. Aznavour told The Times in 2006, referring to his 1972 song “What Makes a Man?” “I find real subjects and translate them into song.”He returned to New York in 1963 and rented Carnegie Hall, where he performed to a packed house. (Among those in the audience was Bob Dylan, who later said it was one of the greatest live performances he had ever witnessed.) A triumphant world tour followed.Thereafter, the United States became a second home. Mr. Aznavour performed all over the country, often with Liza Minnelli. He became a fixture in Las Vegas for a time and there married Ulla Thorsell, a former model, in 1967. She was his third wife.Mr. Aznavour had six children. Complete information on survivors was not immediately available.As a child, Mr. Aznavour watched his father go broke feeding penniless Armenian refugees in his restaurant. As his fame grew, he became a spokesman and fund-raiser for the Armenian cause. He organized help worldwide after an earthquake killed 45,000 people in Armenia in 1988. And when the country broke away from the crumbling Soviet Union in 1991, it made him an unofficial ambassador. He displayed the Corps Diplomatique plaque on his car as proudly as he wore the French Legion of Honor ribbon in his lapel.

6058	 1977	a	SURROUNDED by repeats and a generally uninspired schedule, more energetic viewers might consider a visit this weekend to the film and video department of the Whitney Museum at Madison Avenue add 75th Street, A 70‐minute history of bloadcasting, produced by TVTV is being shown several times each day through Sunday.The project was presented in piecemeal fashion on public television as “fillers” of various lengths following sayeral productions in the “Visions” series. Using solid facts and selective dramatio recreations, TVTV, a group of video documentarians and satirists, traces brpadcasting from marvelous toy to incredible money‐making machine. In some cases, the names of major characters have been changed to demolish the guilty and avoid harassing lawsuits.•At home, one of the few presentations with even minimum pretensions to originality is something called “The Star Show.” This hour was produced by Group W as a pilot for a possible fill serest. It can be seen Sunday at 9 P.M. on WNEW/Channel 5.

1940	 2008	a	Among the many dispiriting things to come out of Bob Woodward’s quartet of books on George W. Bush is his observation that the president has not changed since he first started talking to Woodward in 2001.No growth. No evolution. No regrets.“History,” Bush replied, when asked by Woodward how he would be judged over time. “We don’t know. We’ll all be dead.” Broke, as well.It would have been nice to let Bush’s two terms marinate a while before invoking Herbert Hoover and James Buchanan from the cellar of worst presidents. But then — over the last two weeks — he completed the trilogy of national disasters that will be with us for a generation or more.George Bush entered the White House as a proponent of a more humble foreign policy and a believer that government should get out of the way at home. He leaves as someone with a trillion-dollar war aimed at making people who’ve hated each other for a thousand years become Rotary Club freedom-lovers, and his own country close to bankruptcy after government did get out of the way.It’s a Mount Rainier of shame and folly. But before going any further, let’s allow his supporters to have their say.“He’s going to have an unbelievably great legacy,” said Laura Bush in an ABC interview, citing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. “Fifty million people liberated from very brutal regimes.”Fred Barnes argues that Bush is a visionary on a par with Ronald Reagan and Franklin D. Roosevelt. “Bush is a president who leads,” he wrote in a 2006 book. “He controls the national agenda, uses his presidential power to the fullest and then some, prepares far-reaching polices likely to change the way Americans live, reverses other long-standing polices and is the foremost leader in world affairs.”Finally, from Karl Rove, the Architect. Bush will be viewed “as a far-sighted leader who confronted the key test of the 21st century,” he said.After wading through books with words like “fiasco,” “hubris” and “denial” in the title, historians will go to first-hand sources, the people who worked with Bush daily. There they will find Paul O’Neill, the president’s former Treasury secretary. In 2002, he sounded an alarm, saying Bush’s rash economic policies could lead to a deficit of $500 billion. This, after Bush had inherited a budget surplus, prompted many to scoff at O’Neill.He was wrong, but only in one respect – the projected deficit, even without a financial bailout, will almost certainly be higher.This means a lot, for every bridge not built, every Pell grant not given to a kid who may never go to college without one, every national park road left to crumble, every sick person who cannot afford to see a doctor in a country that wants to be known as the best on earth.Historians will also go to Scott McClellan, the former White House press secretary. Bush may not be a “high functioning moron,” as Paul Begala called him recently. He is “plenty smart enough to be president,” McClellan wrote this year. But McClellan, in his job as the president’s mouthpiece, found him chronically incurious. He also said Bush deliberately misled the country into war, and in that effort, the news media were “complicit enablers.”Historians will recall that in each of the major disasters on Bush’s watch, there were ample warnings — from the intelligence briefing that Osama bin Laden was determined to strike a month before the lethal blow, to the projections that Hurricane Katrina could drown a major American city, to the expressed fears that letting Wall Street regulate itself could be catastrophic.Voluntary regulation. That phrase now joins “heckuva job, Brownie” and “mission accomplished” among those that will always be associated with the Bush presidency.It’s painful now to realize, just as the economy craters and the world looks aghast at the United States, that the other cancer from the Bush presidency – his failure to even start the nation on the road to a new energy economy – gets short-changed during the triage of his final days.Bush has hinted that his legacy will be about the war. So be it. He never caught bin Laden, the mass murderer who launched the raison d’etre of the Bush presidency.But he did topple a paper army in Iraq, opening the drainage for our currency, blood and global reputation. It may go down as the longest, even costliest war in our history.In a survey of scholars done earlier this year, just two of 109 historians said the Bush presidency would be judged a success. A majority said he would be the worst president ever.But if you don’t trust those elites in academia, consider the president’s own base.Bush leaves with his party in tatters. In the 28 states that register by affiliation, Democrats have picked up more than 2 million new voters this year while Republicans have lost 344,000. It seems only fitting that it was the last of the Bush dead-enders in Congress earlier this week who jumped ship when presented with the final horrendous hangover from this man who doesn’t drink.If ever there was an argument for voting against politicians who are confident about their cluelessness, Bush is it. So it was heartening to see that a majority of the country, in some polls, now views Sarah Palin as unqualified to be president.We may have learned something, even if Bush has not.

6438	 1970	a	¶ A variation of the alternate side‐parking regulation might require cars to be parked in the center of the street from 8 to 11 o'clock in the morning to leave both curbs free for street cleaning.¶ proposal will be made to set up an “environmental court” to handle sanitation and other pollution violations ad ministratively, so that prosecu tions would not be bogged down in the present courts.¶ Although he is putting strong faith in newly designed trash baskets, old 55‐gallon steel drums with their tops cut Dff may be the answer to the container problem, because they would not be so attractive to thieves, who have made off with thousands of the city's wire‐mesh baskets.¶ Reports of sanitation truck breakdowns have been com mon because the magnitude of the refine‐collection job re quires that the trucks be worked longer — “We work our trucks from 6 in the morning to mid night; private outfit does that”Stress on Mechanical Aids.Mr. Kretchmer did not say how the department's new man power, announced earlier this year, would be deployed in the cleanup operation. There have been suggestions that manual sweeping is the only way the streets will ever be made really clean.But Mr. Kretchmer said the cost of hand labor by sanitation men — who he said earned an average of $10,500 a year with overtime — was becoming pro hibitive. He intends to rely heavily on mechanical aids to extend his manpower.One of these aids he was especially enthusiastic about was a three‐wheeled motor scooter with a dump body, on which a sanitationman rides from street to street.

He was 61.The cause was prostate cancer, said NancyBell Coe, the orchestra's manager.Mr. Majeske was born in Detroit in 1932 and made his orchestral debut with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra when he was 16. After studying with Ivan Galamian at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, he joined the United States Navy Band in Washington in 1951.During his four years in the Navy Band, Mr. Majeske also studied theology with the intention of becoming a minister. But he also wrote to George Szell, the music director of the Cleveland Orchestra, seeking an audition. Szell offered him a seat in the orchestra's first violin section. Mr. Majeske became the orchestra's assistant concertmaster in 1959 and its associate concertmaster in 1967. A Turning PointWhen Rafael Druian abruptly resigned hours before a recording session for the Brahms Double Concerto in 1969, Mr. Majeske performed the solo violin line. Szell appointed him concertmaster the next day. He performed as a soloist with the orchestra more than 100 times, and his performance of the Martinu Concerto last April was recorded by London Records for release next year. He is also the violin soloist on the orchestra's recordings of Richard Strauss's "Also Sprach Zarathustra" and "Heldenleben" and Rimsky-Korsakov's "Scheherezade."

800	 2014	a	ROSENTHAL--Nan, age 76, died peacefully at home on Sunday, April 27, 2014. Beloved wife of Henry B. Cortesi, she was born in New York City on August 27, 1937. She graduated from the Fieldston School, Sarah Lawrence College and earned a PhD from Harvard. She began her career in journalism but turned to the study of art history focusing on post-WWII American artists. She excelled as a scholar, curator, teacher, and mentor. Nan was Senior Consultant of 20th Century Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art until her retirement in 2008. Before moving back to New York after her marriage to Henry in 1991, she was curator of 20th Century Art at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and before that, a professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz. Over her long, varied and highly distinguished career, she accumulated a very large, diverse and devoted group of friends who enlivened and enriched her life as she did theirs. We are all deeply grieved and diminished by her death. A memorial for Nan will be held in September. In lieu of flowers, the family request that contributions be made in Nan's memory to the Financial Aid Fund of the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, 33 Central Park W. NY, NY 10023.

2242	 2006	a	Brazilians’ hopes for the World Cup are high, as Larry Rohter reports from Rio in today’s Times. “All the stars are aligned in our favor,” one fan told Rohter. “We’ve got the talent, the experience, a favorable draw and a steady-handed coach” — Carlos Alberto Parreira — “who has already guided us to one Cup.”But at least one of the stars came unaligned today when it was announced that the Barcelona defender Edmilson has dropped out of the tournament with torn knee cartilage.The Guardian speculates that Edmilson’s role on the team — as a kind of stopper or holding midfielder alongside Emerson — will be taken by Gilberto Silva of Arsenal.UPDATE: This post has been corrected to reflect the fact that, as several readers pointed out, Edmilson was expected to play for Brazil in the Cup but was not in the projected starting line-up announced by the coach Carlos Alberto Parreira last month.

3280	 2000	a	Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students explore the issue of the separation of church and state by researching various scenarios that have informed the most recent debate.Author(s):Elyse Fischer, The New York Times Learning NetworkSuggested Time Allowance: 1 hourObjectives:Students will:1. Articulate their understanding of the framers’ intentions with respect to the separation of church and state as these men wrote the Constitution and created the American government.2. Explore the issue of church/state separation and how it is currently manifesting itself in Ohio by reading and discussing “Holy Cow! Ohio Has A Motto Problem.”3. Examine other church/state issues and their resolution through research and discussion.4. Synthesize and reflect upon the issue by creating a poster and writing an essay.Resources / Materials:-student journals-pens/pencils-classroom blackboard-paper-copies of “Holy Cow! Ohio Has a Motto Problem” (one per student)-classroom reference materials (encyclopedias, history textbooks, reference books on the United States, computers with Internet access)-large pieces of poster board or construction paper for postersActivities / Procedures:1. WARM UP/DO NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following questions (written on the board prior to class): What is meant by the “separation of Church and State”? Why did the framers of the Constitution deem the separation of church and state so important when creating the Constitution? Do you think it is as important in the United States today?2. As a class read and discuss “Holy Cow! Ohio Has a Motto Problem,” focusing on the following questions:a. What is a motto?b. Why do states or localities have mottos?c. How do you think the author of the article, Jane Fritsch, chose her title?d. Why did the United States Court of Appeals rule that “With God, All Things Are Possible” cannot be used as the motto for the state of Ohio?e. Why is a quotation from the New Testament considered Christian?f. Why can the federal government use “In God We Trust” as a slogan when Ohio can’t use “With God, All Things Are Possible”?g. How did the “skirmish” over the separation of church and state begin in regards to the Ohio state motto?h. According to the Ohio State Historical Society, why was the motto “Imperium in Imperio” or “An Empire Within An Empire” rejected in 1866?i. Also, according to the article, why did Ohio’s 1959 slogan “languish” until George Voinovich returned from a trip to India? What did he see in India that prompted him to initiate a new use of the old motto?j. What was the initial federal ruling about the motto?k. What is an appeals court?l. Why did the American Civil Liberties Union (A.C.L.U.) appeal the initial decision?m. Why does the length of the Court’s opinion suggest that it was a difficult decision for the justices to make?n. The article cites instances in which the courts approved of the presence of the word God in government activities. Give some examples.o. How did the state of Ohio argue against the A.C.L.U’s contention that the quotation constitutes an “endorsement” of the Christian religion?p. According to the author, how will the State of Ohio respond to the ruling?q. From the tone of the article, do you think that Jane Fritsch has an opinion about the Court’s ruling?3. Divide students into five groups. Assign each group one of the following scenarios: a group of students wishes to form a Bible Study club or a prayer club in school; a state legislates that parents can use state funded vouchers or get tax credit for sending their children to religious based parochial schools; an elementary school, City Hall or the local courthouse is decorated for Christmas with a tree and a nativity scene; the coach of a football team leads the team in prayer before a game; the state funds an aide to help a deaf student get through his or her day, and the student goes to a private, religious school. In their groups, students should discuss how their scenario might be considered a church/state issue. Students should then research one example of the issue using the following questions as guidelines (written on the board for easier student access):-Why is this considered a church/state separation issue?-What similar court case pertained to the scenario?-Who were the “key players” in the case?-How did the Court decide?-What was the basis of the Court’s opinion?4. WRAP UP/HOMEWORK: Working in their groups, students create a poster documenting their research. Students should be encouraged to make their posters visually interesting by incorporating photographs and drawings into their text. Individually, students should write an opinion piece about their assigned scenario. Students share their work at a later date.Further Questions for Discussion:–Should mottos change as a population changes?–Is it appropriate for the United States to use “In God We Trust” as a slogan? Support your answer.–Separation of church and state issues are very contentious. Why?–What other issues do you think people feel equally as passionately about?–Are there church/state issues in your own community? How are they handled?–Why do institutions create mottos?–Do you think that use of a motto from the New Testament is appropriate for a state in the United States? Why or why not?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on written journal entries, participation in class and group discussions and thoughtful participation in research and poster creation.Vocabulary:seal, motto, slogan, skirmish, pretentious, feudal, salvation, invoke, divine, humility, affinity, overt, unconstitutional, appealExtension Activities:1. Create a motto for your school or community. Take into account the people who live or work there, whether there is a unified belief system, the presence of minority points of view, and how the motto will be used while creating the motto.2. Research the “Establishment Clause” of the Constitution? Who was responsible for including the Establishment Clause in the first amendment? (Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging thefreedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for aredress of grievances.) Why did the Framers include it? Create a poster or report about the first amendment, paying particular attention to the establishment clause and its history.3. Create a timeline with important Supreme Court decisions that have addressed the issue of separation of church and state. How did the Supreme Court’s opinions evolve over time? Are there trends?4. Research the motto of your state. What are its origins? Do you think it should be changed? If you believe it should be changed, write a letter proposing a new motto to your state legislature. Outline your arguments against the old motto and suggest a replacement.5. The article mentions that the State of Ohio is sure to appeal the Federal Ruling. How does the appeals process work? Describe the appeals process in a report or on a poster.6. What is the American Civil Liberties Union? Contact your local branch of the A.C.L.U. for primary source material. Do research on the A.C.L.U. on the Internet. What kinds of cases is the A.C.L.U. usually involved with? What have they been involved with in your state?7. Many states have official state anthems, birds, flowers, and even official state cookies. Research state symbols. Create a chart noting the symbols of different states.Interdisciplinary Connections:Fine Arts – The “Star Spangled Banner” is the national anthem. Do you think it is an appropriate anthem for the United States? Research the history of the “Star Spangled Banner.” Make an argument for a contemporary alternative to the anthem.Foreign Language – Many states, localities, universities etc. have mottos that come from Latin, Greek or Hebrew. (For example, E pluribus Unum – “Out of Many, One”, is found on the Great Seal of the United States.) Why do you think these languages are so common? Find some examples of these mottos. What do they mean in translation.Geography – Make a map of the United States, incorporating all of the mottos of the states. Postulate on why you think certain states chose certain models. Research and find out whether your answers come close to the reasons given in text.Global History – Find examples of countries that have an official, state-sanctioned religion, examples of countries that have a clear separation between church and state and examples of countries that have governments that have made clear disavowals of religion. Create a chart or table, comparing and contrasting different aspects of these nations. For instance, what type of government is in place in these countries? Are there laws protecting religious or ethnic minorities? Is the law of the land secular or religious or a combination of the two? Are there differences between and among categories? (i.e. Some nations with institutionalized religion might ascribe to secular laws, some might not.)Media Studies – If you received all of your information about the United States from what you saw in television and in the movies, what would you believe to be the dominant American attitude toward God and religion? Make a journal of your television and movie experiences over the next week. Is there evidence of the America being portrayed by the mainstream media as having a particular attitude toward God and religion?Science – Scientists often struggle with seeming contradictions between faith and science. (The theory of evolution is a good example.) Why might some scientists have this struggle?Teaching With The Times – How has the Times covered church/state issues? Using an example from the lesson, trace the Times coverage of one particular issue as it relates to church/state issues.background: If students are unclear about the controversy that frequently surrounds the issue of separation of church and state, Americans United for the Separation of Church and State (//www.au.org) is an easily navigable Web site. As always, it is important that students consider the source of their information.Other Information on the Web:Americans United for Separation of Church and State (//www.au.org/) works to protect the constitutional principle of church-state separation.The American Civil Liberties Union, or the ACLU (//www.aclu.org/), is the nation’s foremost advocate of individual rights — litigating, legislating, and educating the public on a broad array of issues affecting individual freedom in the United States.Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8United States History Standard 8- Understands the institutions and practices of government created during the Revolution and how these elements were revised between 1787 and 1815 to create the foundation of the American political system based on the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

5823	 1984	a	Airports, seaports and border posts have been closed and both telephone and telex communications with Nigeria have been cut.President Shagari began his second term only three months ago after Nigeria's first civilian-run elections. Elections in 1979 had been conducted by the army. The election campaign this year was a remarkably open and freewheeling affair and the elections themselves, though marred by irregularities, were viewed as an exercise in democracy.''There were instances of fraud by all the parties involved in the elections,'' a Nigerian commentator said. ''But I don't think anyone can seriously claim that Shagari would have lost had all the rigging been eliminated.''Scattered outbreaks of violence after the elections were quickly extinguished, and the courts overturned some results as fraudulent. In recent months, the situation has been generally calm.Mr. Shagari had pledged to wage an aggressive fight against corruption and inefficiency during what, under the Constitution, would have had to be his final term in office.Nigeria HistoryWith a population of 85 million, Nigeria is the most populous African country. Its vast natural resources, particularly its rich oil reserves, have made it one of the most economically and politically important countries on the continent's West coast.Nigeria was one of Britain's major colonial prizes in Africa. British traders and missionaries initially worked their way up the Niger River, forerunners of the British rule that began in 1861. However, it was not until the 1920's that the amalgamation of Nigeria's diverse tribal groups in a single colony and protectorate was finally accomplished.

1505	 2010	a	I welcome your comments on my Sunday column, which defends the Catholic Church in ways that won’t make the Vatican happy. It’s a follow-up to a column of a couple of weeks ago talking about the two churches that leave me somewhat dizzied and bewildered, the old-boys club at the Vatican and the heroic one at the grassroots.Some readers objected that it’s all one church, good and bad, and that the grassroots church is possible only because of support from the top. But the nuns and priests who are out in the field doing heroic work actually get remarkably little support from the Vatican or from church collections, and the divergence is immense. To me at least, and I can’t claim to be a close observer, so much of the Vatican is about protocol and bureaucratic self-defense and ritual, while so many of the folks in the field just care about serving others. Father Michael may have been the worst-dressed priest I’ve ever seen – and the noblest.Critics of the church object for a different reason. As they see it, there may be some selfless nuns and priests out there, but at the end of the day they represent an institution that sanctifies male supremacy and that opposes condoms to fight AIDS. To me, that doesn’t quite seem right. Many nuns and priests in Latin America and Africa don’t really represent Vatican policy on, say, condoms but subvert it. Sometimes nuns and priests hand out condoms to keep parishioners alive. The Catholic Church truly is catholic, with a small c, in the sense of being broad and varied.In any case, please post your comments on the column. And, whatever your position, thanks for being respectful of other commenters.

976	 2013	a	Though there was once a time when Netflix was most closely associated with its bright red DVD-return envelopes, the company — now better known as a video-streaming service — is hoping that orange will be its color this summer. On Tuesday, Netflix announced that it has scheduled its next original series, “Orange Is the New Black,” a comedy-drama set in a women’s prison, to have its premiere on July 11; and, as has become its custom, it will make all thirteen episodes of the series available for viewing at once.Adapted from Piper Kerman’s memoir of the same title, “Orange Is the New Black” chronicles a Brooklyn woman (played by Taylor Schilling) whose relationship with a drug runner (Laura Prepon) gets her sentenced to a year in prison. The series, which also stars Jason Biggs, Kate Mulgrew, Natasha Lyonne and Pablo Schreiber, is created by Jenji Kohan, who previously mined laughs from law-breaking women as the creator of the Showtime comedy “Weeds.”“Orange Is the New Black” will be the fourth original series that Netflix has introduced this year, following its hit political drama “House of Cards,” its suspense thriller “Hemlock Grove” and its new season of “Arrested Development,” which will have its debut on May 26.

5735	 1985	a	''The trouble with most raspberry jam,'' says Rose Levy Beranbaum, ''is that it has too much sugar in it, and if you try to cut back on the sugar the pectin won't jell the jam.''But Mrs. Beranbaum, whose cooking school, Cordon Rose, specializes in pastries and chocolate, was undaunted by the prospect of creating a low-sugar jam without any added pectin. Pectin is a carbohydrate that occurs naturally in some fruits, such as apples, and causes a gel to form when the fruit is cooked. Raspberries do not have the natural pectin to turn them into preserves without a little help from powdered pectin.Mrs. Beranbaum wanted a jam in which the tartness and fruitiness of the berries was not masked by the sugar, so she turned her kitchen into a laboratory and set to work. It took her only three attempts -over a three-year period - to perfect the technique. It produces a jam that is intensely fruity and very tart, so tart that some people might be inclined to add a bit more sugar. Mrs. Beranbaum says that will not affect the intense berry flavor because her cooking method concentrates it.Required: Time and a SieveAlthough the technique is quite different from ordinary jam-making, it is not difficult. It does, however, take time. Batches of the fruit are cooked down, combined with the sugar syrup and cooked again. Because the berries become so concentrated it is important to sieve the jam and eliminate some of the seeds; they can be used to make raspberry vinegar.

On the other, high-flying Texas Tech’s offensive philosophy provides a similar picture to Oklahoma, though more skewed towards the passing game. The same questions exist here as do in the B.C.S. national championship game: Can Texas Tech control the Ole Miss front seven? Can the Ole Miss secondary contain Graham Harrell and Michael Crabtree? And like the national title game, the Cotton Bowl is expected to be a good one.The Cotton Bowl: Friday, Jan. 2 at 2 p.m. in DallasMississippiWhat a difference a year makes for the Rebels, who ended last season on the lowest of low notes (blowing a 14-0 lead in the Egg Bowl). What a difference a new coach makes as well. Houston Nutt has reversed the losing trend developed under Ed Orgeron, who led the Rebels to only 10 wins over three seasons. Few bowl teams finished the regular season hotter than Ole Miss, which won its final five games to finish 8-4, its best record since the Eli Manning-led 2003 team went 10-3. The Rebels’ quarterback is the Texas transfer Jevan Snead, who was terrific in his first year as the starter. He threw 15 touchdowns against only 2 interceptions during Mississippi’s five-game win streak. End Greg Hardy and tackle Peria Jerry combine to give Ole Miss one of the most formidable defensive lines in the country.Texas TechBecause of the hullabaloo about who was left out of the title game, you tend to forget about the teams who were left out of the B.C.S. entirely. Texas Tech, along with Boise State, is a team with a genuine B.C.S. resume (a 39-33 win over then-No. 1 Texas, for starters) which found itself on the outside looking in. The Red Raiders are the only one-loss team from a B.C.S. conference left out. Of course, the reason Tech is in the Cotton Bowl and not, say, the Fiesta or Sugar Bowl, was the 65-21 trouncing dropped on it by Oklahoma, which did irreparable damage to its national standing. Word of the wise to the Red Raiders: Sleep on this game, don’t come to play, and Ole Miss will be only too happy to take full advantage. Thinking outside the box, keep an eye on (if you can find him) the diminutive receiver Eric Morris, who finished second on the team with eight receiving touchdowns. Morris makes Wes Welker, another undersized Tech receiver, look like Randy Moss.Mississippi Bowl HistoryRecord: 19-12Last appearance: 2004 Cotton Bowl vs. Oklahoma State (W, 31-28)Texas Tech Bowl HistoryRecord: 10-20-1Last appearance: 2008 Gator Bowl vs. Virginia (W, 31-28)Cotton Bowl HistoryFirst played in 1937Last year: Missouri 38, Arkansas 7Bowl Pick ‘EmPete: Mississippi.

New question that Rebels Coach Houston Nutt can ask his team next season: “How many have won a bowl game before?”Paul: Texas Tech. But the Ole Miss front four is going to give Tech fits.Fred: Texas Tech. Love the Red Raiders and love Mike Leach. This is one of the more intriguing non-B.C.S. bowl games. I just think Texas Tech has too much offense.Connor: Texas Tech. Ole Miss is headed on the right track with Houston Nutt, but Graham Harrell and Michael Crabtree make the Red Raiders too explosive.
4263	 1994	a	The Federal program aimed at improving basic academic skills of low-income children, known as Chapter 1, needs major revision. Over the years, its funds have been spread too thin and fail to help many of the neediest students.The Clinton Administration has put forth a sensible plan to concentrate more money on the most disadvantaged students. As Congress begins marking up the bill this week, it should follow the Administration's lead -- and go even further.Since 1965 the program has provided remedial instruction in reading, language and math to low-income students. It currently covers more than five million students in two-thirds of the nation's schools. But in the last year, three separate studies have suggested changes to improve the program's success.Typically, students are pulled out of regular classes to attend remedial classes for 30 minutes. Too often, they then fall behind in their regular classes. The reports recommended fewer remedial classes and more emphasis in regular classes on critical thinking and analytical skills. They also suggested improvements in teacher training, student evaluations and health and social services for needy students.

1311	 2011	a	New York smells like many things, and some of them are good: freshly baked bagels, a beer and a dog at Yankee Stadium, the salt air that blows in on a summer morning.Of course, many New York smells are not so good. Feel free to think of some of your own least favorites.Though you would probably be hard pressed to come up with an official scent of New York, a state legislator from Staten Island, Matthew Titone, thinks he has: pine.Uli Seit for The New York TimesIn a press release on Friday (and yes, we realize it was April Fool’s Day, and the assemblyman’s office swore this was not a joke), Mr. Titone introduced legislation that would name pine as New York’s official state scent. He said that while New York had the usual official flower, tree, bird, fish and whatnot, we did not have a state scent. “And that stinks,” he said.Mr. Titone acknowledged that each New York community had its own smells, saying that his Staten Island constituents occasionally had to endure the odors of New Jersey. In choosing pine, however, he said he had found a unifying scent for the state, citing the pine barrens of Long Island, the Adirondack forests, and taxi air fresheners as his influences.“The pine tree, like New Yorkers who are known for their can-do attitude, takes root where it can,” Mr. Titone said in the release, “surviving and thriving.”Readers, we put it to you: Do you support Mr. Titone’s choice, or do you have your own ideas of what should be the state’s official scent?

4149	 1995	a	One day last week a visitor to the Metropolitan Museum found herself smiling back at a man who was gazing impishly, even flirtatiously, at her. He had curly hair, big eyes and was wearing what appeared to be a turtleneck sweater. His last name was Lesueur. His first she does not know, nor ever will. He died in 1876.Lesueur, an actor, was one of the many famous friends and acquaintances photographed, mostly in the mid-19th century, by a caricaturist and journalist who called himself Nadar and is now the subject of a major museum show. Nadar, a tall, burly man with hair that flies back from his face and a thick mustache, looks, in his self-portrait, like a handful. His wife, her eyes and lips narrowed and her body backing away from his camera, certainly seems to have thought so.In truth, Nadar may or may not have thrown off heat and his wife may or may not have frosted the air around her. Such speculation is based only on a long, luxurious scrutiny of their images -- luxurious because one cannot afford to stare too long at actuality. Actuality -- living, breathing people -- gets angry ("Why are you looking at me that way?") or defensive ("I didn't sleep last night") or snippy ("So rude!"). Images remain serene.Some photographs say more about their makers than they do of their subjects. And a photograph in a fashion magazine, however attractive the model, is meant to talk about what she, or he, is wearing. But the subject of a photograph by the Nadars of this world speaks to the viewer. Sometimes the viewer, like the woman who smiled at Lesueur, speaks back.
1127	 2012	a	For the past three and a half years, Republicans have struggled to explain a great conundrum. If they are the party of authentic America with a mystical connection to the will of the people, then how, exactly, did Barack Obama get elected president?Some Republicans have come up with an answer that allows them to avoid facing the unpleasant reality of their own party’s failures: Obama must be a great deceiver. He won the White House by subterfuge.Claims that Obama concealed nonnative birth or faith in Islam failed to gain mainstream traction, but conservatives like Sean Hannity were more successful in labeling Obama as covertly “anti-American” based on his association with the incendiary pastor the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. By this logic, Obama was a paragon of Christian piety. He “savored” every word on Sunday mornings and would surely govern by these traitorous principles: his beliefs were dangerous because, well, he really believed them.Now his critics have reversed course: they say Obama is a sham Christian. He thinks religion is not heartfelt belief that demands full expression, but only a matter of showing up at church. He is not the first president to stand so accused: in the election of 1800, one clergyman charged Thomas Jefferson with “disbelief of the Holy Scriptures,” and Abraham Lincoln battled the suggestion that he was a “scoffer of Christianity.”But Obama’s opponents have a new twist on this old allegation. They find evidence for his unbelief not by exposing his biblical illiteracy or shoddy church attendance, but in his failure to support “religious freedom.”Religious freedom is as American as apple pie, isn’t it? How could anyone oppose it? Because — this line of reasoning goes — Obama is not who he says he is. He claims to be a true Christian and a true American, but his actions prove otherwise.The charge that the president is a faker on religious freedom is the most recent iteration of the ongoing attack on his legitimacy: it is the new “birther” movement. It’s also a decades-old rhetorical tool of the culture wars intended to depict the entire left as frauds who supposedly stand for a tolerant open society, but who are in fact disciples of a secular pseudo-religion intent on quashing Christian influence in America.The Rev. Franklin Graham, who has always been more provocative than his prudent father Billy, told MSNBC last week that the president lacks sufficient outrage over the plight of persecuted Christians. “Islam has gotten a free pass under Obama,” Graham said, adding that the Muslim world sees Obama as “a son of Islam” who will not challenge religious oppression. “The Muslims of the world — he seems to be more concerned about them than the Christians that are being murdered in the Muslim countries – that’s what bothers me.” (Graham offered a half-apology on Tuesday, saying he regretted any comments that “cast any doubt on the personal faith of our president.”)During the recent outcry over the Obama administration’s new rule requiring religious employers to cover birth control in their insurance plans, Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney blasted the president too: here was proof of Obama’s aim to oppress religious expression and trample constitutional rights.Last week, at a rally at a Christian college in Michigan, Rick Santorum called the president “particularly weak” on religious freedom. He insisted that “freedom of religion” is much more than “freedom of worship” confined within a church’s four walls, which even “tyrants” support. “When you have the president of the United States referring to freedom of religion and you have the secretary of state referring to the freedom of religion, not as the freedom of religion but the freedom of worship, you should get very, very nervous,” he warned.When conservatives cry “freedom of religion” and insist they mean something more than “freedom of worship,” this is what they mean: religious freedom is not just the freedom to gather in a room and pray one morning a week. It is the freedom to impose one’s own religious values on others. Free expression of religion entails the right to reason from religious principles in the public square and — with sufficient electoral support — to enshrine those principles in law and social institutions. If Obama does not support this view, they argue, then he is hardly a true American.Over the course of American history, “religious freedom” has been a shape-shifter invoked just as often in the name of prejudice (in 19th-century Protestant campaigns against Catholic schools; in fundamentalist colleges’ racial discrimination a hundred years later) as on behalf of liberty. It is a code phrase alternately benign and sinister, much like that other clever cloak for bigotry, “states’ rights.” In the context of the 2012 race, the charge that Obama subverts religious freedom is a code meant to label the president as an impostor, a blasphemer of the American gospel who adheres to another religion entirely.Santorum has hit this theme the hardest, warning that conservative Christians must not be fooled by the president’s efforts to play the neutral statesman who treats all believers equally. On the contrary, he obeys a false religion with nonnegotiable assumptions of its own. Santorum described Obama’s environmentalism as a “phony theology” and a “worldview.”This is an attempt to paint as irrationally ideological a president who has proven himself to be not very ideological at all (much to the frustration of his supporters on the left). It is a culture warrior’s maneuver to cast American politics as a Manichean battleground between two worldviews — red-blooded Christian America pitted against the secularist stranger — worldviews so captive to their own logic that they cannot possibly compromise on anything.This obsession with “worldviews” has been a favorite tactic of the Christian right. In the 1970s, Francis Schaeffer and other activists taught evangelicals to organize against the “secular humanist worldview” that was denaturing America’s Christian values in an acid bath of “humanist religion,” “an exclusivist, closed system which shuts out all contending viewpoints” (that’s the “phony theology” that Santorum was talking about).Schaeffer’s admirers often note that he defends religious freedom in his 1981 book, “A Christian Manifesto.” But after Schaeffer called for “general religious freedom” for all faiths, he went on to lament the left’s manipulation of the First Amendment to encourage a “new concept of pluralism” in which “there is no right or wrong; it is just a matter of your personal preference.”To recover America’s biblical foundation, Christians had to “do battle on the entire front:” not just in church, but in the courts, classrooms, outside abortion clinics and everywhere else, Schaeffer wrote. The emerging Christian right asserted that this was the true meaning of “religious freedom” in America: freedom to institutionalize Christian dogma in American society and law. Freedom of religion — a phrase that sounds at first blush like a bipartisan nod to our common political heritage — is a weapon of culture war.Slogans like this have political power. Voters on both the right and the left have little sympathy for politicians who reason through problems and recognize ambiguity (conservatives won’t forgive Romney for his honest struggles with the abortion issue, and Obama faces liberal wrath for his nuanced approach to economic recovery). Wonkish debates are boring and complicated, and not very good for separating the sheep from the goats. What matters are your “presuppositions,” your “worldview.”Conservatives’ accusations that Obama disrespects religious freedom have little to do with the White House’s actual policy: his administration has a strong track record in supporting faith-based organizations and ensuring that prisoners have access to religious literature, for example. They have everything to do with resurrecting old challenges to the president’s legitimacy and framing the 2012 campaign as a battle between honest Christian Americans and atheist subversives. “Enemy of religious freedom” is shorthand for a deceiver who is not one of us: in Gingrich’s words, one who “played a wonderful con, as a result of which he is now president.”Molly Worthen teaches religious history at the University of Toronto.
643	 2015	a	WASHINGTON — A cinco meses de la cumbre de la ONU, donde se buscará forjar un acuerdo histórico para reducir las emisiones que causan el calentamiento climático, se empiezan a vislumbrar señales significativas de progreso.China, el mayor productor de gases de efecto invernadero en el mundo, presentó un plan de 16 páginas ante las Naciones Unidas el 30 de junio, en el cual detalla cómo planea cambiar su economía para reducir las emisiones de combustibles fósiles para el 2030. El mismo día, Dilma Rousseff, presidenta de Brasil, país que está entre los 10 principales emisores de carbono, y el Presidente Obama anunciaron en Washington que sus naciones habían acordado ampliar drásticamente la generación de electricidad con fuentes renovables.Pero cada vez es más evidente que las acciones por parte de estos y otros países no serán suficientes para evitar un aumento de la temperatura atmosférica de 2 grados Celsius, o 3,6 grados Fahrenheit. Cuando se llegue a ese momento, dicen los científicos, el planeta estará condenado a un futuro de tormentas extremas, sequías, escasez de alimentos y agua, y aumentos en el nivel del mar.Según lo acordado en la cumbre climática de las Naciones Unidas en Perú el pasado diciembre, cada país debe presentar un plan para reducir las emisiones de carbono antes de la cumbre de diciembre en París. Los planes de las naciones formarán el núcleo del nuevo acuerdo.Corea del Sur, Serbia e Islandia también presentaron sus planes para reducir las emisiones recientemente, uniéndose a los 40 o más países que ya lo habían hecho, incluyendo Canadá, México, Rusia, Estados Unidos y la Unión Europea.En un anuncio conjunto por Brasil y los Estados Unidos, los dos países se comprometieron a incrementar el uso de energía eólica, solar y geotérmica para que represente el 20 por ciento de la producción eléctrica de cada país en 2030, lo que duplicaría la generación de energía a partir de fuentes renovables en Brasil y la triplicaría en Estados Unidos. Brasil también se comprometió a recuperar unos 30 millones de acres de selva amazónica, un área aproximadamente del tamaño de Honduras.“Después del progreso alcanzado durante mis viajes a China y la India, queda demostrado que las principales economías del mundo pueden comenzar a trascender algunas de las viejas divisiones y trabajar conjuntamente para enfrentar el desafío común, algo en lo que tenemos que trabajar para nuestras generaciones futuras”, dijo Obama, quien ha impulsado a otros países a firmar un acuerdo sobre el cambio climático.Los expertos en política climática destacaron la importancia del plan de China. Estados Unidos y China, los principales emisores de gases de efecto invernadero del mundo, siempre han sido considerados como los mayores obstáculos para llegar a un acuerdo global significativo. Eso cambió en noviembre pasado cuando Obama y el Presidente Xi Jinping anunciaron conjuntamente que Estados Unidos reduciría sus emisiones hasta en un 28 por ciento desde los niveles de 2005 para el año 2025, mientras que las emisiones de China podrían alcanzar su punto máximo y luego declinar a más tardar en 2030.En marzo, Obama presentó un plan ante las Naciones Unidas que detalla cómo Estados Unidos alcanzarán su objetivo. El plan dice que lo harían principalmente a través de la promulgación de regulaciones de la Agencia de Protección Ambiental sobre las emisiones de automóviles, camiones y plantas eléctricas.El plan de China incluye un amplio compromiso para desligar el crecimiento económico del uso de los combustibles fósiles, y un movimiento para reducir su intensidad de carbono (la cantidad del contaminante generado por cada punto de crecimiento económico), en un 60 o 65 por ciento respecto a los niveles de 2005 para el año 2030. Asimismo expuso los planes para desarrollar un sistema nacional de topes y comercio, un programa en el que las empresas deben pagar permisos para contaminar y pueden comprar y vender dichos permisos entre sí.Brasil, a pesar de su reciente anuncio, aún no ha presentado su plan climático a las Naciones Unidas, al igual que otras economías importantes, como la India y Japón. En todo caso, los expertos dicen que lo más probable es que sus planes no serán lo suficientemente robustos para frenar los efectos nocivos del cambio climático.Negociadores de las Naciones Unidas dicen que ahora ven el acuerdo de París como el primer paso en un proceso de varios años en que los países impulsarán políticas climáticas nacionales y se reunirán regularmente para lograr planes más estrictos.

3992	 1996	a	No."You did not go through the proper channels for this request," replied Director Wang Shibang, a senior officer in the Fujian Province Public Security Bureau. "We were told that you were here to discuss immigration problems. If you want something else, you should go through proper channels."Captain Duke, on his first trip to China, was mystified by this kind of round-in-a-circle language, since he had asked from day one to meet local Fuzhou police. Two Chinese-American police officers on the trip, Sgt. Douglas Lee and Det. Hayman Goon, were equally at a loss.It was anyone's guess whether Director Wang was under orders from Beijing to block any new meetings, or was afraid to let even a small ray of sunlight into the murky operations of a police force that was a target of a corruption probe two years ago, or was just being a bureaucrat.At a final dinner, Captain Duke and Director Wang sat next to each other, but did not exchange a single sentence in an hour-long meal. Director Wang resisted when an American took a photo of those at the table, finally agreeing, but then changing his mind and demanding that the unexposed film be handed over. It was.Captain Duke said later that, despite the frustrations, the trip had been worthwhile. If a single life is saved through future cooperation between the two sides, he said, that would justify the effort and cost, under $20,000, shouldered by the N.Y.P.D."We came, we saw, we asked, we didn't get," said Captain Duke, 55, a beefy, gray-at-the-temples man, over a Tsingtao beer at a hotel bar where he and his colleagues spent their last evening chuckling about the week's misadventures. "That's life. It's their system here, their rules."Although they could not be sure, Captain Duke and his colleagues said they sensed that many of the police officials they met were nervous about setting up any formal cooperation with an American police department without a formal protocol or treaty.

1626	 2009	a	NEW ORLEANS — It is one thing to get the Alabama fans mad at you. It is quite another when the Alabama attorney general is mad and has the power to throw you in prison.Andre Smith, the Outland Trophy winner, has been suspended for the Sugar Bowl for what multiple news media outlets are reporting was improper contact with an agent. The Alabama attorney general’s office is investigating because the state has strict laws regarding sports agents and contact with amateur athletes. The offense is considered a felony.The story broke Monday when Coach Nick Saban announced Smith’s suspension and it did not take long for the Alabama attorney general to assign an investigator. Some news media outlets are reporting that a member of Smith’s family talked to the agent.The N.C.A.A. said it was not involved in the investigation and the university was handling the probe. That should not surprise critics of the N.C.A.A., who claim the governing body of college athletics has lost its teeth when it comes to chasing bad behavior by its members.This is bad news for the agent involved for several reasons. One is jail time and a hefty fine. Also consider that Alabama is going to have a slew of N.F.L.-type players in the program the next few seasons with Saban chasing the best of the best in recruiting. If an agent is responsible for Smith getting suspended, it is likely that agent and his agency will not have a chance at these Bama players.The last time Alabama had to play a game without Smith, its all-American left tackle, the Crimson Tide stumbled around on offense and beat Tulane, 20-6, in the third game of the season. Bama rushed for 130 yards. Alabama not only played without Smith, who led one of the best offensive lines in the country, it also played without right guard Marlon Davis. The sophomore David Ross will start against Utah at left guard and Mike Johnson will move from left guard to left tackle.Smith, by the way, told The Birmingham News he had not decided whether to turn pro or return for his senior season. Considering the life expectancy of knees in college football and the N.F.L., it is hard to believe Smith will not turn pro, especially if he is projected to go in the top five of the 2009 draft, as many expect.

Caivano/The Associated PressPARIS — It may be as difficult to believe for fans as it is for the Formula One teams and the media, but the 2012 season is really, finally, over.It was the longest season ever, with 20 races from March to the end of November, on every continent except Africa and Antarctica. I heard some fans say the season was too long. For many years the norm had been 16 races, which then crept up to 17, 18, 19. . . until we hit 20 this year. Personally, I don’t feel the season was too long. Nascar has twice as many races.The difference is that Nascar’s Sprint Cup races all take place in the United States, while the final third of the F1 season — from the Singapore Grand Prix in late September to the Brazilian Grand Prix last weekend — involved intensive travel from one time zone to another, from one part of the world to another, with no respite.The people who suffered the least through all that work, play and travel were the Formula One drivers. They are the first to admit that.To close out the season, there were three groups of three races one week apart, in different parts of the world — Japan and South Korea; India and Abu Dhabi; Texas and Brazil. Journalists and team members were counting the dead in the last few races — sorry, I mean, the ill and the wounded.At least one journalist was sent home after arriving in Texas and it was discovered that he had contracted malaria on the India trip. Two others were thought to have malaria and were sent to rest in the hospital or their hotels. They did not apparently have malaria or the more worrying dengue fever.PhotoThe word from teams and other support personnel was that the illness level was much higher this season than normal. I was told in Austin that the venerable Dr. Sid Watkins, Formula One’s great safety innovator who died in September, had once said that for a complete physical recovery, the human body needs a week for each time zone it crossed.Formula One personnel did not have that this year. My own travel schedule since early October: two weeks on the road, one week at home in Paris, two weeks on the road, one week at home, two weeks on the road.Am I complaining? No. But there were times when I knew my body was not finding the adequate time it needed to recover.The people who suffered the least through all that work, play and travel were the Formula One drivers. They are the first to admit that. Everything is done to protect their health, to give them sleep and a break. Having said that, Sebastian Vettel, the driver who won the title, spent a fortune to rent a private jet to take him to the final races in order to diminish the physical exhaustion and stress. Looks like it might have worked — his Abu Dhabi and Brazil races were brilliant.Having said that, on Thursday around 2 a.m., I noticed a fellow journalist suggesting that the results of the season might change due to a suspicion that Vettel had made an illegal move in Brazil. At first I thought it was a joke, that the journalist was just having some fun now that the season was over and he, like me, was getting back into the rhythm of daily life.But I found that Ferrari had indeed sent a letter asking the International Automobile Federation, the series’ governing body, to clarify why Vettel had not been penalized for a move that appeared to break the rules. Had Vettel been given the usual 20-second penalty, he would have dropped to eighth position, and the Ferrari driver, Fernando Alonso, would have won the driver’s title.After I read the F.I.A. explanation of what had happened on the track, it was clear that no rule had been broken. And when I saw that the F.I.A. had said all the teams and drivers had been educated in the correct way to deal with the electronic warning lights, it made me suddenly think that perhaps whoever asked for clarification at Ferrari was also just too exhausted from all that travel to have remembered the details.In the end, I learned that the only reason the whole issue came up was because fans had started showing videos on YouTube of the moment that Vettel had passed Jean-Eric Vergne. Ferrari had received thousands of queries from fans on why Vettel had not been penalized. So Ferrari sent an inquiry, the F.I.A. quickly gave an explanation, and Ferrari accepted it.It was interesting to see how the fans and YouTube can affect the climate surrounding the series. It was a season without major controversy — except for the Bahrain race — and the biggest controversy had suddenly come three days after the season ended, pumped up by media and fan sites.Among my articles reviewing the season, the main feature is an overview of the season; my Q&A with Bobby Epstein, the chairman of the Circuit of the Americas, where the U.S. Grand Prix ran in Austin two weeks ago. And this year, I decided to put together a look at the two finalists, Vettel and Fernando Alonso, not only because of their contrasting styles but also because they both deserved the title.

4024	 1996	a	Cecil Fielder, the Yankees' newest high-priced star, was not the most prolific run producer traded last night before the major league trading deadline. The San Diego Padres, seeking a power boost for their pennant run, grabbed Greg Vaughn, one of the American League's primary power hitters this season, from the Milwaukee Brewers.For Vaughn and a player to be named, the Padres gave the Brewers outfielder Marc Newfield and relief pitchers Ron Villone and Bryce Florie. The Padres acquired Newfield and Villone exactly one year ago from the Seattle Mariners for pitcher Andy Benes.The Mariners, active again on the last day players could be traded without waivers, picked up their second left-hander in two days. Joining Jamie Moyer as new members of the Mariners' starting rotation will be Terry Mulholland, whom Seattle got from Philadelphia for a minor league shortstop, Desi Relaford.The Texas Rangers, scrambling to stay ahead of the Mariners in the American League West, tried to bolster their relief corps with the addition of Mike Stanton, a left-hander, getting him from Boston for Mark Brandenburg, a rookie reliever, and Kerry Lacy, a minor league reliever.
741	 2014	a	TETENBAUM--Herbert, whose boyhood bout with oseomyelitis, a bone-marrow infection that sent him to the hospital for multiple surgeries as a child and engendered within him a lifelong reverence for the practice of medicine, died December 29, 2013 in Palm Desert, CA, after a short illness at the age of 92. A retired obstetrician-gynecologist long active in medical education, Dr. Tetenbaum had moved to the desert community from Long Beach, NY, six months earlier with Sylvia Tetenbaum (nee Balopole), his wife of 69 years, who survives him. He is also survived by his children, Barbara Shepard of Las Vegas, NV, wife of Curtis Shepard; Abraham Tetenbaum of Los Angeles, CA, husband of Elizabeth R. Shafer; and Zelda Yoder, Reading, PA, wife of Mark Yoder. Additionally, he is survived by seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Three sisters survive him: Esther Heller, Mildred Berwitz, and Gloria Gimbel. He was predeceased by a brother, T. Leonard Tetenbaum and a sister, Beverly Schneider. Herbert Tetenbaum was born on March 25, 1921, at Beth-El Hospital in Brooklyn, NY, which later became Brookdale Hospital Medical Center during the 41 years he served on its medical staff. He graduated from Chicago Medical School (CMS), which later grew to become Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science during his tenure on its Board of Trustees. Dr. Tetenbaum grew up in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, the third of six children of Eastern European immigrants, Isaac and Anna Tetenbaum. He worked at his father's dry goods store and attended Samuel J. Tilden High School where he led the swing band to a city championship. As "Ted Herberts," he played clarinet and saxophone at school dances and entertained at Catskill Mountains resorts during the summer. Dr. Tetenbaum attended the University of Texas at Austin where he majored in bacteriology, and drove the 1,750 miles back to Brooklyn every chance he got. He believed that attending school so far from home might give him an edge in applying to medical school as there were quotas in place restricting admissions for Jewish candidates from New York, but his admission was not immediate. Even the Army turned him down during World War II because of physical limitations resulting from his childhood operations. He worked in a defense plant before landing a job at the Rockefeller Institute in Manhattan as laboratory assistant to Dr. Karl Landsteiner, who in 1930 had won the Nobel Prize for discovering the blood groups. When Dr. Tetenbaum opened the letter that contained the news that he finally had been accepted to medical school, he was riding in a subway car with his girlfriend Sylvia, who exclaimed, "Now we can get married!" They sealed the bargain with a kiss and received a round of applause from their fellow passengers. Herb and Sylvia proved to be a formidable team in Chicago, together raising funds for the school, which attained its national accreditation the year he graduated. When they returned to Brooklyn and purchased their first home, which included an office for his general practice, the last thing in the world he expected was to be drafted. But the United States Army, now in need of physicians, had changed its mind and sent the growing Tetenbaum family to Fort Brooke in San Juan, Puerto Rico. There, by his own account, Dr. Tetenbaum attained the rank of Major, "fought the battle of the Officers Club" and acquired his medical specialty training. Back in Brooklyn, Dr. Tetenbaum became a Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American College of Surgeons, delivered thousands upon thousands of babies and remained deeply involved in the institutional lives of his school, hospital and various medical groups. For his tireless efforts on their behalf, he was showered with recognition in the form of dinners, tributes, awards, plaques, citations and statuettes. He especially prized his 1985 Distinguished Alumnus Award from Chicago Medical School where for several years he administered the Hippocratic oath to its graduating class. Dr. Tetenbaum earned the esteem and affection of all who knew him through loyalty, generosity, dedication, a Borscht Belt sense of humor and, when asked for it, sound advice. He lived to see his children's lives reflect his values. Barbara became a psychotherapist, Abraham a Broadway playwright and nonprofit executive, and Zelda an educator. His grandchildren and great-grandchildren gave him immense pleasure, and three family "convocations" on cruise ships were among the highlights of his later years. Dr. Tetenbaum was an avid music lover, theatergoer, horseback rider, reader, world traveler, extemporaneous speaker, mixologist and sports fan. He rooted for the home team, and when there was no home team, he rooted for the underdog. Having fulfilled his own dream, he encouraged and supported the aspirations of his family and friends. For someone who was not expected to make it out of childhood, he ended up touching and enriching countless lives.

3047	 2001	a	If I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard, Compaq Computer and computer companies like Dell Computer that build servers running Microsoft's NT operating system cannot slow the growth of the Sun Microsystems share of the server market in the first half of 2001, they may be looking at Sun's taillights for years to come.Sun's growth rests on its position as the clear market leader in the fast-growing server segment that uses Unix operating systems. Solaris, Sun's version of Unix, has achieved the enviable reputation of being the safest choice for information managers in a wide range of business environments, much as I.B.M. hardware was in the 1960's. The Unix market, led by Sun, has been so strong that Microsoft's much ballyhooed NT system has had a far harder time than analysts projected penetrating the business computing market.Sun gained its momentum during the late 1990's by being among the first computer companies to recognize the potential effect of the Internet. By designing server computers that bundle up to 64 processors and by working to make sure customers had access to plenty of reliable system management software, Sun vaulted past competitors like Compaq and Hewlett-Packard. Only I.B.M. now stands ahead of it in total revenue in the $60 billion worldwide server market.So many features go into measuring a server's capabilities that comparisons are always tricky. Many analysts believe, though, that Sun's delays in rolling out its new Ultrasparc III processor have given competitors a rare window for counterattack in 2001. The new processor began appearing in smaller servers in 2000 but may not ship in Sun's top-of-the-line refrigerator-size E10000's before next summer. By then, Sun's high-end customers will have been relying on its current generation of Ultrasparc processors since 1997, ancient times in the computer world.

3296	 2000	a	The audience and the temperature had fallen precipitously since their last meeting, but the United States and China played another riveting match in women's soccer early yesterday morning in Canberra, Australia. Again, the match was decided by penalty kicks. This time, however, China prevailed.Four minutes from the end of regulation, the Chinese forward Sun Wen got tangled with defender Danielle Slaton and the two fell down in the penalty area. China was awarded a penalty kick, and Sun calmly placed her shot in the upper right corner for a 1-0 victory.The last time these teams played, July 10, 1999, they drew the largest audience ever to watch a women's sporting event -- 90,185 at the Rose Bowl for the final of the Women's World Cup. This match, held in the first round of the Pacific Cup tournament, was played before an estimated 550 fans. And those summer temperatures that had risen above 100 degrees on the Rose Bowl turf had dipped to freezing in the Southern Hemisphere's late autumn. JERE LONGMAN
1990	 2007	a	Former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is getting support from some high-flying financiers as he considers whether to run for president in 2008. Data published on Wednesday by PoliticalMoneyLine.com show that contributors to Mr. Giuliani’s presidential exploratory committee, formed in November, include T. Boone Pickens, the Texas mogul who runs the hedge fund BP Capital Management; and Paul Tudor Jones II, the chairman of the hedge fund Tudor Investment Corporation. The fund also got money from Carl C. Icahn, the billionaire investor, filings show.Mr. Pickens and Mr. Jones were ranked No. 2 and No. 5, respectively, in Alpha magazine’s listing of the most highly paid hedge fund managers of 2005. Mr. Icahn is one of the best-known activist investors on Wall Street.Mr. Pickens, Mr. Jones and Mr. Icahn each gave $2,100 to the fund, called the Rudy Giuliani Presidential Exploratory Committee, according to PoliticalMoneyLine. (Update: Under campaign finance law at the time of these donations, $2,100 was the maximum an individual could contribute to a candidate in a single election.)Mr. Giuliani drew a lot of financial support from Mr. Pickens’ Dallas-based firm, BP Capital. Employees there contributed a total of $18,900 to his exploratory fund.Elliott Associates, a hedge fund founded by Paul E. Singer, one of Mr. Giuliani’s primary fund-raisers, has also been one of Mr. Giuliani’s biggest supporters. Employees of Elliott Associates gave a combined $14,700 to the fund, filings show.In all, Mr. Giuliani’s fund said it raised about $1.4 million between Nov. 15 and Dec. 31.In a Jan. 25 article, The New York Times’s Landon Thomas Jr. wrote about the increasing importance of hedge fund money for those with political aspirations:Hedge fund money, which now exceeds $1 trillion, has emerged in the last several years as a potentially powerful force in politics, as underscored by the significant role it is playing in the presidential aspirations of [Hillary Rodham] Clinton and Mr. Giuliani. During the 2006 election cycle, executives who work at the 30 biggest hedge funds made $2.8 million in contributions to political candidates or party committees, almost double the amount in 2000. Yet it is not just the money they donate directly that makes people in hedge funds attractive to campaigns. They also offer access to other potential donors in the financial world, which in recent election cycles has become one of the biggest sources of political contributions.Go to Report from PoliticalMoneyLine.com »Go to Previous Article from The New York Times »Go to Related Article from the Associated Press via The New York Times »
7454	 1964	a	LOS ANGELES, May 31 Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona said today that he, would call a “summit conference” of Republican leaders of all stripes of opinion if he won the Presidential nomination.In a written statement from Washington, the Senator said the conference would discuss “both the tactics and strategy for a Republican victory in 1964.”Mr. Goldwater said he would invite Governor Rockefeller, his opponent in the California Republican Presidential primary Tuesday, to such a meeting. He said he would also invite former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, former Vice President Richard M. Nixon, Senator Everett McKinley Dirksen of Illinois, the Senate minority leader, Representative Charles Halleck of Indiana, the House minority leader, Gov. William W. Scranton of Pennsylvania and Gov. George Romney of Michigan and others.Mr. Goldwater said he was suggesting a meeting to promote party unity after what has been a bitter series of primary campaigns.

1604	 2010	a	To call someone a conspiracy theorist is, in truth, to say something insultingly vague, because as we all know conspiracy theorists come in degrees. On the one hand are the elite squad of paranoids who keep 10 years’ worth of kidney beans in their basements, bite their nails and believe that the North Koreans are lacing our club soda with something dangerously nonnutritive. On the other hand are the languorous crackpots who wonder if codes are embedded in their Home Depot receipts, or if George Washington’s wooden leg hid an alternate Constitution. It is for this group that the series “Brad Meltzer’s Decoded” has been conceived.If you need to ask, “Who is Brad Meltzer?,” then “Decoded” (starting Thursday on History) isn’t for you. It is a series for those who already share his affinities for pyramid symbols, secret societies, puzzles, missing artifacts, Washington tombs, underground labyrinths, stealth agendas of the founding fathers and so on. They are interests that Mr. Meltzer has made well known in his best-selling novels: legal thrillers with an archival fetish largely devoid of subtext and meant for consumption between Dulles and O’Hare. These are books for which there are television commercials.The latest, “The Inner Circle,” due next month, is fairly representative of the canon. In it a young government librarian gets into trouble when he shows a pretty girl where the president privately studies classified documents. They accidentally discover a 200-year-old dictionary that lands them, as the book jacket denotes, “in a web of deception, conspiracy, and murder that will reveal the best-kept secret of the U.S. presidency.”PhotoA dictionary! How quaintly pre-yellowcake! And yet it is this same spirit of irrelevance that animates — or, more accurately, enervates — Mr. Meltzer’s television venture. Each episode of “Decoded” seeks to unravel some sort of historical mystery in a key that is something close to “Lost” meets a seventh-grade civics lesson. Mr. Meltzer, bald and laboring to seem professorial, narrates while standing, inexplicably, in front of a chalk board emblazoned with math equations as if he were auditioning for a remake of “A Beautiful Mind” or impersonating Glenn Beck.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyHis team, meanwhile, is dispatched to do the nitty-gritty work of investigating — digging around in vaults and asking the tough questions. In the premiere these questions are posed to Freemasons and the people who think about them. “What are they hiding?” Christine McKinley, a mechanical engineer, asks a filmmaker with expertise in weird brotherhoods. “Their ultimate agenda, which is the new world order,” he answers.

4498	 1993	a	Of all the questions surrounding the case of Joel Rifkin, who is accused of killing 17 women, the first quandary prosecutors must resolve is this: Who will get the first crack at convicting him?Legal experts say the case is a jurisdictional morass involving nine counties in the New York region, since the authorities have said Mr. Rifkin killed most of the women in Manhattan and dumped their bodies in rivers and woods in a wide area from eastern Suffolk County to northern Putnam County. The state police are coordinating the murder investigations, but a month after Mr. Rifkin's arrest, a squadron of prosecutors is still trying to resolve where he will be tried and in what order to bring the cases.Prosecutors say they want to make sure that the first case tried is the strongest, since an acquittal in the first trial could weaken all the other cases. It is also important that they gain more than one conviction, they say, to make it virtually certain that Mr. Rifkin, a 34-year-old unemployed landscaper, will never be paroled. Lure of Praise and PublicityAnd, of course, the prosecutor who wins the first case against Mr. Rifkin will reap the greatest windfall of praise and publicity. While none will say so publicly, the prosecutors themselves admit that they are extremely reluctant to yield authority in high-profile cases in which a conviction is certain to burnish their reputations.

96	 2019	a	ISTANBUL — Even before he began his first day at work as Istanbul’s new mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu was being talked about as the man who could challenge President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the leadership of Turkey in four years’ time.For the moment he is avoiding the question, and insists that he will concentrate for the next five years on serving Istanbul, a sprawling metropolis of 15 million inhabitants, a quarter of whom live below the poverty line.“Right now I am a person who is fully concentrated on governing,” he told foreign journalists at a news briefing on his first day in office last Friday. “But if there are those who see our star high in the sky, we thank them.”There is no doubt that he presents a broader threat to the president. Mr. Imamoglu said he fully intended to use the enormous popular support that elected him by a surprisingly wide margin in a rerun on June 23 as a mandate to push back against Mr. Erdogan’s authoritarianism and bring democracy and fairness to all of Turkey.
3118	 2001	a	The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit yesterday denied requests, at least for now, by four New York City politicians to be freed on bail, as they continued to appeal convictions on charges that they trespassed on a federal military installation on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques. The four men demonstrated against Navy bombing exercises there last month.Lawyers for the four -- the Rev. Al Sharpton, City Councilman Adolfo Carrión Jr., Assemblyman José Rivera and Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic Party chairman -- said yesterday that they still hope to persuade the court in Boston to approve their release on bail. But the preliminary order suggested that the so-called Vieques Four could end up serving out their whole terms of 90 days for Mr. Sharpton and 40 days for the other three.''I am stunned,'' said Max D. Stern, a Boston lawyer aiding in Mr. Sharpton's appeal. ''They are no more danger to the community than was Rosa Parks when she committed her act of civil disobedience.''All four announced plans this week to begin liquid-only hunger strikes during their detention at a federal jail in Brooklyn, as a way to sustain their protest against the Navy's use of a bombing range on Vieques.

2601	 2004	a	We all nurture our ''own unique image for purity,'' according to a brochure for ''Whiteout,'' an exhibition at Felissimo Design House, 10 West 56th Street, that includes ''Used and Abused'' porcelain cups, $17 each, above. And white, of course, symbolizes purity.But which white?Two museums, two answers. ''We were looking for something neutral,'' said Jennifer Sage, of Sage & Coombe, the architect for the renovation of the Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum, 32-37 Vernon Boulevard in Long Island City, Queens. Her firm's choice: Benjamin Moore Regal Wall Satin in Super White ($22.59 a gallon). At the Museum of Modern Art, scheduled to reopen in November, the search for the right white was complicated by reflections from the new wooden floors, which made some whites look tan on the ceilings. The Modern chose Janovic Super White -- mostly latex interior flat ($19.59 a gallon), but occasionally a Janovic eggshell. ''The eggshell finish in the Benjamin Moore went way green,'' said Jerome Neuner, the Modern's director of exhibition design and production.

3864	 1997	a	The ODC/San Francisco modern dance troupe clearly spent a great deal of time and money on ''Outawak,'' a spectacular, multimedia computer fable that opened on Tuesday for a week's engagement at the Joyce Theater. Dancers spill out across a set-strewn stage dressed in a variety of costumes whose bright colors give the dancers the look of Liquorice Allsorts. There are scrims and screens galore, on which are projected bridges, a church steeple, clouds and members of the cast. And ''Outawak'' is a noble attempt to create a piece for the entire family, which seems to be one mission of the ODC troupe.The title says a great deal, however, about the level of wit in this eveninglong work, choreographed by Brenda Way and Kimi Okada to music by Paul Dresher and Bruce Barthol. ''Outawak'' was inspired by the teen-age son of one of the choreographers and by Norton Juster's ''Phantom Tollbooth,'' a children's book that shares the dance's tone of cool disengagement. The plot is familiar, and ''Outawak'' slips quickly through its points about language and learning. So it's hard to imagine the very young or the more sophisticated young audience finding the piece the solidly entertaining, and even provocative, theater experience its creators seem to be aiming for.''Outawak'' tells the story of Cosmo, a typically tuned-out teen-ager, who falls into cyberspace and a series of misadventures in the divided city of Wak. Cosmo is quickly recruited into the B-9 squad, a group of resistance fighters seeking to make peace between the forces of Numeragua and Verbia, committed, respectively, to order and logic and to expressive passion. Along the way Cosmo meets Molly XYZ, a pretty, ferocious member of B-9, and a host of nutty characters with names like Hopping Hindsight, Nuances of Narrowness, Raging Hormone and Crippling Rigidity, several of whom resemble the parents and sisters he left behind. After many chases, arrests and melees, Cosmo discovers Balance, the key to peace, and reunites the warring factions.Not all of this is clear. But Daniel Levi-Sanchez, who plays Cosmo, has a serenity and sweetness that acts as ballast in the storm. The cheerful, hard-working cast also included Shannon Mitchell, Kevin Ware, Patricia Jiron, Karina Richter, Damon White and Heather Tietsort in lead roles. The sets and lighting were by Alexander V. Nichols, with costumes by Barbara Bandy and Estelle Akamine. The film was by Wendy Slick, and the slide designs were by Mr. Nichols and Larry Ackerman. Live music, including rapping, was provided by the Paul Dresher Ensemble Electro-Acoustic Band.

4361	 1994	a	"What you can't do," he said, "is offer explicit evidence that you will engage in homosexual acts."Mr. McGuire said the ruling could have a great effect on the Clinton policy. "The question is, Will the new policy still be constitutional, given the reasoning in this decision," he said. "This decision says it is improper for the Government to make a presumption that a person who says he or she is gay will conduct himself or herself in prohibited conduct. That presumption is the linchpin for the Clinton Administration policy."The author of today's opinion was Judge Pamela Ann Rymer, an appointee of President George Bush. Joining her in the unanimous ruling were Judge Otto R. Skopil Jr., who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter, and Judge David R. Thompson, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan.The Justice Department has vigorously defended the Government's position in cases involving the old regulations, which explicitly barred service by homosexuals, because in some ways they are similar to the new rules, which were adopted in December and went into effect in February.The new policy, a compromise that evolved after Mr. Clinton vowed to lift unconditionally the military ban on homosexuals but met stiff resistance from the Pentagon and Congress, allows homosexuals to serve and ends a longstanding practice of asking new recruits their sexual orientation and aggressively pursuing investigations of those suspected of being gay.But the Clinton Administration policy, while it seeks to distinguish between conduct and orientation, seems to continue the old practice of discharging those who declare themselves to be gay, as in the cases of Mr. Meinhold and Mr. Steffan.Any officer of the rank of major or higher can embark on an investigation leading to discharge proceedings against someone for a homosexual act, a homosexual marriage or a homosexual statement "demonstrating a propensity or intent to engage in a homosexual act."And the one court challenge so far filed under the new rules, in Federal court in Brooklyn, involves six plaintiffs from different branches of service who contend that their only offense was in declaring themselves homosexuals. The Justice Department will file a brief in that case on Friday, which will be the Government's first official defense of the Clinton policy.

1197	 2012	a	SAN FRANCISCO — The success of Matt Harvey in his first two major leagues starts has some wondering whether Zack Wheeler, the Mets’ other coveted pitching prospect, might also make an appearance in the big leagues this year.But Manager Terry Collins said that it seemed an unlikely outcome for Wheeler, who was only just promoted to Class AAA on Wednesday afternoon.“I’m anxious to see Zack Wheeler pitch,” Collins said. “Will it be this year? I would doubt it.”Wheeler has gone 10-6 with a 3.26 earned run average and 117 strikeouts in 19 Class AA starts this year.Collins said the decision was General Manager Sandy Alderson’s to make. But he speculated that the high number of innings Wheeler would pitch by the time September comes would preclude him from a call-up. Wheeler has pitched 116 innings already.“I’m sure there’s a lot of that being talked about in the organization,” Collins said. “This guy’s already at more innings than he’s thrown in the past. I’d be surprised if we see him in September.”Collins has not seen Wheeler pitch since spring training. But he has been hearing positive reports on him.“Everybody’s raving about his stuff,” Collins said. “It’s the same thing with all young pitchers. He’s got to command it.”
4033	 1996	a	I want balance. I want fairness and I'm not finding it. That's a problem in many areas -- the judicial, legislative and executive branches. People have to force change and stop saying they can't make a difference. The so-called silent majority are people making less money, their quality of life is less. They're doing exactly what the Governor says they should do, working two, three and four jobs.Q. Is the solution to create new jobs?A. No! We should share in productivity.Productivity is at an all-time high. What made this country great was when we went from a 12-hour day, 7 days a week, to reducing our work day and reducing our work week. We abolished child labor. We shared in productivity.We believe in capital and that business has a right to profit. We also believe as workers that we are part of and deserve to share in that productivity. How do you do that? With higher wages or fewer hours.What we're seeing is the stock market at an all-time high, corporate salaries at an all-time high and corporate profits at an all-time high but we see stagnation. In fact, we see a reduction in real purchasing power. We are 16th in wages in the world.Q. Are immigrant workers taking American jobs?A. Business is trying to turn us against each other. Those people are not our enemy. To think that my misery, my problems are because of the guy over here is wrong.There's a certain amount of racism here. We are concerned about the Mexican border or about who's coming into Florida. When is the last time anyone complained about illegal Irish immigrants? Whether we be Irish, Polish, African-American or Hispanic, we are not each other's enemies. This is a country that can continue to accept people. Rather than working three or four jobs, maybe the new immigrant can have one of those jobs.Q. And the jobs that are lost to foreign factories?A. If we're going to be a superpower, a morally responsible player in the world scene, then we have to recognize that we cannot exploit other people and have a safe and good world for ourselves and our sons and daughters.

1861	 2008	a	Not so long ago, auctions for two-year-olds in training were a way for breeders to dispose of the horses they’d been unable to sell as yearlings and that they thought weren’t good enough to take to the races themselves. Today, those sales are a legitimate source of Derby contenders.This year, 6 of the 20 Kentucky Derby entrants — Big Brown, Court Vision, Recapturetheglory, Visionaire, Denis of Cork and Big Truck — were sold as two-year-olds at auction (for an average price of just over $219,000), and another — Cool Coal Man — went through the auction ring but didn’t meet his reserve price and went unsold on a final bid of $850,000.So, with 35 percent of the Derby entrants, two-year-old sales are definitely a fixture at even the highest levels of racing. This year’s field, in fact, is pretty evenly divided among three categories: homebreds, which are raced by their breeders; horses that sold as yearlings, and those who went through the two-year-old sales. So far, only one two-year-old sales graduate, Monarchos, has won the Derby, but more are sure to come.Traditionally, the best racehorses were either homebreds or sold as yearlings, initially at the glamorous Saratoga summer sales and later at the high-rollers’ convention that is the Keeneland sale. The occasional big horse was auctioned as a two-year-old. For example, Sir Barton, the first Triple Crown winner in 1919, was sold the previous year for $10,000. But until the 1950s, there were no organized, recurring juvenile auctions. In 1952, Joe O’Farrell, the founder of Ocala Stud, and Humphrey Finney of the Fasig-Tipton auction company put on the first two-year-olds in training sale at Hialeah Park near Miami, then the site of the premier winter race meet.At first, these sales were minor events, compared with the yearling auctions. But then, in the 1980s, as yearling prices soared, and foreign buyers became prominent in the U.S. market, the two-year-old sales started to take off, at first in California, where Japanese buyers regularly took home good North American-bred horses, and then later in Florida, especially in the mid-1990s, after Fasig-Tipton began its February two-year-old sale at Calder Race Course in Miami. That’s the sale that accounted for the most expensive horse ever sold at auction, the $16 million colt, named The Green Monkey, who eventually raced three times with not a single win before being retired. Other “select” sales at Ocala and Keeneland followed.As the importance of these sales grew, so did the role of “pinhookers,” who buy yearlings and then train them over the winter in Florida and sell them as two-year-olds. And so has the importance of the “breezes,” when these young horses run an eighth or a quarter of a mile before the sale. A difference of a few fifths of a second in a breeze time can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars when the horse enters the auction ring, and the difference between profit or loss for the pinhooker who risked millions buying those yearlings.Horses at the sales routinely run an eighth of a mile in 10 seconds flat, with the occasional breeze in 9.8 seconds, which will bring the seller millions. That’s a lot faster than horses run in races, and no indicator at all of how they might do going a mile and a quarter in May of their three-year-old year. If you go to the breeze shows before the sales, you’ll see dozens of trainers and bloodstock agents clocking not just the breeze, but also the “gallop out,” how the horse runs for the eighth or quarter of a mile after the wire. Not to mention the extra-slow-motion videos that the truly serious buyers and agents use, the vet exams, heart scans and similar attempts to separate the very best from the merely good.The pressure on fast times — horses in the sales breeze faster than they will ever run in a race — leads to pressure on the pinhookers to have their horses as ready as possible. And that, in turn, leads to some questionable practices. To be ready to breeze fast, horses have to be trained hard through the winter before the sales. Many thoroughbreds just aren’t physically or mentally mature enough to stand up to that tough training, even if they might have turned out to be fine race horses given a bit more time. In fact, to pick up on a point Jim Squires made on this blog a few days ago, more and more of the horses that appeared at the sales seem to have been given steroids, often resulting a shock for the buyer, when he took the horse home from the sale and it rapidly lost all the glorious muscle tone that had been in evidence in the auction ring. The sales companies have now instituted testing for steroids, but only this year.If Big Brown, or one of the other two-year-old sale graduates wins the Derby, you can look for even more attention to those sales in the future.Steve Zorn is managing partner of Castle Village Farm, a New York-based racing partnership, and also a member of the Board of Directors of the New York Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association.

4440	 1993	a	"After that fight, I had an itch on my back and I couldn't scratch it," McGirt said, smiling. "Now I can scratch it. I can go. I'll go till my shoulder falls off."Buddy McGirt is a trendy throwback. He arrived at Bufano's in a black homburg and a long fur coat. But after he walked up the rickety stairs into the second-floor shadows, he was transformed into a fighter out of a 1940's black-and-white movie. Sitting alone on a wooden bench in front of dusty gray-metal lockers behind two battered pool tables littered with newspapers, he changed into boxing gear not much different from that of other gladiators who trained here in other years: Chuck Wepner, Frankie De Paula, Rubin (Hurricane) Carter, even Sonny Liston once.In his work clothes now, McGirt moved into the big bright room that the ring all but filled, the early afternoon light flowing through five bare windows. He sat on a chair as Certo wrapped the hands that have produced a 59-2-1 record with 44 knockouts.Other than Chavez, not many boxers have that many fights anymore. Not the good ones anyway. With million-dollar paydays, the good ones stop boxing sooner now. Or will stop sooner. Whitaker has a 31-1 record with 15 knockouts. But will he endure until he's had 60 fights? Unlikely. Other than Chavez, how many of today's fighters have had 60 fights?"Wimpy Halstead," McGirt said. "Buck Smith."Halstead is an Oklahoma heavyweight with some 90 fights, Smith an Arkansas middleweight with more than 100 fights. But if the tendinitis in his left shoulder continues to bother him, how many more punches are there in 29-year-old Buddy McGirt's hands?How many more moves are there in McGirt's brain, which absorbed lessons from the old-timers who visited Al Certo's custom tailor store in nearby Secaucus."I'd listen to them talking among themselves -- Willie Pep, Jersey Joe Walcott, Joey Giardello," he said. "I remember hearing that boxing is a lot of obstacles, that you got to be strong to put up with the obstacles: the training, the fights that don't come off."

4004	 1996	a	Consumers and businesses in New York City are overcharged hundreds of millions of dollars a year because of the grip that organized crime has on the city's vital functions, from garbage collection to the wholesale food markets. Thus it is a salutary development that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his administration have begun working with Federal and local prosecutors to do something at last about a huge problem that has long been dismissed as beyond anyone's control.Two events occurred last week that illustrate the city's new aggressive approach. First, the Mayor joined with the City Council leadership to support legislation imposing strict rules on four major wholesale produce and meat markets similar to the ones put in place last year at the Fulton Fish Market. Legislation before the Council would give the Mayor authority to require background and fingerprint checks on merchants, employees and unions at markets that generated nearly $2.6 billion in sales last year. Second, a Federal judge declined to issue a temporary restraining order sought by commercial garbage haulers against similar background checks and regulation in their industry.Mr. Giuliani, who prosecuted many mob leaders when he was a United States Attorney, moved to City Hall at a time when many experts had begun to realize that prosecuting individual mobsters was not sufficient to get organized crime out of legitimate businesses. Too often, when top crime figures were indicted or convicted, they were simply replaced by others who kept the corruption going.The first organized-crime target Mr. Giuliani went after was the Fulton Fish Market, where kickbacks and extortion were a way of life. The approach there at first led to protests and job actions that disrupted commerce, but the market appears to have returned to normal. The model of requiring background checks and regulating activities at the market was extended to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and the San Gennaro festival in Little Italy, and the law requiring similar checks for the carting industry took effect last month.

It's possible we'll bring in another one, and we'll zero in on that more."Washington completed its dominating night with Chip Lohmiller's 35-yard field goal in the third quarter, a 27-yarder in the fourth quarter and Earnest Byner's 7-yard run on a sprint draw in the final quarter.The victory was Washington's ninth in the last 12 regular-season meetings with Philadelphia, and sixth in the last seven over all against the Eagles, including the 20-6 playoff victory in Philadelphia last season.The Redskins missed a chance to score on their first possession, but their defense continually gave their offense good field position. That persistence helped Washington build a 10-0 halftime lead.The half would not end, however, without several unusual twists and turns. With 1:39 remaining, Green intercepted a Ryan pass and returned it to the Philadelphia 28. One play and 12 seconds later, Rypien, under pressure, was apparently intercepted while trying to throw the ball away. His low toss to the left sideline was scooped up by linebacker Byron Evans, who sped to the Washington 28. But replay officials reversed the call, saying Evans had trapped the ball. This One CountedOn the next play, Rypien again was intercepted, and this time no replay was needed. His pass bounced off receiver Gary Clark's right shoulder and into linebacker Seth Joyner's hands at the Philadelphia 34. But the Eagles' offense labored, forcing Philadelphia to punt, and Washington left the half unscathed.Clark had beaten Allen on a 75-yard pass play on Washington's first possession. From the Washington 18, Rypien threw the ball 45 yards but short of Clark, who had been speeding down the left sideline. Clark slowed down to make the catch while Allen's momentum prevented him from staying close. Clark raced to his right, across the field and was finally tackled by cornerback Izel Jenkins at the 7. Three plays later, Allen redeemed himself by intercepting a Rypien pass in the end zone, this time stepping in front of Clark to make the play.
1762	 2009	a	Michel Euler/Associated Press Michel Euler/Associated Press Marina Zenovich, the director of the HBO documentary “Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired,” said Thursday that she was “perplexed by the timing” of remarks by David Wells, a former deputy district attorney who said in her film that he had coached the judge presiding over Mr. Polanski’s 1978 trial, but who now says he made it all up.In a statement, Ms. Zenovich said that since June of 2008, her film “has been quite visible on U.S. television via HBO, in theaters and on DVD, so it is odd that David Wells has not brought this issue to my attention before.”She added:“For the record, on the day I filmed Mr. Wells at the Malibu Courthouse, February 11, 2005, he gave me a one-hour interview. He signed a release like all my other interviewees, giving me permission to use his interview in the documentary worldwide. At no time did I tell him that the film would not air in the United States. “Mr. Wells was always friendly and open with me. At no point in the four years since our interview has he ever raised any issues about its content. In fact, in a July 2008 story in The New York Times, Mr. Wells corroborated the account of events that he gave in my film. “I am astonished that he has now changed his story. It is a sad day for documentary filmmakers when something like this happens.”More on Roman Polanski.

71	 2019	a	Even though it has been a few years since Stephen Colbert stepped out of the blowhard conservative-pundit role that he played for nearly a decade on “The Colbert Report” and into the role of, well, himself, as host of “The Late Show” on CBS, the 55-year-old’s popularity only continues to grow. His show, already No. 1 in late night, took over the top spot among viewers ages 18 to 49 earlier this year, a demographic that had long been owned by Jimmy Fallon and “The Tonight Show.” As it turns out, what Colbert and his show offer — an “explicative deconstruction of the day’s news,” as he puts it — is exactly what many people want. “It’s so confusing today,” said Colbert, who is also an executive producer on Showtime’s animated comedy “Our Cartoon President.” “And that confusion leads to anxiety, and the anxiety makes the audience want the jokes.” Which, Colbert added, is “the same reason we want to do them.”“The Late Show” is doing very well, and there are obvious explanations you could point to: You’ve had a few years to learn how to do the job. You’re benefiting from a Trump bump. But what’s your own hunch about why the show is resonating? By the spring of 2016, we had figured out how I want to do a monologue: We never do setup, punch, setup, punch. Instead, it’s always, I’m going to tell back to you what happened today. When the presidential campaign came around in 2016, that helped focus us on the things that we most enjoyed, which is the news of the day. But you say “doing very well,” and I know you mean numerically.1 This is a long preamble to the real answer to your question: It’s almost as if the president is trying to cast a spell to confuse people so they cannot know the true nature of reality, and what we do is pick apart the way in which the [expletive] was sold to you. I think that’s why it’s going well. Our job is to identify the [expletive], and there’s never been more.I remember Jon Stewart2 saying, when he was on “The Late Show,” that he was glad he wasn’t digging in the turd mines anymore. Is it ever dispiriting to spend so much time engaging with bad news? The metaphor that I use is that there’s this pool of radioactive sludge, which is the daily news. My job is to be lowered like carbon rods into that radioactive sludge and absorb the radiation of the insanity that happened today. Then they take me out and put me in front of the camera, and I irradiate it back at the audience at a much lower, nonlethal rad level. That’s kind of the job. It’s a transformation of the poison into something entertaining. Do I feel poisoned by doing that? Yeah, a little bit. But I get to go do the jokes. I need the audience as much as some of them say they need the show. If the show really works and it feels organic, then the poison’s drained out of me.Donald Trump discussing his presidential campaign on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” in September 2015. Jeffrey R. Staab/CBS, via Getty ImagesThe suggestion there is that comedy or satire can relieve people’s tension or anxiety about the world. But as far as I can tell, no one is feeling any less tense or anxious. Do you really think the show actually performs a stress-relieving function? Momentarily. You know, my doctor has informed me that if I could drink less during the week, that would be good. Because that would be one of the things I would want to do when I go home: have myself an old-fashioned that could stun a buffalo. It’s relaxing at first, but your blood pressure actually goes up again the next day because you drank four ounces of Maker’s Mark the night before.If we take that as a metaphor, where do you fit in it? I’m the alcohol. I might be the alcohol. I don’t know what the next day is like for anybody. If the show goes well, maybe the audience sleeps a bit better. And maybe that’s all the show should be. I have said this before, but I know that when you’re laughing, you’re not afraid.Is that true, though? Isn’t nervous laughter a laughter that comes from fear? Nervous laughter is not the same thing as laughing, in my opinion. I would say nervous laughter is evidence that I’m right, because that is your body autonomically trying to relieve tension. If someone can do that for you from the outside, it relieves that tension and fear, and you are momentarily not afraid. If you’re not afraid, you can think, and we have to think our way out of this one.Colbert, Ed Helms, Jon Stewart, Rob Corddry and Samantha Bee of “The Daily Show With Jon Stewart.” Comedy Central/PhotofestThis is bringing a line back to me that you had on election night in 2016, in that lovely monologue you gave. You said something like “the devil cannot stand mockery.”3 Right. Exactly.I’m cynically wondering where the evidence is for that. People were making fun of every tyrant who has ever lived. Now, wait a second. You’re implying that I am saying that satire can affect politics. I will merely paraphrase Peter Cook, who said that the greatest satire of the 20th century were the Weimar cabarets, and they stopped Hitler in his tracks. I have never ever claimed that it has any effect. I have never had any illusion that what I am doing is changing the world. We do it late at night, and maybe you sleep better because of it. As a child, comedy did that for me. I lost my father and two of my brothers when I was a child.4 I was absolutely leveled. But every night I went to sleep listening to George Carlin’s “Class Clown,” “Wonderfulness” by Bill Cosby, “Richard Nixon: A Fantasy,” by David Frye. Then later Steve Martin, “A Wild and Crazy Guy” and “Let’s Get Small.” Comedy allowed me to go to bed. It gave me a moment of release and happiness. I know that’s true. That’s not the same as saying that you stop tyrants.Is President Trump good for comedy? How do you come up with a fresh joke about him? I make no claim that we do. Sometimes it’s the same joke. But sometimes there’s still meat left on that chicken. Trump consumes the news cycle, and our mandate, as we’ve established for ourselves, is that I want to inform the audience of my opinion about what they’ve been thinking about all day. So if the news has been Orange Thanos, then I’m not going to change that. I’m going to do my best to stand in the teeth of that particular [expletive] hurricane and make jokes about how we’re all being lied to. For my own heart’s ease, I’m not going to pretend that Trump is not lying to me. The alternative is to stick your head in the sand.That thing about not wanting to let Trump get away with a lie — is it fair to say that you feel a moral imperative behind your work? Well, when you make jokes about politicians, there’s what they say and what they do. It’s hard to make jokes about someone who says something and then kind of does it. But with a guy who points east with his words and west with his action, that’s where all the jokes live. Now, what are the things he’s lying about? If the things he’s lying about have a moral component, then your jokes will have a moral component. In other words, you don’t choose the flavor. The flavor is chosen by politics itself.That’s sort of a general answer about the default moral nature of political satire. I was asking more specifically about whether or not you personally feel any sense of moral obligation about your work. No. I mean, I have a morality. I suppose it’s related to my Catholicity. I was raised in a devout Catholic home and bottle-fed Robert Bolt’s “A Man for All Seasons,”5 which is about how it’s important that you not let the tide of history sweep you along if you don’t actually agree with it. And William Buckley said he “stands athwart history, yelling stop.”6 I think we, with the show, stand athwart history and say: “That’s dumb. What a load of [expletive] that is.” Is that moral? I don’t know. I know that public lies that you are impelled to believe are worse than private ones. But I’m not Erin Brockovich.7 I’m sure as hell not Howard Beale.8 A fair amount of the time, I’m making poop jokes. Matter of fact, Jon Stewart, when it looked like “The Colbert Report” had come out of the box fully assembled and was going to happen, he said to me, “When your children go up to get their diplomas at whatever college they end up going to, I want you to whisper to yourself quietly as they get the sheepskin, ‘I paid for some of this with poop jokes.’”Steve Carell, Paul Dinello, Colbert and David Razowsky performing in “Take Me Out to the Balkans” at Second City in Chicago in 1993. From Second CityGoing back to “The Colbert Report” — Everything I did working up to Jon Stewart, I purposely didn’t do anything topical. “Strangers With Candy,”9 we didn’t live in the real world. In some ways, surreal comedy is enjoyable because it relieves you of any moral component. Really stupid, silly, absurd comedy is a wonderful retreat. I used to do this game when I was younger where I would hold up a piece of broccoli. I would look at the piece of broccoli until I could forget which way it was going to drop when I let it go. I would literally hold a piece of broccoli and say: “Forget which way is down. Forget your gravitocentric world, and just let go of that broccoli.” And I knew it had worked if I let it go and the broccoli dropped toward the table and I laughed, like, “I didn’t see that coming!” I used to do the same thing where I would go into a bathroom at work, and I would lock the door. Then I would try to forget whether or not I had locked the door. If someone came and jiggled the door handle and I was startled, I would know I had forgotten. That was a way to unknow the world, so I could see it differently and maybe write more absurd jokes.When you were doing “The Colbert Report,” there was a huge amount of projection happening on the part of the audience about who you really were and what you really thought.10 Since you’ve switched to “The Late Show” and stopped playing a character, what’s been the most interesting or weirdest idea you’ve noticed people projecting onto you? That I want to be a political force. That’s the weirdest thing. I said to Jon, back in the day: “You and I are like Frodo and Samwise. We’re trying to throw the damn ring in the volcano. It doesn’t occur to them that we don’t want to use it.” Our way of throwing the ring in the volcano is to make fun of political behavior. But people got mad at me. “Oh, now he’s fashioning himself as a player.” And I’m like, you could not be more wrong. If you think I want that, you know nothing about me. I just want to make jokes. I care about what happens in the news. I have an audience that seems to care, too. We mesh on the jokes. It’s not complicated.How many times have you read “The Lord of the Rings?” I lost count at 50. I am in the middle of a 180-hour lecture series by Corey Olsen, the Tolkien professor, who goes through it page by page. Almost every night I listen to about 15 minutes of a lecture.Colbert with Amy Sedaris and Paul Dinello on the set of “Strangers With Candy” series. Comedy Central/PhotofestWhat is it about those books for you? There are very few fictional works with that depth and background. Those first stories — Eärendil the Mariner — those attempts to create a national epic like the Finns have the Kalevala;11 England did not have that, so that’s Tolkien’s magnum opus, and he was still working on that in 1973 when he died. This attempt that he had to create a gesamtkunstwerk. It’s a complete work. A total work of art.But what do you get from “The Lord of the Rings” emotionally? Loss.What about loss? Tolkien makes loss beautiful. He has a medievalist view of the world: The world is in a constant state of diminishment. The elves originally create the rings to stop the diminishment of the world, to maintain the beauty of the moment of creation that they came into. And the great revelation, which comes from Tolkien’s elves, is that men are incredibly ambitious and build high towers because they know they’re going to be gone. The elves are laid-back because they’re going to be around forever, and so they don’t have great ambition. Their great continuing sadness is that they see the diminishment of the world. That sadness is, I think, a big part of Catholicism. Because God himself dies, and God himself has agony and, of course, original sin.Did the books help you make sense of your own loss? Sure, of course. Nobody gets out unscathed. Frodo, he’s the hero, but he has to go to Valinor to be healed of his wounds, and Gandalf says, I will not say: do not cry, for not all tears are an evil. And Galadriel, when she doesn’t take the ring — what’s beautiful about that is that she says: “I pass the test. I will diminish and go into the West and remain Galadriel.” The heroic thing to do is to accept your diminishment, to accept — in the human’s case — death. In Tolkien’s world, death is the gift of Ilúvatar, who’s the one God. Catholicism is deeply combed through all these things. To perceive the world in the light of eternity, to accept your death as a gift, to accept suffering as a path toward joy. All of those are in Christ on the cross. So I think the books are another way for me to perceive the reality that my faith is trying to reveal to me through its tradition.I want to ask you what’s probably a naïve question about faith. But I promise that it’s sincere, and it’s about something I’m hoping you can help me with. I know that faith is a subject that often gets raised in interviews with you. It does get raised a lot, because it first got raised, and then it self-perpetuates. I guess not a lot of people in my business are comfortable talking about it. But it means a lot to me, and it was a big part of my identity growing up.You’ve said something to the effect that “The Late Show” can help to remind people that there is rational, objective reality and that a politician can’t just say “this is what’s real” and expect to have people believe it. I don’t know whether I have ever said that.12 You’re phrasing that in an interesting way that has a different meaning than I intended, but finish your question, and I’ll see where you’re going with that.Thank you. So this is related to the idea of how belief in nationalism is ultimately about the feeling and comfort that idea gives people and maybe not so much about objective facts, which is to say it’s about a kind of faith. But, and I think this is part of what I’ve always stumbled over with religion, why is it that we might accept a form of belief that perhaps doesn’t jibe with objective reality as being fundamentally problematic and socially detrimental while another one — religious belief — we’re supposed to understand as O.K.? Can parallels be drawn there? That’s interesting. That’s a really big question. I think you’re describing two different things. Everyone approaches their own faith in their own way. So you might be describing an exact parallel between someone’s faith and our present political moment. There might be no difference to some people. To me, there’s a difference because in the red meat that gets thrown out in many political rallies, not just this president’s, you’re indulging the audience’s appetite. That’s not the same thing as appealing to their principles. To indulge the audience’s appetite is what my old character on “The Colbert Report” used to do. That was indulging a white, Christian, straight male American hegemonic self-image, and that’s not the same thing as faith. Faith is an acceptance of reality for me, and it is an attempt to humbly perceive what your role is, and my faith, as anemic as it is, reminds me of values of fellowship, love, humility. Those are all things that I might have in common with people at anyone’s red-meat-slinging rally, but when the meat is offered at those rallies, maybe the principles aren’t as important as the meat. Faith is different. Faith is not trying to change the world. Faith is not trying to change God. Faith isn’t trying to change the order of things. Faith isn’t trying to maintain your position. Faith isn’t trying to make less of the other. Faith is asking God to change you. You are the subject of God’s love, and in accepting that, you can transform yourself and release yourself of these appetites that are almost always at someone else’s expense. That’s how they’re different to me. But you asked because you were wondering whether I could give that to you? Because I can’t.No, no. I just thought you would help me by having a thoughtful answer to my confused question. Which you did. I’m O.K. talking about my faith, but I work very hard not to proselytize. I would never want anybody to think I was trying to convince them of my point of view. Because, hey, more Jesus for me.Colbert at the White House in 2007 before the taping of a press-conference skit for “The Colbert Report.” Brendan Smialowski/Getty ImagesThe other day your monologue was about the de facto Alabama abortion ban. Yeah, I had avoided making jokes about it, because you can’t win making jokes about abortion. Half of the people are just going to be mad at you. But Alabama was an unavoidable one. The reason we did it was because that was about, I thought, a very cynical, purposeful overreach. Even the people who were writing the law said they don’t want that law.Because it’s about getting the law kicked up to the Supreme Court? Right. But I don’t understand why the governor would sign that law. That seemed like a real misuse of legislation. Write the law you want, and then see whether the Supreme Court supports you. Don’t write the law you don’t want just so it will go to the Supreme Court. The whole thing seems so contemptible to me. But that had such a larger political perspective to it that it seemed as though not talking about it would have been an odd breaking of my own rule: We talk about what people are talking about.Your monologue did make me wonder where you stand on the legal right to an abortion. I doubt I’ll ever need to get one.Well, can I ask, then, if you support a woman’s legal right to an abortion? I support a woman’s legal right to exert all her rights. One of her rights, presently, is to have an abortion. I am not in favor of the judges who have been appointed who might likely overturn that. I respect the women I know and their opinion on the subject. I believe that abortion is a woman’s choice. I also know and love many people who feel differently.Thank you for addressing that. I know it’s a complicated subject. It’s not really a difficult subject for me in terms of its political reality. It’s a difficult subject for me because of its comedy. It is a march through a desert comedically, and I do not mistake myself for a political figure. I’m a comedian, and so my reticence has nothing to do with my politics.So to return to the idea that people incorrectly might think that you want to be a political player. Which is understandable, because a reality star is president.Do you consider the balance of whom you’re making jokes about? Sure. That’s going to be helped now because there are Democrats to talk about. When Joe Biden got heat for sniffing women’s heads, we did an act that he was doing A.S.M.R. We make jokes about Beto O’Rourke. We make jokes about Elizabeth Warren. We make jokes about Andrew Yang. We make jokes about Pete Buttigieg. What I’m happy about is that my audience is laughing at all of them, which is good. But not everybody is as mockable as everybody else, and some mockability doesn’t have consequences. Now, maybe Andrew Yang will be president — I don’t know [expletive] about politics; I only know about human behavior — but his running on no circumcision, free money and legalized pot13 is of no consequence compared with Donald Trump. So in terms of balance, I don’t really care. I care about being honest about what people talked about today.Senator Elizabeth Warren on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” in March. Scott Kowalchyk/CBS, via Getty ImagesIn what ways do you know about human behavior? I was trained as an actor, and there’s a philosophical introspective aspect of acting. Because of that training, I approach political satire not through politics but: Why is that person behaving that way? What are the insecurities inside the president? Why does he need to lie? That’s not about politics. I deconstruct human behavior and think,What’s funny about that?Can you apply that same actorly psychological analysis to yourself? What’s funny about your own behavior? If I’m enjoying a meeting I’m having with someone, I interrupt them constantly. If I’m bored by the meeting, I look like I’m very attentive. I am late for everything. I can relate anything you say back to something from the legendarium of J.R.R. Tolkien or his letters, to a fault. I can usually summon up a little bit of poetry that has something to do with what we’ve just talked about. All of these show that my mind is something of a squirrel cage. I scramble all over the place. Having a conversation with me is like having a conversation with three different people at the same time. Oh, I also cry easily.As far as the larger conversation we’re all having, do you think there’s a way in which, intentionally or not, your show functions as part of the political punditsphere we seem to be mired in, where it feels as if we’re all mad at one another all the time? You’re describing a divisive atmosphere, and when you say “function,” I think you mean, “Does it feed that?”Yes. It might. The behavior I’m exhibiting fits my genre, which is not supposed to have respectability. There’s a reason it’s not a central part of polite society. But there’s supposed to be a polite society out there! It’s not my fault there isn’t one anymore. I feel completely secure encouraging laughter at the behavior of people who I think are doing a terrible job and claiming that they’re doing it all for our benefit or being mendacious. So am I part of the problem? That is not for me to say. I just think I’m doing my job.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity from two conversations.
6010	 1978	a	SUICIDE, which was at CBGB's over the weekend, is a two‐man Sick band that has been around for several years but has just now—with most of the leading New York underground bands signed to major labels and distinct signs that people are looking for novelties beyond punk basics—begun to attract attention, particularly in Britain.Suicide offers an act consisting of three elements. By far the most interesting are the electronic‐keyboard machinations of Martin Rev, who sets up a grinding, overlapping texture of ostinatos. Some of those short, repeated figures recall primordial rock riffs. But the basic effect is both brutal (largely a matter of the deafening volume) and complex,If that were all there was to it, you would have something comfortably in the tradition of Klaus Schulze and the other German keyboard wizards, with a strong overlay of the Riley‐ReichGlass sort of motoric energy. But aside from the implied hostility of the vole, Suicide offers the contributions of Alan Vega, the singer.Mr. Vega's work blends lurid melodrama with the miming of crazed hostility. The vocal sounds come close to screams, and are refracted into a kind of aural chamber of mirrors by a heavy admixture of echo and other distorting devices. The song subjects are full of murderous imagery and urban angst.

4230	 1995	a	A FIRE that the New York Fire Department is calling suspicious broke out Monday night in the basement of the building that houses Nobu, at Hudson and Franklin Streets. Smoke began seeping up through the sushi bar, and the restaurant was evacuated.Marilyn Mode, the Deputy Fire Commissioner for public information, said the fire appeared to be suspicious because it had multiple origins. There were no injuries, she said, and fire marshals were investigating.Richard Notar, Nobu's general manager, said that the fire started at about 10:30 P.M. in the basement of the building's residential section and that about 80 people were evacuated. He said he had called about 200 people with reservations to say Nobu was closed. The earliest it could reopen is tonight, he said, pending a Health Department inspection, reconnection of gas lines and replacement of a gas meter, which melted.Drew Nieporent, an owner, said he expected the closing to be temporary. "There was a lot of smoke, but fortunately there was no other damage," Mr. Nieporent said.

2946	 2002	a	For the second time in a year, President Bush has moved to limit offshore drilling for oil and natural gas along Florida's Gulf Coast. He also proposed to buy the privately held oil, gas and other mineral rights under three nature preserves adjacent to Everglades National Park. If approved by Congress, his proposals will protect the beaches that provide much of Florida's tourist income, and will greatly assist the fragile South Florida ecosystem, which has suffered from development and years of official neglect. It is hardly coincidental that they will also help his brother Jeb's re-election prospects in the Florida governor's race this fall.The Everglades proposal will cost $120 million, which Congress must supply. The president will seek $115 million more to purchase seven oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico south of Pensacola. This proposal is a worthy sequel to Mr. Bush's decision last summer to reduce the area available to leasing in the eastern gulf to about one-quarter the acreage approved by the Clinton administration in 1997.Members of Congress who worry about the costs should be aware of powerful precedents. Facing similar opposition to drilling near the Florida Keys, the Clinton administration bought back 73 leases for $200 million. President Bill Clinton also won special appropriations for several important acquisitions, including $65 million to acquire a gold mining operation that threatened Yellowstone National Park and $250 million to acquire the Headwaters redwood forest in California from a private timber company.California politicians promptly demanded that Mr. Bush buy up 36 equally controversial leases off the Santa Barbara coastline, while environmentalists noted the inconsistency between the president's laudable efforts to protect his brother's state and his aggressive if unsuccessful attempt to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

2627	 2004	a	DAMIEN RICE -- People who first heard Damien Rice's songs of romantic yearning and disaster in concert were likely to find his 2003 album, ''O,'' fairly pallid, since it only presented his quiet -- not to say wimpy -- side. His language gets cruder and his arrangements more turbulent on the EP ''B-Sides'' (Vector), particularly in the blunt ''Woman Like a Man'' and the vertiginous ''Moody Mooday.'' But he still owes his fans a recording of what happens onstage, when his dynamics and distortion pedal transform songs into volatile epics of introspection.EEK-A-MOUSE -- While the producers of dancehall and ragga radicalize the world's rhythm tracks, more old-fashioned reggae still has a few tricks left, especially with Eek-A-Mouse at the microphone. His mixture of singing, chanting, grunting and nasal, off-the-wall scat-singing sends his vocals ricocheting around the best tracks on ''Eek-A-Speeka'' (Greensleeves). Romance stumbles into a sonic house of mirrors in ''I'll Be Waiting'' and ''Pretty So,'' while echoes, comedy and paranoia mingle in ''Every Posse (Fly Down)'' and ''Mean Dreams.''BADLY DRAWN BOY -- It's becoming clearer with every album and every overlong concert set that Damon Gough, or Badly Drawn Boy, can't tell a good song from a bad one or a cliché from an insight. His new album, ''One Plus One Is One'' (Astralwerks/EMI), is typically hit or miss, but when he's not trying to be John Lennon, he comes up with modest but telling songs about love and mortality like ''Easy Love'' and ''Fewer Words'' and goofy mini-suites like ''Take the Glory'' and ''Holy Grail.''MIS-TEEQ -- From this side of the Atlantic, the English dance music called garage has always seemed to be playing catch-up with the terse computerized productions and glossy vocals of mainstream American R & B. But the gap is shrinking. Mis-Teeq's American debut album, ''Mis-Teeq'' (Reprise), culls songs from two British albums to come across like Destiny's Child without the jittery doubletime rhythms and TLC without the personality contrasts. While superficiality reigns, Mis-Teeq is slick and ingenious, especially in its brisk kiss-off songs.SISTER GERTRUDE MORGAN -- Dressed in a nurse's uniform, Sister Gertrude Morgan used to wander through the French Quarter of New Orleans, shaking a tambourine and singing gospel songs that she sometimes made up on the spot; she also painted in a self-taught style that has made her a folk-art heroine since her death in 1980. ''Let's Make a Record'' (Preservation Hall) was recorded in 1970, with just Morgan, her raw voice and her tambourine in the studio. Her songs hold bits of old gospel tunes, but mostly they are chants that bear down on a few words -- ''Power, Lord, power!'' -- and accelerate until they become unstoppable incantations; sometimes she lets herself get carried into preaching. The connections to Africa, and to New Orleans' Mardi Gras Indian chants, are strong, and her fervor is stronger.

2738	 2003	a	A lawyer for the city said that although the city had agreed to send out the directives, the city maintains that no new policy of selective-enforcement has ever been instituted, and that the increase in arrests merely reflects a sharp increase in the number of contacts between officers and homeless people.''There were more arrests because there was more activity,'' the lawyer, Gail Donoghue, special assistant to the corporation counsel, said. She described the directives as ''a confirmation of our existing policy and practice.''''The policy was and is, as part of Police Department training and procedures, that people are treated the same,'' Ms. Donoghue said. ''But we didn't have these things written out.''''It is our policy,'' she added. ''We have no reason not to write it down.''A police spokesman had no additional comment.The lawsuit charged that after reports in the news media last fall about a significant increase in the number of homeless people on the streets, top police officials directed the Homeless Outreach Unit to change its mission, from one of offering services to arrest. The suit said that officers had also been told that they were not to enforce the law in a similar manner against people who were not homeless.The new directives have been read aloud at 10 consecutive roll calls of the Homeless Outreach Unit and the Transit Bureau, and distributed to individual officers, the documents show.They also offer guidance to members of the Homeless Outreach Unit when carrying out their duties. For example, if an officer finds a person stretched out on a subway seat or a park bench, the officer must first ''take appropriate corrective action.''

4770	 1991	a	Credit-card issuers are resorting to such incentives because they have cards in the hands of nearly everyone who qualifies for one. Up to 90 percent of the eligible households have an American Express, Visa, Mastercard or Discover card, analysts say. More than 111 million people have one or more credit cards.So now the card issuers want to get consumers to use their cards more frequently and charge larger amounts when they do. Card companies have been exploring many new outlets for card use, like movie theaters, fast-food restaurants and supermarkets.Last year, American consumers charged nearly $350 billion of goods and services on cards.The last big innovation in the credit-card business was instituted in 1987 by American Express and quickly copied by Visa and Mastercard. Their programs provided expanded warranties for items bought with a credit card in the case of breakage, loss, theft or fire damage. Not an Entirely New IdeaThe idea for Citibank's price-protection plan is not entirely new. Analysts say an Arizona bank, the Valley National Bank of Phoenix, pioneered the idea with its credit cards. Also, Diner's Club, another Citicorp unit, has a similar service, except that it charges an additional $49 fee and the service applies only to specific stores.Citibank would not disclose how much it expected to spend on the price-protection program. Industry analysts say the cost could be relatively little, if credit-card issuers' experience with warranties is any guide -- very few cardholders have filed claims under the warranty program.H. Spencer Nilson, publisher of The Nilson Report, an industry newsletter, estimates that substantially fewer than 1 percent of card holders file claims under programs like buyer protection. In addition, people who buy larger-ticket items like furniture and stereo equipment are likely to comparison-shop anyway and get the lowest price. Whatever the minimal cost of the program, it is likely to be offset by more purchases on credit cards."It is a very crowded market," Mr. Nilson said. "The first one in the market with an incentive like this gets the advantage. Everyone else is a me-too." Important Merchant Fees

4817	 1991	a	To the Editor:American journalism is so steeped in folklore and mythology that it is often nearly impossible to separate fact from fiction. Sylvia Orans (letter, July 9) repeats the persistent fable about William Randolph Hearst's purported cable to the artist Frederic Remington, whom he had sent to Cuba to provide illustrations of the United States war with Spain -- "You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war."It makes a good story and catches the flavor of the "yellow journalism" practiced by Hearst. But there is no evidence, nor has there ever been any, that Hearst sent such a cable.In "Sensationalism and the New York Press" (New York, 1991), John D. Stevens, professor of communication at the University of Michigan, noted that the apocryphal tale originated with James Creelman, a "bellicose" reporter for Joseph Pulitzer's New York World who was kicked out of Cuba in 1896 by the Spaniards because of his wildly irresponsible dispatches. Hearst apparently perceived this as a recommendation and lured him away from Pulitzer to write for Hearst's New York Journal.Stevens observed: "Creelman's memoir is the only evidence for the infamous anecdote about Hearst's cabling Remington that he would provide the war. Although Creelman was in Florida at that time and gave no indication of where or how he learned this story, historians still repeat it. Neither Remington nor Davis" -- Richard Harding Davis, the correspondent, who then worked for Hearst -- "mentioned it, either in frequent letters home nor in later memoirs, and Hearst flatly denied the story." DOM BONAFEDE Associate Prof., Communication American University Washington, July 9, 1991
4842	 1991	a	"The armed forces of Haiti insist on reaffirming that it is an apolitical institution at the service of the Haitian people," General Cedras said in his statement, carried on Radio France Internationale. "It will respect constitutional order, guarantee democratic liberty and will not condone any act of pillage and even less so the flaming tire necklace execution."General Cedras urged the population to help create a "serene climate favorable to the next election."A powerful sector of Haiti's 7,000-member army has long opposed the leftist policies of Mr. Aristide, a Roman Catholic priest who draws much of his popularity from the impoverished masses. The leaders of the military takeover today charged that Mr. Aristide was interfering in army affairs.At least 26 people were killed and 200 wounded as Aristide loyalists battled soldiers. The sounds of gunfire continued late into the night. International ReactionThe United States and Canada condemned the coup attempt and demanded Mr. Aristide's release. The Organization of American States demanded that Mr. Aristide be returned to office and said those who arrested him would be held accountable. It called a meeting of leaders within the next 10 days to consider options that could include the use of force.The United Nations Security Council convened in a late-night session.The uprising occurred four days after Mr. Aristide addressed the United Nations General Assembly his first trip to the United States since becoming president of this coup-prone Caribbean nation. He said at the time that he was certain Haiti had left the dark days of dictatorship behind.Mr. Aristide's visit to New York, a city where there are 300,000 people of Haitian descent, the largest population outside the Caribbean nation itself, touched off carnival-like celebrations. In his address to the United Nations, he stressed peace and human rights themes.

1183	 2012	a	Yuri Gripas/ReutersSummertime presents a challenge for a presidential candidate: how to take advantage of the long, hot weeks before the party conventions kick the campaign into high gear?This Fourth of July holiday week provides an initial peek into the strategies of President Obama and Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee.Mr. Obama will take the first half of the week off and then travel through Ohio and Pennsylvania on a two-day bus tour. Mr. Romney is taking the full week off, except for a brief appearance at a Fourth of July parade near his vacation home in New Hampshire.But not taking a break are the television advertisements from both campaigns, which are continuing to accelerate.Here are the particulars of the candidates’ week ahead:OBAMA The president and his family will start the week at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland before returning to the White House for the holiday on Wednesday. Mr. Obama will host members of the military for a Fourth of July picnic on the White House lawn — one of the perks of incumbency.But the relaxation ends on Thursday, when Mr. Obama begins the bus tour through Ohio, with a stop in western Pennsylvania.The presidential trip follows Mr. Romney’s recent five-day bus tour, and it highlights Mr. Obama’s focus on battleground states like Ohio. It is also intended to get the president out of the formal confines of the West Wing to make a closer connection with the voting public.Mr. Obama has long complained about feeling stifled and disconnected from the public in Washington. The campaign, and especially the bus tour, helps avoid the kind of “Rose Garden isolation” that his campaign fears will feed an impression that he does not understand the economic plight of struggling Americans. Aides said the tour would focus on the economy.One thing to watch for: on Friday, while Mr. Obama is on the road, the government will issue the jobs and unemployment reports for June. The timing will give the president a real-world backdrop when he reacts to the numbers — a better image than the blue curtains of the White House briefing room, where he said last month that the “private sector is doing fine.”ROMNEY Every summer, Mr. Romney’s extended family gathers at his vacation home on a lake in Wolfeboro, N.H., for a week of competitive sports and private time. (They call it the “Romney Olympics,” according to The Washington Post.)A presidential campaign apparently does not get in the way.Taking this week off is probably good timing. Voters are likely to be paying more attention to their barbecue grills than their television sets as they celebrate the holiday.But the weeklong break also fits in with Mr. Romney’s overall campaign strategy of trying to keep the focus on the president’s record — not his own. Aides say they believe that voters in November will harshly judge Mr. Obama’s handling of the economy over the last three and a half years. Staying off the campaign trail, except for the brief appearance at the parade in Wolfeboro, will ensure that Mr. Romney will not say or do anything that might get in the way of that message.One curious question is how Mr. Romney plans to respond to the jobs report on Friday. It would seem an odd choice for him to comment on the news with his six-bedroom home on 13 acres as a backdrop. Mr. Romney could change his plans and travel to a small business or another location. The campaign has not said what its plans are for Friday.

4421	 1993	a	In the end, the burdens were more than the Buffalo Bills could bear.There was the weight of failure in the previous two Super Bowls and the weight of expectations for Super Bowl XXVII yesterday. And if that wasn't enough, the Dallas Cowboys quickly brought their own pressure to bear, forcing nine Buffalo turnovers as they humiliated the Bills, 52-17.The Bills, whose turnovers set a Super Bowl record, were left to make history as the first team to lose three consecutive Super Bowls.Jim Kelly, the Buffalo quarterback, had two passes intercepted before he was forced out of the game in the second quarter. That brought on Frank Reich, architect of the greatest comeback in college football history and, recently, pro football's greatest -- a playoff victory over Houston in which the Bills rallied from 32 points down.But yesterday in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., it was not to be. Troy Aikman's four touchdown passes revived the glory of the Dallas Cowboys, a team that had not been to the Super Bowl in 14 years. Presiding over it all was Jimmy Johnson, who in his fourth year as the Cowboys' coach became the only man to lead a college team, the University of Miami, to a national championship and a pro football team to a Super Bowl victory.

4792	 1991	a	The change in accounting rules, plus losses totaling $372 million in 1988 and 1989, left Goldome at the end of 1990 with a negative capital position of $452.4 million. Although the company was insolvent under accounting rules, banking regulators allowed it to stay in business while new management returned it to profitability and searched for fresh capital. Changing ApproachAfter Thomas A. Cooper, a former president of the BankAmerica Corporation, became chairman two years ago, Goldome cut non-interest expenses to $255 million in 1990 from $438 million in 1989, and began to concentrate on collecting deposits and making loans to middle-income consumers in the Buffalo area, where 35 percent of the households have an account with the bank.As part of its effort to make a turnaround, Goldome sold 24 branches with $2.8 billion of deposits in the New York City area to the Manufactures Hanover Trust Company during late 1989 and earlier this year.Because of the strong position of Goldome in the Buffalo area, and its return to profitability -- the company earned $37.5 million in 1990 -- Mr. Cooper said earlier this year that the company was "worth much more than is shown on its balance sheet." Search for InvestorsBut Mr. Cooper's efforts to assemble a group of investors were unsuccessful, and other potential buyers, including GE Capital, decided against investing in the company. Investment bankers said many other banks were interested in Goldome, but none could compete with Keycorp and First Empire, which had the advantage of local branch networks that could be economically merged with Goldome's system.Keycorp and First Empire, which agreed to add $195 million and $40 million of capital, respectively, to their banking units, face limited risk of loss because the F.D.I.C. agreed to take about $1.8 billion of loans and other assets from Goldome subsidiaries, as well as $400 million of weak loans from Goldome's Buffalo savings bank.In addition, the two companies may return for three years any Goldome loans that turn bad. To attract the two buyers, the F.D.I.C. agreed to pay $163 million to Keycorp and $40 million to First Empire, a Keycorp official said.Keycorp and First Empire previously collaborated in 1989 in the purchase of branches and deposits of the Empire of America Corporation, another Buffalo savings bank that ran into trouble during the 1980's, when it expanded outside its local market.

161	 2018	a	Most presidents will at some point benefit from a surging economy and stock market, but none has claimed more credit for them than Donald J. Trump, as he did again during this week’s State of the Union address. Among the highlights:• “$8 trillion and more” in stock market gains.• “2.4 million new jobs” created since his election.• “Over 3 million workers have gotten tax-cut bonuses” and “rising wages.”• All thanks to “the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.”Since the president has frequently complained that the media denies him credit for any of this, I thought it only fair to assess the degree to which the undeniably strong economy, low unemployment and surging stock market are because of Mr. Trump’s achievements, notably his sweeping tax bill.It turns out that’s no easy task, especially since Mr. Trump has only been president for a year, and the tax legislation is little more than a month old. Economists are still debating the impact on the economy of Ronald Reagan’s 1986 tax reform legislation more than 30 years after its passage.“It’s not like chemistry or physics where you can do a controlled experiment and change one variable,” said Joel Slemrod, professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, and co-author of a seminal study of the economic impact of the 1986 tax reform act. “We can never be entirely sure because we don’t know what would have happened without the tax act.”

3688	 1998	a	Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students investigate the role of mathematics in their everyday lives. They then discover, through reading a Times article and through analyzing a specific example of art, that mathematics exists on a deeper ‘metaphoric’ level in art.Author(s):Alison Zimbalist, The New York Times Learning NetworkSuggested Time Allowance: 45 minutesObjectives:Students will:1. List and discuss all that they do on a daily basis that involves mathematics, both on obvious and more hidden levels.2. Read and discuss “Mathematical Metaphors Abound in Art and Fiction.”3. Relate a mathematical concept metaphorically to a piece of art.Resources / Materials:paperpens/ pencilscopies of “Mathematical Metaphors Abound in Art and Fiction ” (one per student)Activities / Procedures:1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: Students list all the things that they do that involve mathematics. Students then share their lists with the class as the teacher writes suggestions on the board. Students then add to the class list by brainstorming other daily tasks or chores that involve mathematics.2. Read the article “Mathematical Metaphors Abound in Art and Fiction ” and discuss the following questions:–The author of this piece argues that “Good Will Hunting” is not a movie about math just because much of the plot revolves around a mathematical genius. How does he support this argument? What stereotypes about mathematicians does he feel are promoted by the movie?–In what way does the movie “Sliding Doors” relate to mathematical concepts?–How does Chuck Close’s art retrospective incorporate mathematics?–How does the novel “Larry’s Party” relate to mathematical concepts?–What does the writer mean when he says that “mathematics, like beauty, is more than skin-deep”?3. WRAP-UP/ HOMEWORK: Students search for mathemetical metaphors in favorite books, stories, art pieces, music, movies, or television shows. Students choose one of these examples and describe in writing the mathematical concept or theory it expresses. Teachers may need to help younger students with creating such metaphoric comparisons.Further Questions for Discussion:What are some examples of stereotypes about mathematicians and people who are interested in and good at doing math? How do movies and television promote these stereotypes?How does math apply to the profession that you want to pursue?What are some examples of mathematics employed in music?What are some examples of mathematics employed in dance?What is the relevance of mathematics in your daily life?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on participation in classroom discussion and “mathematical metaphors in art” project.Vocabulary:dimunition, derives, peripheral, discipline, chaos theory, trajectories, intersect, compression, labyrinths, symmetry, geometry, continuum, abstract algebra, profound, intuitiveExtension Activities:1. Students interview a person who uses math in his or her occupation. Students should find out specifically how math is used in this occupation and obtain an example of a typical math problem (worked out to find a solution). This information can then be posted in the classroom.2. Study a famous mathematician or mathematical discovery, and present this information to the class.3. Find another New York Times article dealing with mathematics in the “everyday” world to read and discuss with your classmates.Interdisciplinary Connections:Science: Relate perceptions and stereotypes of scientists to those of mathematicians. How are scientists portrayed in movies and on television? How are these media stereotypes similar? How are they different?Language Arts: Study the “mathematics of poetry” (specifically, meter and rhyme schemes).Academic Content Standards:Grades 6-8Mathematics Standard 9- Understands the general nature and uses of mathematics. Benchmark: Understands that mathematicians often represent real things using abstract ideas like numbers or lines- they then work with these abstractions to learn about the things they represent.Art Connections Standard 1- Understands connections among the various art forms and other disciplines. Benchmark: Knows how various concepts and principles are used in the arts and disciplines outside the arts (e.g., balance, shape, pattern)Grades 9-12Mathematics Standard 9- Understands the general nature and uses of mathematics. Benchmarks: Understands that theories in mathematics are greatly influenced by practical issues- real-world problems sometimes result in new mathematical theories and pure mathematical theories sometimes have highly practical applications; Understands that mathematics provides a precise system to describe objects, events, and relationships and to construct logical arguments; Understands that mathematics often stimulates innovations in science and technologyArt Connections Standard 1- Understands connections among the various art forms and other disciplines. Benchmarks: Knows ways in which various art media can be integrated; Understands how elements, materials, technologies, artistic processes, and organizational principles are used in similar and distinctive ways in the various art formsThis lesson plan may be used to address the academic standards listed above.

55	 2019	a	MONTREAL — Maha Kassef, 35, an ambitious elementary schoolteacher, aspires to become a principal. But since she wears a Muslim head scarf, she may have to derail her dreams: A proposed bill in Quebec would bar public school principals, and other public employees, from wearing religious symbols.“How am I supposed to teach about respect, tolerance and diversity to my students, many of whom are immigrant kids, when the government is asking me to give up who I am?” asked Ms. Kassef, the child of Kuwaiti immigrant parents who worked tirelessly to send her and her four siblings to college.“What right does the Quebec government have to stop my career?” she added.Religious minorities in Quebec are reeling after the right-leaning government of François Legault proposed the law last week. It would prohibit not just teachers, but other public sector workers in positions of authority, including lawyers and police officers, from wearing religious symbols while working.Current public sector workers would get an exemption, though only as long as they stay in the same position within the same organization, according to the bill. This means that a teacher, for example, could not change schools or be promoted if she refused to take off her head scarf.
1791	 2009	a	As wartime speeches go, it was a strange and schizophrenic one, laying its emphasis on two not-necessarily-compatible goals — victory, and a swift withdrawal. In one breath Obama was echoing his previous description of Afghanistan as a “war of necessity,” referencing our “vital national interests” and describing the conflict’s stakes as both “the security of our Allies, and the common security of the world.” The next he was offering the Taliban a date to circle on their calendars, and hold out for throughout the American offensive to come — July of 2011, that is, when the Obama administration is now committed to beginning the withdrawal of our forces from Afghanistan. This commitment, of course, was hedged with a substantial caveat: “We will execute this transition responsibly, taking into account conditions on the ground.” But still, the date is there: After more than eight years of fighting the United States, our enemies know that we’ve set ourselves a deadline to win or get out that’s only a short eighteen months away.Judged solely as policy, simultaneously escalating and setting ourselves a near-term deadline might be the right approach to a war that may not be winnable, but that deserves a more significant commitment before we give it up as lost. But the White House could have set itself a private deadline without telling the world exactly what it is. And I’m skeptical that making the deadline so public, and so specific, won’t tend to undercut our military efforts. In the portion of the speech that aimed to pre-empt criticism from right and left alike, Obama argued that “the absence of a timeframe for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government.” But surely there are plenty of reasons for this administration to feel (and instill) a sense of urgency — from the weight of public opinion, to the restiveness of the Democratic base, to the strain on our military and our alliances — without adding the burden of a public deadline as well!Broadly speaking, it struck me as one of Obama’s least effective speeches. I can’t imagine any anti-war liberal being convinced to favor escalation by his arguments. I can’t imagine any pro-escalation conservative feeling confident that Obama is really committed to the effort he’s embarking on. And above all, I can’t imagine any up-in-the-air, uncertain American being reassured that we have a military strategy capable of delivering a successful outcome — because Obama barely seemed to talk about military strategy at all.Indeed, in this regard I think it’s worth comparing tonight’s speech, unfavorably, to George W. Bush’s address announcing the Iraqi surge. Whereas that speech was tightly focused on the shift in military and diplomatic strategy, Obama’s remarks tried to cover the history of the American involvement in Afghanistan, the state of our domestic politics, and even the nature of America’s mission in the world, while pre-butting various possible attacks on his decision-making. Obama was more comprehensive; Bush was much better. And now we have to hope that the President’s strategy is more successful than his speech.

4828	 1991	a	As they move from the traditions of totalitarianism to open government, politicians in Russia and the other republics might take note of two essential elements of late 20th-century American bureaucracy: the doctrine of plausible deniability and its indispensable accessory, the shredder. Both were conspicuously absent in the failed Soviet coup.Soviet officials who might have come to Mr. Gorbachev's aid but didn't fell back on the ridiculous "coup flu" excuse. They produced no backdated memos, claimed no memory loss and found not a single subordinate to blame.The Kremlin plotters, meanwhile, devoted even less thought to covering their tracks. Instead, they held a press conference to declare their treason and left a paper trail of signed decrees so blatantly criminal that any self-respecting Washington secretary would deep-six them without a second thought.And that raises the second point. Apparently, the K.G.B. relies not on document shredders but ancient, subterranean furnaces. This system has major flaws. It leads to releases of smoke that contribute unacceptably to urban smog, and it tends to alert the public that an obstruction of justice is under way.
3697	 1998	a	An armed robbery at a Brooklyn gas station was foiled yesterday by an off-duty police sergeant who witnessed the robbery, chased down the suspect and shot him once in the leg during a furious struggle before arresting him, the police said.Sgt. Raymond Martinez, a 10-year veteran who was promoted to sergeant on Friday, was driving to his post at the department's Housing Bureau at 6:30 A.M. yesterday when he saw a robbery in progress at a Citygas Station on Atlantic Avenue near Hale Street in the Highland Park section, the police said.During the robbery, the gas station attendant, Xavinder Singh, 26, was shot once in the foot before the gunman fled on a bicycle, said Sgt. Gerry Falcon, a department spokeswoman. Sergeant Martinez chased the suspect in his car and caught him a few blocks away, the police said.In a struggle, Sergeant Martinez shot the suspect once in the left shin, the police said. The suspect, David Golden, 35, of Brooklyn, was arrested, and a .380-caliber handgun was seized from him at the scene, Sergeant Falcon said.

7478	 1964	a	The Philadelphia and Reading Corporation, manufacturer of toys and apparel, reported yesterday a second‐quarter net income of $2,418,000, equal to 81 cents a share. In the corresponding 1963 quarter, the company cleared $1,104,000, or 36 cents a share, after a nonrecurring charge of $897,000. Net sales totaled $51,598,000 and $39,755,000, respectively.In the first six months, the company earned $4,006,000, equal to $1.36 a share, on sales of $93,382,000. A. year earlier, profits came to $9,130,000, or $2.99 a sharer after a special gain of $5,996,000. Sales in the 1963 period totaled $72,728,000.
3832	 1997	a	How do you spell war? At The New York Post, a picture is worth a thousand polysyllabic synonyms.On Friday, newspapers across the nation published photographs of Rebecca A. Sealfon of Brooklyn Heights, the National Spelling Bee winner, leaping triumphantly, a yellow placard identifying The Daily News as her sponsor hanging broadly across her chest.Like many papers, The Post printed an Associated Press photograph of Rebecca. But ever the gladiator in the tabloid arena, it erased the name of its competitor.The A.P. does not manipulate photographs and prefers others to follow a similar policy, said Vincent J. Alabiso, its executive photo editor.Arthur Browne, managing editor of The Daily News, had some fighting words. ''It strikes me as the act of a newspaper suffering from a deep inferiority complex,'' he said. Editors of The Post did not return calls. DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

2476	 2005	a	Gary Mount, a 10th-generation farmer in central New Jersey who owns Terhune Orchards, has an irrigation system and estimated he used 50 percent more water than average this year, growing 35 crops on 200 acres in Princeton. His farm stand on Cold Soil Road features pick-your-own raspberries, apple cider slush, a separate section for children to ride toy tractors, and a staff wearing red T-shirts proclaiming "Apple Corps."He was glad to have an irrigation system powered by electricity instead of costly diesel. In 2002, the state's Department of Agriculture found that 2,124 farms out of 9,924 were irrigated. With irrigation, many New Jersey farmers are able to withstand droughts, if power and water remain affordable. "Every single one of them would tell you they'd rather add water than subtract it," Mr. Mount said, noting that wet seasons brought pests and diseases.New Jersey farmers, especially those who sell their produce wholesale rather than at produce stands or farmers' markets, have a tough time, Mr. Mount said. "Everything we put in is more expensive -- land, labor, supplies," he said, adding that New Jersey had one of the highest farmland tax rates in the country. "It makes for a higher cost, but prices are determined on a national level."Ed Gaventa, 44, farms about 200 acres in Logan Township in Gloucester County. His farm lost most of its 20-acre pumpkin harvest because of the heat. He would usually harvest 200 bins, selling at $100 each on the wholesale market, but is ending up with seven bins, which he will try to sell at retail, expecting to make $1,000 at best, or $19,000 less than he had anticipated. "In our business, we can't set a price," he said. "We're at the mercy of what the market is going to give us."Most of Connecticut received an inch and an half less rain than average this growing season, said Erica Fearn, executive director of the state's Farm Bureau. In the New London area, which has been extremely dry, some silage corn has been harvested early because of the weather.The growing season in New York was also very dry, said Peter Gregg, a spokesman for the New York Farm Bureau, a volunteer group. "Yields were down in a lot of cases because of the lack of rainfall," he said, "but the quality of fruits was extremely good because of all the sunshine." Expect very sweet apples this year, he said.The weather created other problems, including heat damage from watering hot crops, premature aging of plants and poor melon and squash pollination by bees spending more energy keeping their hives cooled.
3013	 2002	a	After an emotional five-week trial that reminded Parisians of this city's vulnerability to terrorism, a special French court has sentenced two members of Algeria's Armed Islamic Group to life imprisonment for their role in three bombings that killed eight people and wounded more than 200 others here in 1995.The bombings, among eight such attacks around France in the summer and fall of 1995, were claimed by the Armed Islamic Group as reprisals for French support for Algeria's army-backed government. Six bombings occurred in Paris, the worst on July 25, when eight people were killed and 150 wounded in an explosion of a gas canister packed with nails and bolts on a Paris regional train at St.-Michel station.On Tuesday evening, a seven-judge antiterrorist court convicted Boualem Bensaïd, 34, for placing a bomb in a trash bin near the Maison-Blanche Métro station on Oct. 16 and for complicity in both the St.-Michel bombing and another regional train bombing near the Musée d'Orsay Métro station on Oct. 17. Smaïn Ali Belkacem, 34, was convicted for planting the Musée d'Orsay train bomb. Both men had pleaded not guilty to the charges.The trial, which was attended by scores of people who had been wounded in the attacks as well as by family members carrying photographs of the eight people killed in the St.-Michel bombing, served to revive memories of the fear that gripped Paris in the second half of 1995 until the police finally detained many of the alleged terrorists. One suspect, Khalid Kelkal, identified as a ringleader, was gunned down by the police near Lyon.

2423	 2005	a	Correction AppendedWhether or not it contributes to global warming, carbon dioxide is turning the oceans acidic, Britain's leading scientific organization warned yesterday.In a report by a panel of scientists, the organization, the Royal Society, said the growing acidity would be very likely to harm coral reefs and other marine life by the end of the century."I think there are very serious issues to be addressed," the panel's chairman, Dr. John Raven of the University of Dundee in Scotland, said in an interview. "It will affect all organisms that have skeletons, shells, hard bits that are made of calcium carbonate."The 60-page report was timed to influence next week's Group of 8 economic summit meeting. Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, president of the group this year, has been calling for strong action to limit climate change.
3964	 1996	a	Military budgets may not be rising sharply anymore, but that has not eliminated Pentagon waste, a new study says.The Council for a Livable World, an arms control advocacy group that has sought reductions in military spending, and Taxpayers for Common Sense, cite examples of $29 billion in wasteful programs in a report to be released on Monday.The report details such projects as construction of a third golf course at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, a money-losing dairy herd at the Naval Academy, a Pentagon-leased hotel in Orlando, Fla., that loses $27 million a year, and a door hinge for the C-17 airplane that costs $2,187."Unfortunately, these examples are only the tip of the iceberg," the report said.A Pentagon spokeswoman, Susan Hanson, said that while she had not examined the report, such examples were closely investigated by Pentagon officials and often were corrected quickly. In other cases, she said, the "waste" alleged in the report may represent justifiable spending.

5945	 1982	a	Women's sports keep growing in partipication and prestige. Two measures of that progress will be evident here Monday night at the third Women's Sports Foundation annual awards dinner.First, 77 world-class female athletes will be guests, and second, many male sports celebrities will be there to honor them.Herb Brooks, the Rangers' coach, is one of the men who will present awards. ''I'm going to be there because I think women in athletics is a very healthy thing for our society,'' said Brooks, whose hockey season opens two days later. ''The spinoff is that our whole society will become more conscious of physical fitness, and go from a society of spectators to a society of participants.''Rafer Johnson, the 1960 Olympic decathalon champion, will present the Professional Sportswoman of the Year award. Steve Scott, the American mile record-holder, will present the award for the Amateur Sportswoman of the Year.

4463	 1993	a	The 15th Duke of Bournemouth has never had an easy time of it. When he was a baby in the 1960's, his father, the hippie 14th duke, and his American mother mislaid him in a restaurant. As an adult named Tommy (Eric Idle), the adopted son of a Pakistani family living in London, he continues to get the short end of the stick. He's a passive fellow until the day he finds out that he's the rightful heir to the Bournemouth title.It's then that Tommy takes action. He schemes to kill off the bogus 15th duke, a nervy American nitwit named Henry (Rick Moranis), who also happens to be his best friend. Though it's never really clear how Henry fell into his good fortune, don't look cockeyed gift horses in the mouth.It makes no difference that "Splitting Heirs," a brisk new English farce, has a plot more hysterically convoluted than that of "The Big Sleep." The film is a genial entertainment in the Monty Python tradition, a series of madly illogical sequences that even include something a screen card identifies as "Hindu Dream Sequence."As written by Mr. Idle and directed by Robert Young (an English film maker not to be confused with the American director of the same name), "Splitting Heirs" rambles with spirit and speed. The jokes and comedy routines are often intentionally awful ("I'm bisexual; whenever I want sex, I buy it"), and sometimes hilarious even though not entirely new.

4569	 1992	a	NEW YORK CITY EX-DINKINS AIDE IS INDICTEDArnold Biegen, Mayor Dinkins's former campaign finance chairman and longtime political adviser, was charged with stealing $158,000 from the Mayor's re-election fund by writing 29 checks to himself. The charges do not resolve the mystery of why Mr. Biegen, by all accounts a highly paid lawyer, might have attempted a theft, particularly one so blatant. Pages 1 and 24. BATTLE IS JOINED OVER HOMELESS PLANA special commission presented Mayor Dinkins with proposals to remake the city's homeless shelter system yesterday and immediately ran into criticism from officials in his administration. The officials questioned the practicality and cost of several major proposals, leaving the Mayor in the awkward position of deciding whether to take the advice of his staff or the commission he appointed.

1575	 2010	a	Ruth Fremson/The New York TimesSATURDAY’S PUZZLE — We get only one themeless crossword this week, and it’s a fun one by Barry C. Silk. I found it easier than average for this constructor but with plenty of terrific answers.My favorite clue is “Organization nickname that plays off the group’s secrecy.” Just look into this flashy thingy while I explain that the N.S.A. you thought you had heard of doesn’t even exit. The initials stand for NO SUCH AGENCY. Now go about your business. Experienced solvers know that when “organization” or “agency” is used in a clue, the answer usually goes the other direction to avoid repeating the word.“Sense” is a good clue for GET A READ ON, although I had BEAD instead for a while. READ is better. Pledging one’s TROTH is usually done these days while wearing either a tuxedo or an elaborate white dress. It means “Loyalty.” “Awacs,” or as most of the world not constrained by the New York Times style guide calls it, AWACS, refers to the Airborne Warning and Control System.“Producer of hits” for GOOGLE SEARCH seems like an odd clue. Page hits are a common metric for Web sites, but the hits are “produced” by Google only indirectly. Users click through on pages of search results. In a different sense, however, it’s literally true. The ranking Google gives your company for a specific search term can mean the difference between being a hit site and corporate death. The details of how Google decides search-results ranking are closely guarded trade secrets. Full disclosure: I also work for the company that created and operates Bing, a competing search service.If you had trouble today, I’m going to guess it was near the bottom. “Worn” is THREADBARE and the “Senate cry” is HAIL CAESAR. Yes, that senate. The hefty South-American rodent is a CAPYBARA. Females are even larger than males, weighing in at up to 145 pounds. It reminded me of the untold Sherlock Holmes tale of The Giant Rat of Sumatra, which Dr. Watson warned us was “a story for which the world is not yet prepared.” If that isn’t scary enough, a “chimera” in Greek mythology was a creature assembled from various parts of a snake, a lion and a GOAT.India.Arie has that unusual punctuation in the middle of her name but her voice is lovely.

2622	 2004	a	I believe there can be a reasoned debate about tax law, environmental policy, gun control and even abortion. But to me, gay rights should be in the same category as creationism vs. science.Most people who are antigay or creationists base their views on the mindless repetition of tradition, ignorance and prejudice, rather than on careful consideration.It is appropriate for a newspaper intended for a relatively educated audience to privilege science over creationism. Likewise, it is appropriate to privilege tolerance over bigotry, or democracy over totalitarianism.ZACK SUBINArlington, Mass., July 25, 2004
6100	 1977	a	Miriam Bockman was unanimously elected the first woman leader of the Manhattan Democratic organization yesterday in a move that signaled the transfer of political power from Mayor Beanie to Representation Edward I.

4105	 1995	a	The imports of coats from Ukraine, estimated at $30 million a year, are tiny compared with America's yearly apparel import bill of $30 billion, according to the United States Association of Importers and Apparel, a trade group. But shipments have increased sharply. In the year ended last September, Ukraine exported 88,898 dozen women's coats -- or 1,066,776 coats -- to the United States, up 155 percent from the year before, the Commerce Department said.By 1994, Ukraine's coat exports to the United States had mushroomed to such an extent that they were outstripped only by coats from the Dominican Republic and Guatemala, two countries to which the United States gives preferential trade. Under the Caribbean Basin Initiative, the Dominican Republic and Guatemala do not face quotas on women's coats.The sudden surge of Ukrainian imports brought pressure for import restraint from domestic coat makers, who were supported by Senator George Mitchell, Democrat of Maine, and the Commerce Department. Textiles and apparel remain among the most protected sectors of trade in most nations, even though the new rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will eliminate many curbs. And even without the quota, American producers are protected by a tariff of 21.5 percent on wool coat imports.The Ukrainian coat imports were classified as "disruptive" to the American women's manufacturing industry. The disruptive finding, though vague, was sufficient to justify imposing a quota in a niche of the American apparel industry where employment has declined fairly steadily for years.According to a senior official at the United States Trade Representative's office, some of the Ukrainian coats were landing in the United States at $212 a dozen. "This was not the absolute lowest, but among the lowest" price of imported coats, the official said, adding, "they're very nice looking coats." Indeed, the coats made in Ukraine have a reputation in the industry for being of higher quality than those sewn in other developing countries.In theory, the coat quota was negotiated with Ukraine's Government. But the Ukrainian officials were informed by Washington that the United States could unilaterally impose import quotas on them if they did not voluntarily accept restrictions. Besides Ukraine, the United States has quota agreements on women's wool coats with 15 other countries, including Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania and Poland.The quota on Ukrainian coats maintains imports at roughly last year's levels. The quota, the trade representative's office says, was set during negotiations with the Ukrainians at 85,000 dozen for 1995, or 1,020,000. And an extra quota of 25,000 coats, which can be added to shipments in 1995, was set for the last three months of 1994.

3622	 1998	a	A proposal to toughen drunken driving laws around the country was dealt a serious blow tonight after a House panel voted to squelch the measure by keeping it from a vote on the floor.The decision by a voice vote of the Rules Committee was a hard-fought lobbying victory for beer distributors and restaurant chains. They had argued that the proposal, which would have forced states to adopt a stricter definition of drunken driving or risk losing Federal highway funds, would have cut into their sales of alcoholic beverages. The proposal, already approved in the Senate, would have lowered the legal limit for intoxication to a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 percent, as opposed to most states' standard of 0.10 percent.The panel's decision tonight left millions of members of the group Mothers Against Drunk Driving, which has lobbied for the measure on Capitol Hill and in state legislatures for 14 years, wondering where they should turn next.By keeping the proposal off the floor, Republicans sought to fend off an emotional debate on drunken driving and block a vote on an amendment that members may have found difficult to oppose. The Senate had approved an identical amendment to its highway bill on March 4 by a 62-to-32 vote, a margin typically large enough to encourage the House to act. But with the House panel's rejection of the amendment, its chances of survival through conference between the two houses appears dim.
1046	 2013	a	PhotoSociety news was a longstanding feature of the European edition. Reports on the high society of capital cities often filled several pages. Stationed at popular resorts during the holiday season, the Herald’s reporters told colorful tales of elegant festivities and sporting events.While mostly frivolous by nature, the society columns reveal interesting facets of social change. In February 1909, for example, the Herald’s correspondent told of “the roller-skating craze” that has “spread all over London from Whitechapel to Mayfair.”“Everybody seems to have gone ‘rinking’ mad from duchesses to costers. Dozens of rinks have sprung into being like mushrooms, but the biggest and most important is in the enormous structure called Olympia, made famous years ago by Barnum and Bailey’s circus.”The story ran under pictures of high society figures, and contained the usual list of patrons, “prominent either by their titles or because they are theatrical celebrities.” But the writer picked up on a new phenomenon:“It is interesting to see how democratic English people can be when they are victims of a fad. At these rinks grand ladies and shopgirls are all on the same level, both socially and physically, as they glide around. You can’t tell them apart.”On the rink there might have been no constraint or embarrassment, but it would probably have been a very different story if the “grand ladies and shopgirls” had met in a ballroom…
6440	 1970	a	Ralph Nader asserted yester day that the United States would “become a nation of slaves” unless safeguards and human values were integrated “before it's too late” into what he called the unregulated and uncontrolled use of computers.In a wine‐ranging speech at the New York Hilton before the 25th annual convention of the 27,000‐member Association of Computing Machinery, Mr. Nader described in pessimistic terms the ramifications of a growing computer technology that, he said, is now “exclu sively in the domain of cor porate and governmental con trol.”Because “the computer and the consumer should be the major concern of somebody in society,” the consumer crusader urged his audience to begin to infuse “human considerations and values” into the use of com puters.Mr. Nader predicted that a “citizen backlash” against com puters was inevitable if their use remained completely apart from public review.
5387	 1987	a	Mr. Frampton said he hoped that the appointment of F. Dale Robertson, who has been associate chief forester, to succeed Mr. Peterson as chief would create an opportunity for ''a new vision for our National Forests.''''This vision should reflect the desires of the American people for unspoiled wilderness, clean water, wildlife and recreation,'' Mr. Frampton said. But he said he was not optimistic. 'Logging Less in the '80's'Mr. Peterson rejects the contention that there has been too much logging on his watch. ''Because of the budget crunch our programs may be somewhat out of balance,'' he said. ''Some of our recreational facilities are seriously in need of rehabilitation and some streams have become clogged up. But contrary to opinion, we are logging less in the 80's than we were in the 70's.''Contentions of excessive roadbuilding are also unfounded, Mr. Peterson says. He said that the number of miles of roads built in National Forests had gone down every year since he became chief and that many miles of logging road had been closed. As a result, he said, the forests now have 25 percent fewer miles of open road than when he became chief.Mr. Peterson also says it is simply untrue that the Forest Service is rapidly punching roads into forests so as to make them unsuitable for future wilderness designation. ''That is not on our agenda,'' he said.Ralph Max Peterson, ''Max'' to friend and foe alike, is 59 years old. He was born in Bennett, Mo., and was trained not as a forester but as a civil engineer. He later received a master's degree in water-resource and land-use planning from Harvard. 'Almost an Institution'George S. Dunlop, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for natural resources and environment, said Mr. Peterson was ''almost an institution - he is a great leader who has the tremendous respect of everyone here.'' In part because of Mr. Peterson's leadership and the people he recruited, Mr. Dunlop said, ''the Forest Service is recognized as one of the premier if not the premier Federal agencies in esprit de corps and professionalism.''

5935	 1982	a	In the future, people may get artificial hearts when their own wear out. John C. Moise is betting on it. Mr. Moise, 57, has organized a new research and development company called Nimbus Inc., based in a suburb of Sacramento, Calif. He had worked at the Aerojet-General Corporation for 27 years, the last 10 on artificial heart research, and when Aerojet decided to divest itself of the program and concentrate on defense contract work, Mr. Moise and a group of other employees stepped in.''What we essentially did was to buy the equipment being used in the program,'' Mr. Moise said yesterday. The private company also received approval from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to transfer contracts totaling $2.4 million to Nimbus from Aerojet. And it has won a new $4 million, four-year contract on its own from the Government institution.The Government, and therefore Nimbus, is concentrating on leftheart assist systems, which take over the work of failing left ventricles. ''Total heart replacement is a much trickier problem,'' Mr. Moise said.The medical profession is divided on artificial hearts, he added. ''A third would think the whole thing is crazy,'' he said. ''A third would back the left-heart assist and a third the total replacement. There's no consensus.''

5719	 1985	a	To the Editor:Carlyle C. Douglas deserves credit for bringing attention to the gravity of Bedford-Stuyvesant's lead-poisoning problem (''In Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant, Glimmers of Resurgence Are Visible,'' news story, April 19). However, the article implies the commonly held misconception that the main cause of New York City's childhood lead-poisoning cases is toddlers picking and eating lead-coated paint chips from tenement walls.Studies have shown that only about 20 percent of the city's cases are caused in this manner.A majority of the city's childhood lead-poisoning cases are related directly to the deteriorating internal conditions of the apartment houses the children inhabit. Lead dust particles from crumbling walls and ceilings fall to the floor where young children walk, crawl and play. They then inadvertently ingest the particles from the air they breath or, more commonly, by placing fingers covered with lead-paint dust into their mouths.Thus, it should not be implied that the lead-poisoning victim is in any way to blame for his or her disease (i.e., picking and eating lead paint chips). Instead, we should all begin to take account of the environmental hazards that children, living in neighborhoods such as Bedford-Stuyvesant, face during their everyday lives.ANDREW B. BORINSTEIN New York, April 20, 1985 The writer, a former research assistant for the New York Health Department's lead-poisoning-control program, is a doctoral candidate in sociology at Columbia University.

5836	 1984	a	Geraldine A. Ferraro's 22-year-old daughter, Donna Zaccaro, was heckled and booed when she criticized President Reagan's policies at a fund-raising party to welcome back the ''Doonesbury'' comic strip, an organizer said today.Jan Hollingsworth, a spokesman for the National Foundation for Children, which benefited from the dinner, said her organization was not aware that Miss Zaccaro's comments would include a strong attack on the President.''It started out with quiet boos after they realized she was getting into a heavy topic,'' Mrs. Hollingsworth said.Miss Zaccaro defended the criticism she expressed Saturday night of Mr. Reagan at the $250-a-plate dinner and said the overall response was positive. She said it was ''unfortunate'' if there was an organizer who did not know her subject matter would be political.

197	 2018	a	Alice Provensen, who illustrated and often wrote books for children for more than a half-century, helping young readers learn about animals and aviators, poems and presidents, Aesop’s fables and Chinese legends, died on April 23 in San Clemente, Calif. She was 99.Her daughter, Karen Provensen Mitchell, with whom she had lived since 2008, confirmed the death.For almost 40 years, Ms. Provensen formed half of an illustrating team that was famous in the world of children’s books. Her husband, Martin, was the other half. Together they illustrated dozens of books for young and very young readers, beginning in the 1940s, and as their careers advanced they wrote many as well.After Mr. Provensen died in 1987, Ms. Provensen was hesitant to continue her career.“When Martin died,” she told Publishers Weekly, “at first I didn’t think I would ever be able to work again.”But her daughter and an editor friend encouraged her, and she continued to write and illustrate into this decade.
4972	 1990	a	To the Editor:In ''Why Won't Mandela Renounce Violence?'' (Op-Ed, June 21), David G. Sanders attempts to criticize Nelson Mandela's position to liberate black South Africans. He fails to recognize that his forefathers were responsible for an extremely violent overthrow of their British oppressors in 1776.Furthermore, the United States wholeheartedly praised Romania's violent removal of Nicolae Ceausescu. The United States was also involved in militarily deposing Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, an action in which human life was lost. There was only praise for those actions.I am sure Mr. Sanders has not been violently beaten, like many black South Africans, just for making a statement. His civil rights are not abused daily, and he has not spent the last 27 years in prison. It seems Mr. Sanders's knowledge in this area lacks insight.VINAYAK CHATURVEDIWashington, June 21, 1990

3511	 1999	a	WHEN I bought the country acreage I now call home, the road frontage to the west of the house was edged by a couple of wild cherry trees draped with poison ivy, a random specimen or two of multiflora rose, a few elderberry bushes and a thicket of sumac.The neighbors counseled me to clear it out, a formidable chore that would have required the chain saw, heavy shears and hours of toil that I preferred to spend on other tasks that also needed doing.Seventeen years later, the fencerow -- the growth is called a fencerow even though there is no fence there and never was -- has finally made it to the top of the end-of-season chore list. Given a reasonable period of time this year between the falling of the leaves and the falling of the snow, I will hack my way through the multiflora roses and elderberries, and gingerly remove the poison ivy vines.The benefit of waiting is that I now know enough to leave the wild cherry trees alone (their fruit lures birds away from my blueberries), and to do nothing more to the sumac thicket than cut the wild brambles that threaten to obscure my view of it. What a mistake it would have been to clear out that sumac.

538	 2016	a	As Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration moves forward on plans for a new streetcar line from Queens to Brooklyn, city officials on Tuesday unveiled the different routes they are considering for the project.The $2.5 billion waterfront streetcar would run on streets in some of New York City’s most popular and crowded neighborhoods along the East River, including Williamsburg and Downtown Brooklyn. City officials plan to discuss the routes at community meetings over the next two months before selecting a path early next year.Mr. de Blasio proposed the streetcar, known as the Brooklyn Queens Connector, in February, and now New Yorkers can see where exactly it might run and the potential impact on their neighborhoods. The streetcar line, which would travel about 16 miles from Astoria in Queens to Sunset Park in Brooklyn, is the mayor’s most high-profile transportation priority and could open by 2024.In a 25-page report on the routes, city officials outlined the benefits and drawbacks of using certain streets in each neighborhood, including the width of the road and how close the street is to subway lines for riders who want to transfer. Maps also show how the streetcar could travel over bridges to cross Newtown Creek and the Gowanus Canal — a potentially expensive part of the plan if new bridges are built.

3851	 1997	a	When mothers in the United States, Sweden and Russia nuzzle their infants and croon baby talk, they are giving their babies a lot more than tender loving care, scientists have found. The women are producing highly exaggerated speech sounds that provide the basis for all subsequent learning of that language.Baby talk is much more important than people realize, said Dr. Patricia Kuhl, chairwoman of speech and hearing sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle and the lead author of a new report on the university of ''parentese'' -- the sing-song, exaggerated speech pattern that people use when talking to infants.''Parentese has a melody to it,'' Dr. Kuhl said. ''And inside this melody is a tutorial for the baby which contains exceptionally well-formed versions of the building blocks of language.''In a study published today in the journal Science, Dr. Kuhl and her colleagues found that mothers in the the three countries stretched out or exaggerated the pronunciation of three primary vowels when speaking to their infants -- ''ee,'' ''ah'' and ''oo'' -- which are common to every spoken language in the world. This vowel stretching tunes the infant's brain to the widest possible range of vowel sounds, Dr. Kuhl said. As the baby learns the vowels of its mother tongue, the ability to hear subtle vowel distinctions in other languages is gradually lost.
4689	 1992	a	THE TELEVISION SCRIPT Narrator: Bob Abrams. His record squeaky clean. His reputation beyond reproach. But Al D'Amato. Scandal after scandal. Housing grants for his friends. Contracts for his contributors. And backroom deals for his brother. A Senate ethics investigation concluded D'Amato allowed his office to be systematically misused for personal gain. Now D'Amato is attacking Bob Abrams' integrity? Come on, Al! Who do you think you're kidding? PRODUCER: Struble-Totten of Washington. ON THE SCREEN: Narration over a color picture of Abrams with newspaper mastheads and headlines. Black-and-white picture of Mr. D'Amato against an ominous-looking etching of the United States Capitol. Photograph of Mr. D'Amato with quotations from a Senate Ethics Committee report. Photograph of Mr. D'Amato with headlines of negative stories about him. Full-frame photograph of Mr. D'Amato for the final narration. ACCURACY: The statements referring to Mr. Abrams were taken from opinions on the editorial pages of the Buffalo News and the Troy Record. The quotations themselves are correct. "Scandal" is, of course, a word subject to interpretation -- it is indeed true that friends of Mr. D'Amato's, as well as his cousin, have gotten housing grants, and that contributors, including several defense firms, have gotten government contracts after Mr. D'Amato helped them. But Mr. D'Amato routinely says he helps all New Yorkers, whether they support him or not, and he has not been convicted of any crime. The "personal gain" cited in a Senate Ethics Committee investigation was not Mr. D'Amato's, but his brother's: the committee said Senator D'Amato had "conducted the business of his office in an improper and inappropriate manner" by allowing the brother, Armand, to use his office and official stationery for lobbying work on behalf of a client who was seeking a defense contract. The committee did not substantiate other allegations of improper influence on the Senator's part, although it said its investigation was hampered because about half its witnesses refused to testify after pleading Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination. SCORECARD: This ad is the Abrams campaign's response to recent D'Amato commercials that accused him of improper fundraising practices. The "Come on, Al" line at the end evokes the "Really, Bob!" conclusion of one D'Amato ad that mocks Mr. Abrams's claims of integrity. The ad will probably quiet fears of some Abrams supporters that the Democratic candidate was not fighting back and was allowing Mr. D'Amato to define him to voters. But it carries risks as well: for one thing, it reinforces the notion that somebody is out there criticizing Mr. Abrams on ethical grounds. And as with most negative ads, it gives free air time to the opponent: it is Mr. D'Amato whose face is on the screen during most of the commercial.
3517	 1999	a	''The differential is so small, and the number of women at selective colleges is more than the number of men, so I don't think it has had much of an effect,'' he said.But Monty Neill, executive director of Fairtest, an advocacy group based in Cambridge, Mass., said the gap was ''clearly significant because college admissions are in part decided on these tests and a lot of special programs and scholarships are largely awarded based on test scores.''''Our view is that the test itself is biased,'' she added.White students also continued to do better than most underrepresented minorities. White students showed a one-point gain on the verbal test and no gains on the math test over last year's results. Scores for black students remained the same on the verbal test and fell four points in math.Overall scores for Hispanic students were also lower, except for Puerto Rican students, whose scores were up three points in verbal and one point in math.The Educational Testing Service, the company that administers the College Board tests, is in the early stages of developing a formula to help colleges adjust scores for members of minorities and other students who have fewer educational advantages, providing a kind of handicapping system.Those efforts, College Board officials said yesterday, did not suggest that the current scores were less valid.''Looking at SAT scores in a broader context is something admissions people have done for years,'' said Gretchen Rigol, vice president for special projects at the College Board. ''Though there are lots of people interested in this research, it is far from being operational.''
3933	 1996	a	With Mr. Claudio's face smeared with charcoal to symbolize the toll taken by the previous year, the group accompanied the mule as it took on the sorrows and burdens of the neighborhood. And when they ended their journey at midnight -- hoarse, tired and tipsy -- they would burn the mula, their raggedy clothes and their worries, starting the year anew.Theirs is the tradition of the parranda, a caroling party rare in New York, yet thriving in the snow and cold, luring old ladies to shout excitedly from their windows. As the carolers slapped hand drums and tambourines, the mule swayed down blocks lined with graffiti memorials, gated windows and empty lots. They dropped in on beauty parlors, bodegas, firehouses and homes, staying long enough at each stop to bring season's greetings, as well as receive offerings of a few dollars in an upturned drum and perhaps a drink to brace for the journey.THE custom has journeyed from Puerto Rico, though it is fading there as crime has discouraged the carolers from their rounds. Perhaps it is more needed in the Bronx; the carolers know that, although they are far from home, buried beneath their sweaters, shirts and coats beat hearts strong with the rhythms of their youth."This is a seed that grows where we plant it," said Jose (Chema) Soto, who has led this ragtag group for more than 15 years. "In any country we're in, even on the moon, on the moon we'd take out the mule."A few days earlier, Chema had finished sewing the mule costume inside Rincon Criollo, a wooden shack that is the headquarters in New York for the traditional music known as plena. Here, in a room lined with portraits of Puerto Ricans ranging from Roberto Clemente to Fernando Ferrer, the mule lay limp atop a freezer.

4009	 1996	a	President Boris N. Yeltsin failed again today to make any public appearances, fueling deepening concern over his health just three days before the presidential runoff election.Mr. Yeltsin, who is 65 and has a long history of health problems, has not been seen in public since Wednesday. He missed his last major chance to campaign today, when he did not appear at a large party sponsored by a Moscow newspaper to which he had been invited. By law, campaigning must stop on Monday.Mr. Yeltsin traveled from his country home outside the capital on Saturday for a short working day in the Kremlin. Television news programs showed him smiling but looking weary and weak.His Communist opponent, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, has seized on his virtual disappearance from view to remind voters how frail Mr. Yeltsin, who has had two serious episodes of heart disease in the last year, often seems.
3879	 1997	a	To the Editor:When I read that a fraternity pledge at Louisiana State University had overdosed on alcohol after drinking at a bar, I knew the bar had to be Murphy's (news article, Aug. 27). That's Greek central at L.S.U. When I was a student there, the alternative crowd hung out on Chimes Street, near Murphy's, and it was common for fraternity men who got soused at Murphy's to speed down Chimes in their B.M.W.'s, hurling beer bottles and insults at punks, hippies, gay students and others who didn't look like them.Alcohol just exacerbates the rat-pack arrogance of fraternity men and brings it aggressively to the surface. I am sorry that a student died at my alma mater, but I will not be sorry if it leads to the demise of the L.S.U. fraternity system.ROD DREHERFort Lauderdale, Fla., Aug. 28, 1997
2955	 2002	a	In a move that CNN said was unrelated to the controversy, it also began a five-part series on the victims of suicide bombers on the CNN service shown on Israel and around the world, CNN International, with Wolf Blitzer as its host.Taken together, the moves were interpreted by Israeli and Palestinian officials, media critics and reporters covering the conflict as an appeasement of CNN's critics in Israel and the United States.And they have led to bad feelings among some inside CNN. ''It appears as if we're in an unseemly rush to try to fix things, and I think we're going to dig ourselves into a deeper hole if we continue this course,'' said one CNN staff member in Jerusalem, who said complaints from Israelis to the office there were coming through loudest and with the most ferocity.CNN executives said they were not appeasing critics, but, rather, setting the record straight on Mr. Turner and emphasizing that CNN's coverage was fair. They said two suicide bombings on two consecutive days last month that killed 26 in Jerusalem -- the same week Mr. Turner's comments were published -- persuaded them to put together the series on Israeli terrorism victims.''People who are really examining the issues closely would see CNN is doing first-rate journalistic work,'' Mr. Jordan said. ''And we are not going to kowtow to one side or the other.''Still, the series drew complaints from Palestinians. ''Do we have to pay for the statements of Ted Turner?'' said Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator. ''I can't believe that CNN is giving five segments a half-hour each to the Israelis without the courtesy of showing one segment on the Palestinian victims. I hate to see that the pressure on CNN has affected their objectivity, as reflected in the Blitzer report.'' He said CNN should do a similar series on civilian Palestinian victims of Israeli military operations. CNN said it regularly covered the plights of Palestinian victims.For CNN's many critics in Israel, however, the series was a long time coming. ''What's happened here in the past two years -- the coverage was not according to journalistic standards,'' a government official said, adding that during Israel's recent military campaign to root terrorists out of Palestinian neighborhoods, ''CNN took almost totally the Palestinian line.''

4497	 1993	a	Hampton had been out of camp for 13 days and was fined a total of $52,000."I did what I had to do to get them to see I was serious about a new contract," Hampton said. His agent, Ralph Cindrich of Pittsburgh, said Hampton's no-show was an "attention getter." Said Cindrich: "He showed up on Friday night and told the coaches that his attitude was good, that he was upbeat, and he was ready to play."As of several months ago, the top five running backs in the league made on average about $1.7 million a year. Thurman Thomas, Buffalo's superb running back, recently signed a four-year, $13.5 million deal to make him the highest paid running back in the league. For now. The Cowboys' Emmitt Smith is currently holding out and wants more money than Thomas (actually he wants about $4 million a season).Right now, the highest paid player in the N.F.L. is San Francisco quarterback Steve Young, who makes over $5 million a year.The debate around the league focuses on the questions: Is a running back worth that kind of money? Where will Hampton's salary end up? Right now, it's unclear, but when all is said and done, he will be much richer than now. He's earned it.Hampton, a 1990 first-round draft pick, has rushed for 1,000 yards in each of the past two seasons, making him only the second Giants player to do so (Joe Morris was the other in 1985 and 1986). He has 2,655 career rushing yards in just three seasons, already good enough for the No. 8 spot on the Giants' career list. And this is only his fourth season.
4133	 1995	a	Mr. Shapiro tried to trip up the witness by asking him whether he had seen the limousine driver who had in fact shown up at Mr. Simpson's house only after Mr. Cale had gone to bed.The defense lawyer also noted that the Bronco was really only a few inches from the curb, not the 18 inches Mr. Cale said it was."I don't think it's a paragon of parallel parking," the witness insisted. Mr. Simpson glared stonily at his neighbor as he testified.Mr. Cale said that although he had been following a case a bit, it was only earlier this year that he realized the position of the Bronco was an issue in it. He conceded, however, that he paid particular attention to Mr. Simpson's house."Mr. Simpson is a celebrity, certainly one of the most well-known people in the neighborhood," said the witness, a self-employed private investor, and Mr. Simpson's house was "a focal point" in the neighborhood, particularly when it is decorated with Christmas lights.Anxious to miss the media blitzkrieg unleashed even on bit players in the Simpson drama, Mr. Cale would not give his address. He said only that it took him only three or four minutes to return home from his walk, "depending upon what the dog was doing." That brought laughs from a few jurors.In his statement to the police last June, Mr. Simpson equivocated on when he last used the Bronco. Initially, he said that he had last used it "in the morning, in the afternoon," and that once he returned from his daughter's dance recital around 6:30 P.M., he did not go out in it again.
4829	 1991	a	In bringing on a couple identified as Nelson and Winnie Mandela, the movie seemed to promise that these pooh-bahs were in for it, too -- and at least one of them is eminently vulnerable. But no. Mrs. Mandela's association with youths who apparently went in for blood sports was not mentioned. And there was no gag about Mr. Mandela being henpecked.The Mandelas are protected by race, as humor-proof a vest as is available these days. It takes a target like the Rev. Al Sharpton to bring out the darts of ridicule. One of the few funny spots in the messy movie version of "The Bonfire of the Vanities" was the appearance of a portly, gussied-up rabble-rouser whose resemblance to the Reverend Sharpton was sheer, cathartic ridicule. At the moment heavy indignation is being directed at Dr. Leonard Jeffries Jr., the chairman of the African-American studies department at City College, for his unflattering remarks about Jews, Italians and whites in general. But demands for his demotion endow him with seriousness. For the thoroughgoing ridiculist, nobody is all that serious, and here, if anywhere, is a figure whose theories might easily be grist for mockery, but never in prime time.The number of excluded subjects continues to grow. On the tube these days all groups are taken pretty much at their own estimate; more and more subjects are handled with a tenderness that can bring on queasiness.Granted, there is nothing funny about abortion, rape, AIDS, homelessness or the Holocaust, but should that exempt activists on all sides from ridicule? And do all programs on those subjects -- and there are many -- have to be so holier than thou? Each exhalation of Elie Wiesel is received by interviewers as coming from Moses on the mountain. Even to make such an observation opens one to a charges of gross insensitivity to a 20th-century tragedy, but can't one differentiate between the fact of the Holocaust and its exploitation?Isn't there something worth ridiculing in the way public television, that fount of responsibility, treats Indians, pro-choicers and all other politically correct groups with the same reverence that it gives to whales.Beware. When Joseph Epstein, the editor of The American Scholar, was exposed as having made rude jokes about feminists and lesbians, Joyce Carol Oates demanded his resignation. (The jokes were written for The Hudson Review, a publication presumably read by sophisticated people; hearing them uttered on television is unimaginable.)To mock truly divisive issues and exquisitely sensitive groups requires a respect for the maturity of the mass audience that has never been earned, or at least a hope that the level of maturity might be raised -- and who wants to take a chance on that? So the medium can be expected to tread carefully, avoid offense and so make its contribution to public order and even to good feelings. The gain is by no means negligible, but the price is a humorless leveling of political discourse. The loss can be measured in the light and the light-heartedness that ridicule might bring to a dreary political time.

5846	 1984	a	A Federal district judge has refused to swear in seven people as United States citizens because they could not speak adequate English, even though they apparently were exempt from the language requirement, an immigration official says.Judge Kendall Sharp told the Immigration and Naturalization Service that he had refused to grant citizenship to the seven because he did not believe in a law that waives the English-language requirement for immigrants at least 50 years old who have lived in the United States for at least 20 years, according to George Waldroup, an I.N.S. spokesman in Miami.Other immigrants must be able to speak and write English to become citizens. The seven who were denied citizenship will get another hearing, Mr. Waldroup said.

5202	 1988	a	For decades, lawyers have been talking about the desirability of a national bar examination, but progress in that direction has been painfully slow.''The practice of law in America is interstate these days, but the bar exam is a hanging-on from days gone by, an old states' rights issue,'' said Norman Krivosha, former Chief Justice of the Nebraska Supreme Court, who has long argued for a national bar exam.This year, for the first time, the mechanism for such an examination will be in place.In most states, the bar examination is administered over two days, with multiple-choice questions asked on one day and essays written on the other. Since 1972 each state has had the option of replacing its multiple-choice test with 200 computer-graded questions. All butLouisiana, Washington, Indiana and Iowa are using the questions in the multistate test.

1643	 2009	a	TAMPA, Fla. — Larry Fitzgerald and Santonio Holmes are fast, but working on the Super Bowl sideline can require quick feet, too.Late in the fourth quarter, four men walked onto the field carrying a black gym bag full of Steelers victory caps and T-shirts. But when Fitzgerald raced 64 yards to put the Cardinals ahead, 23-20, with 2 minutes 37 seconds to go, the men sprinted back into the stadium tunnel. Moments later they returned with Cardinals victory gear.They got another workout when Holmes scored the winning touchdown with 35 seconds to go, running back down the tunnel and into a closet to fetch the bags a third time.

2447	 2005	a	WASHINGTON, July 31 - Senior American military officials said Sunday that the loss of access to an important air base in Uzbekistan could be offset without hurting combat operations and relief missions in Afghanistan.Uzbekistan formally ordered the United States to leave the air base within 180 days in protest over a United Nations operation on Friday to relocate Uzbek refugees who had fled during an uprising in May."We are and have been working a plan to adjust without K-2," one senior American commander in the region said in an e-mail message, referring to the Uzbek installation, Karshi-Khanabad Air Base.A senior Air Force officer concurred, saying: "It's not a big deal, especially if they continue to grant us overflight rights. Even without the overflight, we're still O.K. It's just a longer routing going into Afghanistan."
1761	 2009	a	Sara Krulwich/The New York Times Sara Krulwich/The New York Times The Broadway cast of “Billy Elliot the Musical” is about to lose another cast member who plays the title character — only this time it’s someone who has reached the age of majority. Stephen Hanna, the former New York City Ballet dancer who portrays the role of Billy’s older self in that musical, will rejoin the company of City Ballet as a guest artist for its coming 2009-2010 winter season. In a news release, City Ballet said on Thursday that Mr. Hanna, who departed for the Broadway show last year, will assume his former rank as principal dancer when he returns to the company. Mr. Hanna joined the corps of City Ballet in 1997; he was promoted to soloist in 2004 and made a principal dancer in 2005. A press representative for City Ballet said that Mr. Hanna would depart “Billy Elliot” at the end of October. A representative for the Broadway musical confirmed Mr. Hanna’s departure and said that a replacement for him had not yet been determined.
4145	 1995	a	Clinton Imposing a Ban On All U.S. Trade With IranPresident Clinton said last night that he would cut off all United States trade and investment with Iran, including purchases by American companies that account for more than 20 percent of that country's oil exports, in a further effort to isolate it as an "inspiration and paymaster to terrorists."Mr. Clinton, speaking at a World Jewish Congress dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in Manhattan, said he would sign an executive order outlining the ban this week, to take effect in 30 days. It would apply to all American companies and their foreign subsidiaries and would eliminate virtually all remaining United States exports to Iran, which totaled $326 million last year, mostly in farm, industrial and oilfield equipment. A1. At 3 A.M., the Choices Continue to GrowA growing number of companies are offering a variety of services at all hours. From corporate office parks where workers can get their shoes repaired, their car's oil changed or a new suit or set of pots and pans without leaving work, to vendors at railroad stations who sell hot gourmet meals to doctors who will see patients before sunrise and chiropractors who make office calls, the margins of ordinary commerce are stretching into some extraordinary territory.

5770	 1985	a	In Cape Town, he said, there would likely be a similar assembly soon, alluding to the violence there that has claimed at least 29 lives this week. Mr. Tshwete, a former political prisoner who spent 15 years on Robben Island, a jail in the ocean off Cape Town, told the crowd that the forces of resistence were not asking President Botha to rule blacks fairly but, instead, that blacks rule be allowed to rule themselves.He warned the audience that, regardless of where they were in South Africa, they were in a ''war zone,'' and that acts of violence by the Government's security forces simply redoubled the efforts of the Government's opponents.''We will use practically everything,'' he said, asserting that the resistence forces were prepared to set the country ablaze.Advocates Fighting Back''We are going to kick them, we are going to use our fists if it comes to that, we are going to even shoot them if it comes to that,'' he said. ''We are not going to be killed like this and say there is room for nonviolent struggle in South Africa.''We can't allow a situation where our people disappear at night and still talk in terms of nonviolent struggle,'' he continued. ''Apartheid is a violent system.''Mr. Tshwete, whom the Government had banished from South Africa and who is supposed to be restricted to a remote corner of the so-called homeland of Ciskei, made similar strong statements at the funeral on Aug. 11 for Victoria Mxenge, a civil rights lawyer who was gunned down and axed earlier this month by four unidentified assailants outside her home in a Durban township. Many black activists here have said they believed she was killed by agents of the Government security forces.Mrs. Mxenge's funeral sparked the rage here in Duncan Village, as it did in many other black townships. Youths of this township returned home from her funeral that evening and immediately burned down the Government Administration office, beer halls, and the homes of some community councilors, who are widely viewed as puppets of the Government.

5292	 1988	a	That strange hybrid of politics and entertainment, the televised political drama, made its explosive debut here this week, bringing with it spontaneity, name calling, rapid-fire dialogue and the oddly American phenomenon of pop political stardom.What the Army-McCarthy hearings did for Joseph Welch, what the Watergate hearings did for John Dean and Sam Ervin and what the Iran-contra hearings did for Oliver North, the 19th Communist Party conference is doing for the likes of Vladimir I. Melnikov, Vladimir P. Kabaidze and Mikhail A. Ulyanov.For an actor like Mr. Ulyanov, who makes a living playing Lenin, the consummate politician, on stage, stardom was easily won -the more so because his straight man in an unexpected dialogue Wednesday was Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Communist Party's General Secretary. #4 Accused of Taking Bribes But some of the most dramatic moments of the conference included in the highlights broadcast so far were grabbed by Mr. Melnikov - a wooden regional politician who today called two Politburo members the brakes on the wheels of political reform - and Mr. Kabaidze, a factory manager whose thoughts bounced around like the ball in a pinball game but who electrified his audience with an indictment of the bureaucracy-bound economy.And you could almost hear the gasps that must have echoed in cramped living rooms from Uzhgorod to Yakutsk when Vitaly A. Korotich, editor of the feisty weekly magazine Ogonyok, handed Mr. Gorbachev documents that he said contained the names of four bribe-takers, all of them delegates to the conference.

1984	 2007	a	About a month ago, the Denver Broncos’ starting cornerback Darrent Williams said he looked forward to returning to Fort Worth, Tex., in the off-season to warn young people in his hometown about staying away from violence and drugs. Williams never got home. Hours after the Broncos lost to the San Francisco 49ers to be knocked from the playoff race, Williams was shot to death in what the police said was a drive-by shooting in downtown Denver early on New Year’s Day.Williams, 24, was riding in a stretch Hummer limousine early this morning when, just after 2 a.m., a vehicle pulled up beside the moving limousine and sprayed it with gunfire. Three people, including Williams, an unidentified man and an unidentified woman, were hit inside the limousine. The man, whom police said was not a Broncos player, was treated and released. The woman remained in the hospital, but her injuries are not considered life-threatening and the police said she will be released in a few days.In a midday briefing Monday, held just feet from where the bullet-riddled Hummer remained after it veered into a snowbank after the shooting, the Denver police said that an argument broke out at a nightclub where Williams and others were attending a New Year’s Eve party. The club is a few blocks from the site of the shooting. The altercation was not directly between Williams and someone else, said the police spokesman Sonny Jackson, but between two groups of people — one of them Williams’s group — and did not involve a physical confrontation. The police spokesman said other people had been in the limousine but were not injured. He declined to identify them.Several Denver-area news organizations reported that Broncos wide receiver Javon Walker was in the limousine. There were as many as a dozen bullet holes visible in the limousine and one window was blown out. The police are looking for a large white sports utility vehicle — a Suburban or Tahoe — with darkly tinted windows that they believe was involved in the shooting.Advertisement Continue reading the main story“We don’t believe that it’s random,” Jackson said.The police do not believe any shots were fired from Williams’s limousine and they found no weapons inside the limousine, Jackson said.

2312	 2006	a	Is Time Warner still attached to AOL? That was the gist of a question that Credit Suisse analyst William Drewry threw to the media giant’s top executives in Wednesday’s earnings conference call. The query was partly inspired by recent comments from AOL chief executive Jonathan Miller to a British newspaper, in which he suggested that Time Warner might eventually consider splitting off the online unit.The response to Mr. Drewry’s question was a tag-team effort from Time Warner president Jeff Bewkes and Time Warner chief executive Richard Parsons, who took turns praising AOL’s importance to the company but stopped short of calling it indispensable.Mr. Parsons told The New York Times’ Richard Siklos that the early results of a new strategy to make AOL a free service financed by advertising fitted well with the company’s other advertising-supported businesses like cable networks and magazine publishing.“As I sometimes say, ‘Everywhere it rains, I want to have a bucket,’ ” Mr. Parsons said. “We need to have this in our kit bag because this is where money is going.”Mr. Bewkes said on the call that AOL is “definitely a core asset for the company and growing really well” and observed that Mr. Miller’s comments were made just after Time Warner shed some of its European Internet-access businesses. “We would all say that we always evaluate any alternatives that are more profitable in the long run,” Mr. Bewkes said. “The long run is key to making that assessment.”On the call, Mr. Parsons went on at some length about how AOL helps Time Warner tie together the online initiatives of all its products, from People magazine to CNN to HBO.“AOL,” Mr. Parsons said, “can be sometimes a partner in that and sometimes offer some assistance in terms of insights into that. But each of these businesses has to have its own strategy for how it is going to meld the digital opportunities the technologies present.”“So,” he concluded, “I am not 100 percent sure exactly what musings that Jon Miller [expressed], but it is a core asset, and I think we have got it on the right track.”Go to Article from The New York Times »Go to Transcript of Conference Call from SeekingAlpha »Go to Earlier Item from DealBook »
1341	 2011	a	Slide 1 of 14,After an impressive college career at Louisiana State, Shaquille O'Neal, center, was selected as the first pick in the 1992 draft. His N.B.A. career would go on to span 19 years and include four N.B.A. titles and an MVP award. But his life off the court drew plenty of attention as well.
3508	 1999	a	Standing on a ballroom stage in Las Vegas, Nev., earlier this year, Herman Cain, president of the National Restaurant Association, sang to his members, crooning in a rich baritone: ''If I can see it, I can do it; if I just believe, there's nothing to it.''I believe I can fly; I believe I can touch the sky!''Not surprisingly, the unusual performance from the industry's top lobbyist raised a few eyebrows among the restaurateurs in the audience, who were there for an association convention. But in truth, Mr. Cain had reason to crow, because the restaurant industry is flush.Americans are eating out more often than ever before. Average check prices are higher than they have ever been. More than 10.2 million people are employed in restaurants, more than at any time in the past. And total industry sales are expected to reach a record high this year, $354 billion.And yet, association lobbyists managed to convince House Republicans this summer that restaurants were suffering enduring harm from the Government's decision in 1993 to reduce the tax deductibility of business meals, to 50 percent from 80 percent. The House tax cut bill, passed earlier this month, includes a heavily lobbied provision that raises it back to 80 percent. The tax bill that passed the Senate on Friday does not contain the provision, meaning more lobbying lies ahead.

5378	 1987	a	So, why aren't Ford and the other American auto manufacturers jumping up and down with joy? First of all, we probably erred in not pointing out that what we really meant was manufacturing cars in the United States from largely American-made parts and components - not merely assembling ''made in Japan'' auto kits in Tennessee, Kentucky or Ohio. NOW, about 93 percent of Ford's domestic vehicle content comes from North America. Unfortunately, that is not the case for the North American auto industry overall.In 1970, the average domestically manufactured content stood at 87 percent. Now, that percentage stands at about 73. The projection for 1990 has average American content falling to 65 percent. This drop translates into 200,000 jobs lost in auto manufacturing between 1970 and 1990 and another 400,000 jobs in allied industries. This is a dangerous trend that is undermining our industrial and technological base. And it is happening in numerous other key manufacturing sectors as well.To make matters worse, Japanese and Korean cars will also be assembled in Canada for shipment into the United States - aggravating trade relations all the way around.When we look to the future, we see projections that, by 1990, Japan will be producing 8.3 million more motor vehicles than its domestic market will absorb. Where will they go? More than 30 nations have import restrictions on motor vehicles, making it logical to expect an even greater competitive crush for share in the highly profitable American market. Even though American automakers' productivity has improved by 6 percent a year over the last six years -proving that we can compete -something has to give.While the trade deficit is expected to drop this year, it will still remain alarmingly large. Because of its size, the bilateral deficit with Japan gives us special reason for concern. But there are some other worries that are not far behind. The bilateral deficit with Taiwan is already up to $15 billion. South Korea's aggressive export plans have turned that country into a surplus nation overnight. And these nations show little inclination to adjust their substantially undervalued currencies.Whether for reasons of commerce, world politics or common defense, Japan is important to us. So are South Korea, Taiwan and Europe. We benefit if our trading partners grow strong - but not if they grow strong at our great expense.Our trading partners have to understand our position. And the Federal Government, likewise, must make correcting the trade deficit a top priority. Almost every foreign governmment weighs the impact of its decisions on the industrial sector. That is not the case here. Why shouldn't it be?

Mr. Mayfield was arrested May 6 and then released from prison last week after Spanish authorities matched the print to the Algerian suspect, Daoud Ouhnane, 34.In the warrant, issued Friday, Mr. Ouhnane is charged with 190 counts of murder in the train bombings and with belonging to a terrorist organization.
5357	 1988	a	Gwendolyn Cafritz, a leading Washington hostess, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in the capital. She was 78 years old.The widow of Morris Cafritz, a wealthy real estate entrepreneur, Mrs. Cafritz glittered on the capital's social scene in the 1950's and 1960's. As president of the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, she oversaw annual contributions of about $6 million to local community and arts organizations.Mrs. Cafritz combined wealth, effervescence and numerous contacts in business and government into a potent concoction of lavish entertainments that, in Washington, are as much a part of political life as sessions of Congress.Initially, she competed with Pearl Mesta as Washington's premier hostess, the two vying to snare the most prominent guests. After Mrs. Mesta was appointed Ambassador to Luxembourg in 1949, Mrs. Cafritz undertook her campaign in earnest. A four-page account in Life magazine depicted her favorite summer soiree - one or two hundred guests, in evening dress, gathered for mint juleps and steaks on the barbecue in her backyard overlooking all of Washington.

3332	 2000	a	Ending a conflict over the fate of a forest rich in both wood and wildlife, loggers, biologists and the government of Gabon have agreed to keep bulldozers and chain saws out of a 1,900-square-mile reserve with the highest density of large mammals ever recorded in a tropical rain forest.The deal includes a slight redrawing of the boundaries of Gabon's Lope Reserve, subtracting 400 square miles of land on the southeastern flank that holds the richest stands of valuable okoume trees, and adding about 200 square miles of previously unprotected terrain that includes remote upland forests that have only rarely, if ever, felt the footfall of a human.Several biologists working in the region say the net loss of land is worth it. The area opened to logging had been farmed less than 200 years ago and so is relatively recent growth. In contrast, they say, the newly protected area, which was to have been cut by Malaysian and French companies, is a priceless reservoir of biological riches that is thought to have been essentially undisturbed for the last 10,000 years.More important, they say, the agreement -- signed last month by the country's major logging companies, the government, and a variety of private environmental groups -- finally brings meaning to the word reserve, with the government and loggers committing for the first time never to violate the new boundaries.

4603	 1992	a	"Clinton is getting desperate," Mr. Brown said, speaking on his way into a meeting with the editorial board of The Daily News. Earlier, he said, Mr. Clinton had rejected his call for more frequent debates, "but now he gets into trouble and wants to have them. Maybe that's progress.""This is not a campaign against Clinton," Mr. Brown added. "This is a campaign to make justice the watchword of American politics. So there." At last night's debate, Mr. Brown was applauded several times when he urged the country to make a "moral commitment" to rebuilding the inner city.Yet despite Mr. Clinton's call for six debates, and Mr. Brown's apparent acquiesence, it was unclear yesterday when or even whether they would actually take place. Clinton campaign staff members said yesterday's meeting with mayors counted as one debate, and the debate last night at Lehman College in the Bronx counted as another. Another debate is planned for Sunday morning at the WNBC-TV studio in Manhattan, and a fourth encounter is scheduled for Monday on the "Donahue" program on NBC. As for the other two, aides to both Mr. Brown and Mr. Clinton said these had yet to be scheduled. Indications of Tight RaceThe Clinton camp's newfound enthusiasm for debates is a clear reflection of mounting worries at campaign headquarters. Aides to Governor Clinton say their private polls show the race in New York to be close. And although it is unclear whether the campaign is accurately representing its polls, or simply using them to dampen expectations, independent polls also suggest that the race could be tight.A poll published on Tuesday in The Buffalo News shows that 40 percent of New York Democrats favor Mr. Clinton, 34 percent favor Mr. Brown and 26 percent say they are undecided. The poll, which has a margin of sampling error of five percentage points, was conducted March 27-29.Mr. Clinton's strategy for countering bad news in New York with debates that limit the influence of the press is similar to the one he tried in New Hampshire before that state's primary on Feb. 18. When accusations of marital infidelity and manipulation of his draft status sent his polls sagging, Mr. Clinton bought half-hour blocks of television time and staged his own forums with voters. Twists of LogicAides to the Governor said yesterday that they had looked into buying such television time in New York as well, but had rejected the idea as impractical because of costs and scheduling.

2550	 2004	a	Jesus Chavez will go home to Austin, Tex., on Monday without the World Boxing Council junior lightweight championship, but with newfound esteem.Chavez lost his 130-pound title to Erik Morales by a unanimous decision on Saturday night but fought almost the entire 12 rounds using mostly one hand. He injured his right shoulder in the second round.''That was one of the most courageous performances I've ever seen,'' said Johnny Bos, a New York fight manager who watched the bout on HBO. ''That's the kind of thing that gives credence to this game, that makes it worthwhile.''Fighters have been injured and kept going many times; it happens almost every time Arturo Gatti and Floyd Mayweather Jr. fight. But Chavez, who did not seem to have a chance to win after the opening round, when he hurt Morales with a right hand to the chin, showed special grit.
2590	 2004	a	Sports authorities are moving aggressively, as they should, to block any athletes who have been using illegal performance-enhancing drugs from the American Olympic team. The doping of athletes so that they can train harder, recover from injuries faster and perform better has become such an international scandal that fans no longer know which records are legitimate and which are the fruit of chemistry. But as the United States Anti-Doping Agency casts its investigative net wider and relies on less conclusive forms of evidence than in the past, its own performance will be on trial. There is some danger that its zealous crackdown could ensnare some innocent athletes and bar them from a once-in-a-lifetime chance at Olympic gold and the endorsement opportunities that can bring.Our own sense is that authorities are on the right track in broadening the kinds of evidence they are willing to consider beyond the traditional urine tests for prohibited drugs. The sad fact is that the cheaters who use banned substances have gotten good at outwitting the testers by using masking agents or designing new drugs that are undetectable by current testing protocols. The latest example is a newly designed drug, THG, whose very existence was unknown until an unidentified track coach supplied a sample and an Olympics laboratory devised a test for it. The American national shot-put champion and two hammer throwers have since been banned for testing positive for THG, and a British relay team was stripped of a world championship silver medal after one of its runners tested positive for THG.Now the agency is turning to somewhat softer forms of evidence, mostly generated through a federal grand jury investigation of a California laboratory whose top officials have been indicted for supplying steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs to dozens of athletes, including some of the nation's top track and field competitors. The evidence includes such items as training schedules with coded notations that may indicate banned drugs, checks from athletes to the laboratory and e-mail messages or files mentioning athletes or their coaches. The documents may need corroboration by insiders who know what the notations mean, and they may fall short of proving that an athlete actually ingested a banned substance that was prescribed.Still, the anti-doping agency has already scored a notable success. Faced with the incriminating evidence, Kelli White, a champion sprinter, fessed up, agreed to cooperate with investigators and was suspended for two years. But Marion Jones, another star sprinter and an Olympic gold medalist, whose name surfaced in the investigation, has proclaimed her innocence and insisted that only a positive drug test should be considered proof of cheating.

356	 2017	a	“Jezebels” is the name of the brothel Offred and Fred find themselves at. (The men of Gilead obviously don’t believe in subtlety.) “It’s like walking into the past, don’t you think?” Fred says. It’s more like a warped image of the past. The women are in various states of undress, their bodies covered in glitter, makeup, leather and sequins. The one thing they all share is a hollow look in their eyes that communicates the precarious situation they’re forced into. Some of them are former prostitutes, but several of them were also professors, journalists, lawyers and acclaimed chefs. What unites them all is an understanding of their own worth and autonomy. It isn’t any surprise that Gilead would shuttle the most intelligent and successful women to a fate such as this. When Offred catches sight of Moira across the room, the episode becomes electrifying. The most moving scene is when they finally get to talk after Offred slips out of Fred’s hotel room.Unfortunately, we receive no flashback to Moira’s time from right after she parted ways with Offred at the train station. Instead we get a few minutes in which Moira is able to recount what happened. Apparently, she was able to make her way to a Quaker family that had a safe house. She made her way through the underground that provides refuge for handmaids trying to escape. But for Moira, escape became impossible when her associates were killed. She was given a choice: the colonies or Jezebels.Moira tries to soften the story with jokes and nonchalance. But what happens at Jezebels is a form of ritualized rape that’s just as harrowing as what the handmaids experience. This has all the makings of a gripping story, so it’s a shame that Moira hasn’t gotten an episode that explores her perspective as a black lesbian. Why would Luke get an entire episode to himself rather than Moira? Why is Nick given flashbacks but not her? Samira Wiley is utterly captivating, but her performance is not enough to distract me from a troubling issue: For a show so concerned with the fates of women oppressed by a sexist, fascist dystopia, “The Handmaid’s Tale” spends far too much time exploring the perspectives of its male characters.“We’re alone, June,” Moira warns. “Just take care of yourself.” But Offred has other plans. She’s been radicalized by her time in Gilead. In her closet, she adds a companion message to the Latin inscription carved by the previous Offred: “You are not alone.” In doing so, Offred refutes the cynicism that Moira is using to survive. It’s one of the many inspiring moments that “The Handmaid’s Tale” loves to end on. But it’s not a moment that feels earned.
277	 2018	a	This is a task we began to undertake, at least partially, in Chile. Thanks to an aggressive energy agenda set in 2014, during my second term as president, we have tripled the quantity of renewable energies in our matrix and lowered prices from $130 to $32 per megawatt hour. Before 2014, not only were we dependent on energy imported from other countries, we were also at the mercy of long, severe droughts. Since then, we have harnessed the power of the sun and the wind in our deserts and along our coastlines, and made use of steam from deep inside our volcanoes via geothermal plants. We increased the area of ocean waters under state protection to preserve our fishing resources and the coastline ecosystem. By working with the private sector, we were also able to increase land protection to an area the size of Switzerland, which opens up enormous possibilities in the development of sustainable tourism. We are also investing in the future with the first green taxes in the region, and the prohibition of plastic bags.We have demonstrated that productive models can evolve. As people have discovered in Iceland and Costa Rica, we have found that reducing emissions is good business. And we have shown that all countries, small and big, can spearhead relevant solutions to environmental challenges.But if we really want global transformation, we cannot expect each country to do the same thing, and do it on its own. We must commit our collective energies to defending the common good, and finding a balance between economic growth, job creation and environmental demands. We fail if we continue to do things as usual. Such continuity has become a fatal path amid the explosive growth of populations, the growing demand for energy and our dangerous consumption habits. International cooperation, such as efforts like the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, provide a framework to coordinate efforts, support laggard nations and suggest alternatives.Image Michelle Bachelet Credit... Presidency of the Republic of ChileBut we also need to move forward with a strategy — much as the United States did with the Marshall Plan, offering economic aid to Europe after World War II — that speeds up our actions, allows viable investments to make the difference and, among other things, absorbs the risks of the productive turn our economies require.A world of untapped possibilities emerges, for example, when we consider energy transformation. Project Drawdown, a nonprofit environmental coalition, estimates that an increase to 21.6 percent in the global production of onshore wind electricity by 2050 would reduce CO2 emissions by 84.6 gigatons and save $7.4 trillion.The time has come to put a price on the type of development that can be expected to generate lasting cohesion and peace. Because that’s what this is all about: humanity’s survival, done right.
5364	 1987	a	Many large nonprofit organizations, such as universities, depend on receiving from donors securities that have appreciated in value; the donors in the past have gotten sizable tax write-offs. But under the new law, the appreciated portion of such gifts will be subject to alternative minimum tax treatment for the first time. The coalition estimated this provision alone will mean $1 billion less for nonprofit organizations.Some wealthy donors have been fulfilling two- and three-year pledges ahead of schedule, according to Brian O'Connell, the coalition's president. Consequently, it will be much tougher to come near the same levels of giving in 1987 and 1988, he acknowledged. However, he also argued that although tax policies influence the size of gifts, donors will continue to give ''for all the right reasons.''Traditionally, the time between Thanksgiving and New Year's is the busiest period for fund-raisers. In recent months, many buttressed their usual appeals by arguing the tax advantages of giving in 1986. Stanley S. Weithorn, a New York lawyer and tax adviser to both nonprofit groups and wealthy donors, also emphasized to clients that the old law applies to any gift mailed before midnight yesterday, even though it may be received by the beneficiary in 1987. 'The Most Generous Month'''Columbia University is expecting December to be the most generous month in its history in terms of private donations,'' Norman S. Fink, deputy vice president for development and alumni relations, said recently. He estimated that $10 million in gifts would be received for December. The University began a five-year drive in 1982 to raise $500 million.Yale University received more than $11 million in December, more than double the amount of money received from individuals during December 1985. Many of the gifts were appreciated securities, and reflected the donors' interest in acting before the Dec. 31 deadline, according to Sue Dorn, associate vice president for development.
4771	 1991	a	"Some countries have only expressed sympathy and effectively taken no step to stop the suppression" of the rebellion, Teheran radio said. "This double standard demonstrates indifference to the plight of Iraqi civilians on the part of countries which have established human rights commissions ostensibly to defend civilians."Asked today whether the commentary was aimed at the United States, Mr. Sarmadi said that it was.Iran, which opposed both Iraq's occupation of Kuwait and the presence of United States forces in the region, is widely believed to have assisted the Shiite Muslim revolt in southern and central Iraq. But its official stance on Iraq's future leadership is that it will not interfere in the country's internal affairs, a position similar to that of the United States.Asked why Washington should be blamed for taking a stance similar to Iran's, Mr. Sarmadi said that there were "fundamental differences" between Iran's relationship with Iraq and America's.First, he said, Iran began establishing better relations with Iraq after its eight-year war."But U.S. forces are, in fact, at war with Iraq," he said. "Part of Iraqi territory is still under American occupation."Moreover, he said, Iran had long been supplying humanitarian relief to the Iraqis; the United States has not. These conditions, coupled with the Bush Administration's call for Iraqis to rise up against their Government, led the Iraqi people to rebel.

6082	 1977	a	Thunderstorms with heavy rain squalls and salvos of lightning danced over the Ne,v York metropolitan area yesterday afternoon, slowing homebound traffic and knocking out electric power briefly in nearly 17.000 homes and busihesses in parts of the city and suburbs.The storms moved into the metropolitan area about 2:30 P.M. and continued into the early evening. The National Weather Service said about a half‐inch of rain fell in New York City. most of in the first hour, and temperatures dropped sharply from the mid‐SO's to the low 70's.There were numerous, scattered problems for public utilities. High winds and pounding rains felled tree limbs that severed overhead power lines in Staten Island and Westchester and Rockland Counties. Lightning strikes were blamed for other power failures, and short circuits on transmission lines were said to have led to other blackouts.Rockland County was the hardest hit. A total of 5,700 customers of the Orange and Rockland Utilities, principally in Haverstraw, Tappan, Mount Ivy, Suffern and Pomona, were left without power for periods ranging up to two hours. Some of the utility's customers in Bergen County in northern New Jersey also were affected.

5064	 1989	a	As for Ms. Rolle, her matriarch is made up largely of posings and sermonizings. ''You were supposed to be my beginning again,'' she rebukes her son. ''You were supposed to be my harvest.'' Who wouldn't go out for a drink?More human are Lena's son, 35-year-old Walter Lee (Danny Glover) and his hard-working wife, Ruth (Starletta DuPois). Walter Lee, the household's solitary man, is at the center of the plot. Frustrated by his feelings of powerlessness, fed up with his job as a chauffeur, desperate to prove himself, he invests most of his father's insurance money with a neighborhood hustler. When Ruth, a part-time domestic worker, who wants mainly her husband's love, learns that she is pregnant (the audience learns it when she faints at the end of a scene, sure evidence of pregnancy in the theater), she is driven to consider an abortion.Ms. DuPois doesn't have much to do except show distress at distressing events, but she manages to seem solid and believable. Mr. Glover does enough emoting for both of them. He carries conviction in his quieter moments, but much of the time he is contorting his big frame and throwing himself around the furniture and on the floor; he rants incessantly and perspires prodigiously. When he hears that his mother is planning to use the insurance payment to buy a house instead of entrusting the money to him, he crunches a glass in his hand, sure evidence of agitation in the theater.Egged on by the emotion-wringing direction of Bill Duke, all the characters keep yelling at one another or weeping with one another about money, independence, family pride and so forth. They seem not to trust the audience to detect a feeling unless it is shouted or bawled. The camera, often stopping the action to hold a reaction and lingering over limp jokes, accentuates the play's weaknesses and strains the patience of even a sympathetic viewer.Mr. Duke sensibly does not try to open things up by taking the characters out of their apartment, but he has been unable to resist shooting periodically through a kitchen window so that Lena's favorite plant, sitting symbolically on the sill in a bit of sun, can occupy the foreground.

3715	 1998	a	EH, what's up, Doc?Jigsaw puzzles -- Looney Tunes Cosmic Capers Animated Jigsaws, a puzzle collection culled from the intergalactic travels of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig and Marvin the Martian. Snap the puzzle pieces together, and the image becomes an animated cartoon from the Warner Brothers vaults. Seeing ''Duck Dodgers in the 24 1/2th Century'' fragmented, reconstituted and animated on a computer monitor, one realizes that a bunch of deranged 40-something cartoon characters are the vanguard of convergence.But then, we already knew that.As with any toy transported from the physical world to the computer screen, there is the question of whether a digital interface adds anything to the experience. In this case, it does. Putting together a jigsaw puzzle, particularly the cardboard variety, is an abstract undertaking. It's about memory and spatial perception and pattern recognition. You sort things by color, find the corners, assemble the edges, put together the obvious clusters, then fill in the gaps. When you snap two pieces together, the primary payoff is the ''aha'' realization that they fit, followed by a tactile sense of completion when you mash them together with your thumb.The virtual version elicits the same puzzle-assembly behavior. (Those sorting strategies are so universal and instinctual, one half-suspects that a jigsaw gene is lurking somewhere in the cipher of human DNA.) The ''aha'' moment is identical. Instead of tactile feedback, there's a sound effect to punctuate the moment when pieces lock together. Essentially, it's the same kind of payoff -- some sensory reassurance that the pieces fit, a validation of your insight. In digital translation, a jigsaw puzzle doesn't lose much.And it gains a lot. For one thing, it's replayable. Unlike the cardboard image, which loses all attraction once it is assembled, the digital image can be recast as a different puzzle (or displayed as computer wallpaper). There are 48 different patterns, from conventional cut-out shapes to square and round configurations, which are surprisingly difficult because they lack the usual interlocking puzzle parts. This game makes you realize how much ''pure logic'' really comes down to habit.

5699	 1985	a	EVERYTHING about Cecilia (Mia Farrow) is tinged with melancholy, including the time - the depressed 1930's - and the place, a drab little New Jersey town where even the sunlight looks gray. Her husband, Monk (Danny Aiello), a big, short-tempered lug, isn't a bad sort, really, and, like almost every other man in town, he's out of a job and not looking for work. However, when he's had a few beers, he's inclined to push her around a bit.Cecilia presents her objections to Monk in the form of extremely tentative observations: ''All you do is drink and play dice and I wind up getting smacked.'' Replies Monk with reason: ''I always warn you first.'' Cecilia is even a failure as a waitress in the town's single, very greasy spoon.It's no wonder that Cecilia, like millions of other Americans of her time, finds life on the silver screen not only preferable to - but more real than - the world around her. One day, after going through a bad patch at the diner and with Monk, she is sitting in the Jewel Theater, watching something called ''The Purple Rose of Cairo'' for the umpteenth time, when the film's handsome, four-square juvenile, a pith-helmeted character named Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels), steps down from the screen and into Cecilia's life. As Cecilia later confides to her sister, ''I just met a wonderful man. He's fictional, but you can't have everything.''This is the real ''Purple Rose of Cairo,'' which is the title of Woody Allen's new comedy, as well as of the movie within it.

And a man from the Lower East Side, burdened with that name, who rejoiced in last year’s election. “I never thought that a black man could become president. Watching him brought tears to my eyes.”John Quincy Adams: Our sixth president did not leave behind much of a popular impression; certainly not on the 87-year-old pastor in Bedford-Stuyvesant who shares the name and believes his own life has been equally fruitful.Ulysses Grant: Our 18th president was a man of great perseverance. Having a name that could easily be rendered “Useless” or “Grunt” by taunting friends also calls for perseverance. And some anger management classes.Calvin Coolidge: Our 30th president and his very distant relation in upstate New York obviously share a passion for rural life, but Calvin Coolidge was famously pictured with a horse, while Calvin Coolidge favors alpacas. In fact, he raises them.John F. Kennedy: Our 35th president was known for the charm he could exert. However, the Long Island accountant said: “I didn’t really have a lot of luck with the girls because of the name. And you’d figure with Irish girls it would be easy.”Richard Nixon: Our 37th president was tormented. The retired Atlantic City firefighter found that the name made him the subject of many jokes over 30 years in the firehouse. But the humor never got too vicious or mean spirited.Ronald Reagan: Ronald Reagan of Syracuse was presumably named after the 40th president, but about a decade before that other Reagan entered the political arena. Mr. Reagan says he doesn’t mind the name. His son, Ronald, feels differently.

918	 2013	a	PhotoThe case of Burch vs. Burch is about to be closed.After a year of legal wrangling between the designer Tory Burch and her former husband, Chris Burch, who is also the owner of the clothing retailer C. Wonder, Ms. Burch announced on Tuesday night that an agreement had been reached to settle all pending legal claims between the couple.PhotoAdditionally, Ms. Burch said that BDT Capital Partners and General Atlantic were making minority investments in the company. Mr. Burch will retain at least some of his stake in the business, which the Burches founded together in 2003 while they were still married.Mr. Burch had filed a lawsuit against Ms. Burch in October, claiming that she and the board members of her company had interfered with his attempts to sell part of his 28 percent stake. Ms. Burch responded with counterclaims that Mr. Burch was at fault because, after their divorce in 2007, he started C. Wonder, a company with similar preppy clothing and store designs to hers. Any interested investors were hesitant to make a deal until the Burches settled their differences.While the spat spilled over into the press, and then the courts (a judge in the case described it as a “drunken WASP fest”), both parties were interested in a settlement to protect their investments in the Tory Burch brand, which has sales of roughly $800 million annually and has been one of the most successful new fashion businesses of the last decade.
1760	 2009	a	The Richard Prince exhibition “Spiritual America,” which was planned to open Thursday at the Tate Modern museum in London, was withdrawn Wednesday, following a warning from Scotland Yard that its inclusion of a nude photograph of Brooke Shields taken when she was 10 years could violate obscenity laws, The Guardian reported. The exhibition was to be shown as part of the gallery’s program Pop Life: Art in a Material World, but was closed off from display after newspaper reviews of the exhibition drew the attention of the Metropolitan police. The photograph, which was included in “Spiritual America” when it was shown at the Guggenheim Museum in 2007, was taken by Mr. Prince from another that photograph was made by Gary Gross in 1976 and authorized by Ms. Shields’s mother. Scotland Yard told The Guardian that the actions of its officers were “common sense.” A spokeswoman for the Tate Modern said that the display had been “temporarily closed down” and that the catalog for the exhibition had been withdrawn from sale.
5732	 1985	a	The International Trade Commission today granted the Tandon Corporation's request for temporary relief against the Sony Corporation, the Mitsubishi Electric Corporation and the Teac Corporation involving the importing of double-sided floppy disk drive products into the United States. Tandon lawyers said that the company expects the commission to order the Japanese companies to post bond for all domestic floppy disk-drive sales while a patent infringement case is pending.Tandon filed the complaint in December. The commission could ultimately exclude Japanese floppy drive products, although analysts said that it was unlikely. A final decision in the case is expected by the end of the year. Tandon's patent applies to both 5 1/4-inch drives, the most popular in the market, and to 3 1/2-inch drives.''This industry is being destroyed so quickly we had to ask for temporary relief,'' said Ranjit Sitlani, Tandon's vice president for corporate development.

3603	 1998	a	IN the age of the indie, the independent-film-making movement, a Yonkers native and film maker, Joe Lovero, has joined the ranks of young writer-directors who use familiar surroundings to convey their stories without the financial resources of major film studios.Mr. Lovero, whose company is called It Came With a Frame Productions, recently began filming ''Puppet, Love and Mertz,'' a comedy short about three creative people who will beg, borrow or steal to support their artistry. The film features Ian Lithgow of NBC's ''Third Rock From the Sun,'' Elisabeth Rohm, who is seen on ABC's ''One Life to Live,'' and Francis Jue of the Broadway play ''M. Butterfly.'' Mr. Lovero is directing and producing the film with JoAnn Gardner, a unit producer for NBC's megahit, ''Seinfeld.''''We received 3,500 head shots and auditioned approximately 600 actors for the full script, which features 47 speaking roles,'' Mr. Lovero said during a location shoot in January at the Royal Regency Hotel in Yonkers. ''And we're certain that our film features some of tomorrow's talent today.''Born, raised and educated in Yonkers, Joe Lovero, whose office is in the TriBeCa Film Center in Manhattan, has derived significant interest in his screenplay from some of the world's leading film studios. Because of this attention he was able to raise the money needed to shoot a 20-minute film adaptation based on what he envisions as the full feature of ''Puppet, Love and Mertz.'' Top technical staff and crew members from the film industry joined him, many as volunteers.

3262	 2000	a	To the Editor:The increasingly fervent claims of one or another of the presidential candidates that they are ''the true believers'' in one religious group or another and the increasingly frenetic claims of all of the presidential candidates to having a personal relationship with God are disturbing, to say the least (Week in Review, Feb. 27).Some candidates are for the political aims of some religious groups, and some are against leaders of religious groups. Some are for ''life'' and some are for ''choice.'' I recommend they all show me through their actions that they have religious beliefs that show their commitment to provide for the common welfare of all peoples.TOM E.

4967	 1990	a	''I sat down one day and said, 'This is what I'm going to do,' and people are paying attention,'' she said. ''We all get annoyed, but we really didn't know that others were equally furious. This seems to have struck a major chord. Even those of us who are most privileged are deprived of positive images of ourselves and of opportunities to learn. For black people, it's suicidal not to have these images, and for nonblacks it presents distortion. It makes them expect a world that doesn't exist.''She said a view of a multicultural world is essential. ''In Fairfield County,'' she said, ''a lot of people have presumed that we don't need this. But we do.''Ms. Adams said that over the years she has heard ''every negative that people can think of - blacks don't read, blacks don't buy books'' - as excuses for libraries and bookstores not to carry books about blacks or by lesser-known black authors. Black authors ''have to be extraordinary'' she said, for their work to be widely sold and distributed. She added that black literature tends to get fewer reviews, less advertising and less opportunity to reach the shelves of libraries and bookstores.Ms. Adams, who is 43 years old, has worked as a playwright, as a writer for television and radio, and as host of an arts program on National Public Radio. Since 1985, she has run her own publishing company, Back Pax, which produces multicultural books and tapes for children. She started the book club with her own funds and those of three black entrepreneurs. After two years of research and development, the club was tested last summer at Black Family Reunion festivals held by the National Council of Negro Women in Atlanta, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Cincinnati and Washington.''By the fifth test - in Washington - we began offering memberships. We were there for nine hours over two afternoons, and one person joined for every minute and a half that we were on the field,'' said Ms. Adams, who called the response overwhelming.

5188	 1989	a	The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission approved an 11.5 percent rise in yellow-cab fares yesterday, the first in a series of expected fare increases on public transportation systems in the New York metropolitan area.The taxi fare increase, the second in less than three years, goes into effect at 12:01 A.M. on Jan. 7, six days after the state's Metropolitan Transportation Authority is expected to impose its own fare increase of at least 15 percent for buses, subways and commuter rail lines.The city's $1 billion-a-year yellow-cab industry, which carries 500,000 people a day, is the third largest mode of transportation in the region, after the New York City buses and subways, which carry more than 5 million people a day.The M.T.A. board is to vote on a proposal to raise the transit fares on Dec. 15.

1854	 2008	a	An internal review by the inspector general of the federal Department of Justice is sharply critical of how the department has administered federal death benefits for police and firefighters. The review focuses on the work of the department’s Bureau of Justice Assistance, the agency that has denied claims by the families of two auxiliary police officers who were killed a year ago by a gunman in Greenwich Village, provoking protests from city and federal officials.It was not immediately clear what influence the review would have on the cases of the New York auxiliary officers, Nicolas T. Pekearo and Yevgeniy Marshalik, who were killed on March 14, 2004.Senator Charles E. Schumer, one of several officials to speak on behalf of the officers’ families, said the review confirmed a “sad reality,” that “time and again, lawyers for the Justice Department have tied themselves in a knot to avoid giving families the benefits owed to them.”The review focused mainly on the administration of death benefits to law enforcement officers who die of heart attacks or strokes in the line of duty, which were authorized by Congress in the 2003 Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits Act. That act amended an earlier law, the Public Safety Officers Benefits Act, that was intended to provide benefits to those who are killed battling fires, by criminal gun fire or other unnatural causes.The department took 33 months to develop guidelines for new claims after the 2003 amendments were enacted, the review said, and amassed a large backlog of unprocessed claims. By last August, an analysis by The Times found that it had processed 52 claims, approving only 42, and was processing about 200 more.In a report on its internal review, the Justice Department said today that claims processing had been hastened somewhat, and the criterion for approval had loosened. As of Nov. 29, it said, 112 claims had been processed, and 47 approved.Nonetheless, a report on the review concludes that the department should “establish more definitive performance guidelines.”In denying the claims of the families of Officers Pekearo and Marshalik, which would be about $300,000 each, the Justice Department said the auxiliary officers did not qualify because they did not have arrest powers. Both families have appealed, and appeared last week at a hearing before a Department of Justice in Manhattan. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly also spoke on their behalf.The department said the appeal remains under consideration.
4639	 1992	a	For much of its 67-year history, The New Yorker has seemed to float in splendid isolation, a law unto itself, unruffled by the turbulence that disturbs lesser magazines.The last decade has changed all that.The announcement that Tina Brown, the editor in chief of Vanity Fair, will replace Robert A. Gottlieb as editor of The New Yorker means the magazine will have its second new editor in five years. The changes in editorship represent a dramatic increase in the metabolic rate of a magazine whose first two editors, Harold W. Ross and William Shawn, presided for more than half a century.Mr. Shawn, a managing editor who took over the top spot when Mr. Ross died in 1951, after in effect having run the show for two years, edited the magazine for so long that an entire generation of readers grew up with no memory of the Ross New Yorker, a quite different magazine than the one Mr. Gottlieb inherited from Mr. Shawn. From Bite to WhimsyIn its original form, The New Yorker was a brilliant, unpredictable product of the Jazz Age, irreverent, brisk, gossipy and sharp. The provocative tone was set by contributors like Dorothy Parker, Wolcott Gibbs, Robert Benchley and James Thurber, and later by S. J. Perelman and A. J. Liebling.

3050	 2001	a	The questions hung heavily in the air and then seemed to fill the room.Daniel R. Coats, the former Republican senator from Indiana, had been summoned to a suite at the Madison Hotel near the White House by President-elect George W. Bush and Vice President-elect Dick Cheney for an audition of sorts for the job of secretary of defense, advisers to the participants recalled.And in the midst of their 45-minute conversation, on Dec. 18, the two auditioners began to ask themselves whether Mr. Coats was up to the job of running the world's largest corporation, or whether there was a stature gap.Could a former lawmaker who had been a top aide to Dan Quayle when he was a congressman go mano a mano with Colin L. Powell, a four-star general who had served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had run the war that ousted Iraq from Kuwait, had flirted with running for president and was now poised to become secretary of state?Or would he turn out to be Aspin redux, a figure like the Clinton administration's first defense secretary, Representative Les Aspin, who was well liked and respected as a brilliant mind on defense matters but who was widely viewed by White House and Pentagon officials at the end of his tenure as an indecisive and ineffective manager who lost President Clinton's confidence and had to resign?

2236	 2006	a	New York State’s Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, apologized this afternoon for making an off-hand comment that Senator Charles E. Schumer “will put a bullet between the President’s eyes, if he could get away with it.” He called the comments “incredibly stupid and moronic’’ and insisted that he is “not a person of violence.’’“Nobody feels worse about this than I do,’’ Mr. Hevesi, a Democrat, said during a hastily arranged news conference in midtown Manhattan. “I have made thousands of speeches. And I have never done anything like that.’’Mr. Hevesi made the provocative comments earlier in the day during a commencement ceremony at Queens College, where he took a moment to praise Senator Schumer, who was also speaking there, for the senator’s willingness to challenge the policies of the Republican president.— Raymond Hernandez and Conrad Mulcahy
6126	 1977	a	More Than LandAnd land was not the half of it. There were the shipping interests, which perhaps accounted for the newspaper's enthusiasm for the San•Pedro harbor and an annexation of Hawaii: the automotive interests (Goodyear Tire and Rubber) and road construction interests (Western Construction) and gravel and rock interests (Southern California Rock and Gravel, Consolidated Rock Products) and oil interests (Royal Dutch Shell. Union Oil), which perhaps accounted for its disdain of mass transportation systems. The Times also helped to turn Southern California into one gigantic traffic circle from which there seems to be no egress, under the thumb of smog.Not to mention the Santa Anita racetrack the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the chief of police and the Republican Party.No wonder organized crime never had much of a chance in Los Angeles. The Chandlers and their various syndicates ran everything except the vice racket. No wonder a nonentity like Norris Poulson could be elected Mayor three times. Times political columnists decided who was electable. No wonder the Watts. riots came as such a surprise. The Times hadn't reported on the existence of Watts.Aficionados of modern journalism will be most interested in the last third of “Thinking Big,” which is the story of how The Times changed itself after 1960 from a right‐wing parochial rag into one of the nation's finest newspapers, from a sponsor of Norris Poulson to a sponsor of Tom Bradley. is also the fascinating story of the politics of culture, of the reign of Dorothy (Buffy) Chandler over the institutions of spiritual uplift. And it usefully describes the new power elite of Los Angeles, in which there are actually some Democrats and Jews.But I found myself absorbed in the early years. Every dynasty is started by some sort of bandit. General Otis certainly wrote like a bandit: “The apostles of disorder, the missionaries of unrest, the jawsmitbs of closed‐sho•p unionism, the haters of honest industry, the acquisitionists of other people's property, the enviers of other people's prosperity, the brawlers, the larcenists, the dynamiters, the I.W.W.'s and the friends of raising the devil generally are flocking to the standards of Absalom. The air is incarnadined and made mephitic with their presence.”

5620	 1986	a	It has been more than a year now since the overdraft scandal hit E. F. Hutton & Company. And for almost a year, the giant New York brokerage firm has been seeking to get out from under a particularly omnious legal cloud.Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, any company that manages mutual funds is automatically disqualified from the business if it is convicted of a felony. The only exception is if the Securities and Exchange Commission grants the company an exemption. And the S.E.C. can only grant one if the prohibition is ''unduly or disproportionately severe,'' or the applicant's conduct has been such that it is ''not against the public interest to do so.''In May 1985, Hutton, which manages more than $7 billion in mutual funds, pleaded guilty to 2,000 felony counts of mail and wire fraud. That set off the automatic disqualification as a fund manager. But a appeal to the S.E.C. got Hutton a temporary exemption. And on Thursday, it will come before the S.E.C. again to seek a permanent exemption.Although commission officials expect the firm to get the exemption, the S.E.C. will consider imposing certain conditions on future conduct, requiring that any Hutton fund have a majority of independent directors or trustees, that Hutton must retain independent counsel for the disinterested directors or trustees and that Hutton have an audit committee made up of disinterested directors or trustees.

2725	 2003	a	Mr. O'Keefe said that those remarks should be taken in context and that they did not address some extraordinary efforts NASA could have mounted in an emergency, as in the Apollo 13 accident in 1970.When an oxygen tank exploded while Apollo 13 en route to the moon, the three astronauts aboard had no certain way to return home and hardly enough breathable air. But engineers cobbled together a plan to use the lunar landing vehicle as a lifeboat, cleanse the air and bring the astronauts home safely.''Apollo 13 was not in anyone's scenario or contingency plans,'' Mr. O'Keefe said. Had anyone known that the Columbia was in trouble, he said, the agency would have used all its resources to find a solution. ''We would have poured everything we had into it,'' he said.At a news conference shortly after the Columbia disaster, Mr. Dittemore said there would have been no way to minimize the severe heat of re-entry to protect the shuttle in the event of severely damaged tiles and thus little hope of bringing the craft down safely. Other officials also said that the shuttle did not have enough fuel to make it to the International Space Station for refuge and that there was no time for a safe launch of another shuttle to rescue the crew.Mr. O'Keefe acknowledged that he knew of no formal contingency plan that would have covered the case of the Columbia, in which a space shuttle in orbit was suspected of having an unknown degree of damage to its thermal protection tiles. But he and William F. Readdy, NASA's associate administrator for space flight, said that much of the agency's training dealt with handling unexpected events and emergencies.

2748	 2003	a	It has been more than a decade since Leslie King and 11 other jurors in Brooklyn acquitted Lemrick Nelson Jr. of murder and manslaughter charges in the fatal stabbing of Yankel Rosenbaum. But Ms. King said yesterday that she was not surprised to hear that lawyers for Mr. Nelson, who is being tried for the third time in connection with the attack on Mr. Rosenbaum in Crown Heights in 1991, are now changing course and saying that he did, in fact, participate.''We weren't saying he had nothing to do with it,'' she said of Mr. Nelson, whose lawyers during the two earlier trials said just that. ''We just couldn't match the charges to the evidence we were given.''Ms. King, 35, said she and her fellow jurors knew Mr. Nelson, then 16, was nearby when Mr. Rosenbaum was attacked by an angry crowd and stabbed to death on Aug. 19, 1991, a few hours after a Hasidic Jew ran over and killed a 7-year-old black child.The jurors also knew there was ''a good chance'' Mr. Nelson was directly involved in the stabbing, Ms. King said.

5014	 1990	a	The owner of the New England Patriots' football team yesterday promised ''mammoth changes'' for the team's management structure while angrily complaining he had not been informed by Patriot officials for several days about an incident in which Lisa Olson, a sports reporter for The Boston Herald, alleged she was subjected to sexual harassment by several naked players in the New England locker room on Sept. 17.Victor Kiam, appearing on National Football League pregame programs on NBC and CBS, said: ''The fact that no action was taken from Monday until Thursday is a disgrace and the fact that I was not even told by my own people is worse than that.''Asked about the future status of Patrick Sullivan, the New England general manager, Kiam said, ''I think there will be changes in the ultimate responsibility at the Patriots.'' But, shortly afterward, he was told by Paul Tagliabue, the N.F.L. commissioner, that he could not make any personnel changes or suspend anyone until the league office completes its investigation.According to Olson, who with Bob Sales, the Herald's executive sports editor, met with Kiam for 1 hour 15 minutes yesterday morning at a Logan Airport hotel, the owner is also angry with Jim Oldham, the Patriots' director of media relations, for not keeping him informed of the controversy.

And will it be worse next time?A new study may lay some of the fears to rest, at least for many parents.Writing in the current Annals of Neurology, researchers offer evidence that if the first seizure is short, in all probability any subsequent ones will be, too.The issue is important because while many children experience no harm from a seizure, scary as it can be, longer seizures can be damaging.Moreover, while most seizures stop on their own, longer ones can require medical intervention.The lead author of the study, Dr. Shlomo Shinnar, a neurologist at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx and a professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said the findings might prove useful for parents trying to decide whether medicine is needed right after they learn the child has epilepsy. Many prefer to avoid that route, concerned about side effects.

2762	 2003	a	Bria Harris, 9, a third grader at the John A. Reisenbach Charter School, pinned her hopes on another chance to take in the rides at an amusement park and to romp again through a spacious playground. Medinah Powell, 8, a third grader at Community School 200, wanted another go at outrunning the children she had met in Connecticut.Noah Howard, 7, a first grader at P.S. 30, spoke of his first swimming lessons and belly-dives into a pool, and of a parting-night campfire with his host family that had included eating chocolate and marshmallow treats known as s'mores and concluded by chasing -- and catching -- lightning bugs. He had never seen fireflies. When the children were later asked to draw pictures of their vacations, Noah drew himself in a field full of fireflies, reaching to snatch one.The Fresh Air Fund sponsors summer vacations for more than 10,000 city children each year. More than half spend two weeks with host families along the East Coast and in Canada. Others head to campgrounds operated by the fund.Children can register for Fresh Air Fund vacations through July, but community groups can end the process earlier. The Abyssinian Development Corporation will stop its registration by the end of this month. Until then, children can register on Tuesday nights from 5 to 7. Mrs. Gibson helps parents with the medical, school and other forms that make up the registration package. She also works to match children with families.Opportunities provided to children through the Fresh Air Fund are important, said Kima Reed, vice president of programs for Abyssinian. ''They've had a summer experience, which can make all the difference,'' she said. ''And it helps families, too -- families who might not have had the chance to have the Disney experience.''Kyliek, a first grader at P.S. 123, spoke fondly of taking in a baseball game last summer and being allowed onto the field to run the bases after play had finished. He also enjoyed a trip to an amusement park and ballgames with the Behans and the neighborhood children. ''I played with them every day that there was,'' he said.He, too, drew pictures of his activities upstate: running around the infield and playing with a football, a soccer ball, a basketball and ''just a regular ball.'' He signed his name to each of his pictures except one -- a stick drawing of himself. That picture he inscribed: ''I like everything. Everyone in the world.''Families that would like to become hosts or those who wish to register children for a Fresh Air Fund summer vacation can call (800) 367-0003. Tax-deductible contributions can be made to the Fresh Air Fund, 633 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017. They can also be made through the fund's Web site, www.freshair.org.

4890	 1990	a	The Indian Government has withdrawn permission for the filming of the book ''The City of Joy'' on the ground that it would show Calcutta in too negative a light.It is also barring a European team from making a documentary on Mother Teresa. Film crews require the permission of the federal Government to work in India.''The City of Joy,'' a $16 million film of Dominique Lapierre's nonfiction story of a Roman Catholic priest working in one of the world's worst slums, was to be directed by Roland Joffe, who also made ''The Killing Fields'' and ''The Mission.'' More than half of the film budget would have been spent in the city.The unexpected decision by a new Government that came to power less than a month ago pledging freedom of expression and a more open society was announced recently in Calcutta by the Minister of Information and Broadcasting, Parvathaneni Upendra.

She leaves Bert, her adoring husband of 53 years; sons John and Bill, daughter Wendy; sister Sarah; brother Larry and four grandchildren. She was an avid watercolorist, opera lover, tennis player, sailor, and gardener. But she will perhaps be best remembered as the "hostess-with-the-mostess," graciously entertaining friends and family from far and wide. Always positive, exceedingly generous, ever active, a loving mother and devoted wife, she will be missed by many and forgotten by few.

1108	 2012	a	In the last 24 hours, thousands of women turned to Twitter and Facebook to express their anger over the decision by the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation, the world’s largest breast cancer organization, to halt financial support for cancer screening and education services at Planned Parenthood affiliates.Planned Parenthood, as my colleague Pam Belluck reported, accused Komen of bowing to pressure from anti-abortion rights activists, prompting a passionate online discussion from both sides of the abortion debate, as well as thousands of online messages lamenting the role of politics in women’s health care.Beyond politicians and advocates, some authors, including Judy Blume and celebrities, including actress Dana Delaney jumped into the conversation on Twitter.On Wednesday, Susan G. Komen was a top Google search term, falling just below Don Cornelius, the creator of “Soul Train,” after news of his death was announced. It was also a top trending topic in the U.S. on Twitter. And more than 5,000 people left comments on a post that Komen made on its Facebook page defending its decision, which the foundation said was not made in response to pressure from opponents of abortion rights.On the Red State blog, Erik Erikson applauded Komen’s decision and urged people to send a thank you note and a donation to the organization.Groups, including Americans United for Life, also urged people to show their support for the Komen Foundation on Facebook.While there were comments on Facebook, Twitter and online message boards praising Komen, an analysis by Polipulse, a social media analytics tool for a Washington-based public relations firm showed that 75 percent of the people posting on social media channels about the decision were sharing negative comments about Komen’s decison while 25 percent supported it. According to the analysis, more than 20 percent said that they would not give money to Komen because of the move.Some people called on their Facebook friends and Twitter followers to turn in their pink ribbons and offer financial support to Planned Parenthood instead of Susan G. Komen. An online letter was shared by more than 19,000 people. By Wednesday afternoon, Planned Parenthood was advertising on Twitter using promoted tweets to help raise money.Please RT: Help us make sure that women continue to get the care they need. Donate to Planned Parenthood today: bit.ly/AAlipY #komen — Planned Parenthood (@PPact) February 1, 2012Raising money online, alone, generated $400,000 by Wednesday evening, in addition to a $250,000 donation from a Dallas-based organization.In an article by Gardiner Harris and Pam Belluck about the Komen foundation, a board member said that Planned Parenthood exploiting the news as a fund-raising opportunity.Some of the online discussion centered on Karen Handel, the Komen foundation’s senior vice president for public policy since April 2011, who ran on an anti-abortion rights platform during an unsuccessful bid for governor of Georgia in 2010. The blog, Jezebel, found a post on Ms. Handel’s campaign blog stating that she did not support the mission of Planned Parenthood.And both organizations used social media throughout the day to communicate their position, including a Komen organization in Connecticut that announced on its Facebook page its frustration with the decision to cut funds for Planned Parenthood.

6248	 1973	a	The city's 5,000 unarmed auxiliary policemen — withdrawn from street patrols last Monday after attacks on regular uniformed policemen left one man dead and eight wounded — will resume their patrols tomorrow might, but in civilian clothes.Police Commissioner Patrick V. Murphy said at a news conference yesterday that before going out on patrol again, to serve as the “eyes and ears of the Police Department,” the auxiliaries were getting two nights of instruction on how to patrol in civilian clothes. The auxiliary's uniform is the same as a regular patrolman's except for the shoulder patch.“We're stressing safety and rapid communications at the special training sessions tonight and tomorrow night,” the Police Commissioner said.He also reported that back‐up patrols for the regular force would continue. The back‐up patrols were begun after a patrol car was ambushed last Thursday. Two patrolmen were injured by automatic‐weapons fire in that attack, and two more in a second attack on Sunday. Policemen have been volunteering to work overtime —including on their days off —for the back‐up patrols.

6164	 1976	a	ORADELL, March 2—A 10‐year struggle by Bergen Catholic High School to gain membership in the Northern New Jersey Interscholastic League—a struggle involving civil rights, the energy crisis and rising school taxes—may be near climax.Now composed of nine public schools‐six in Bergen County and three in Passaic Countythe athletic league has one opening, because Garfield dropped out. Eight schoolsBergen Catholic, Don Bosco of Ramsey, Passaic, Nutley, Belleville, Montclair, North Bergen and Bloomfield‐have applied for the vacancy, but none with the determination of Bergen Catholic of Oradell, which is run by the Christian Brothers of Ireland.Aaron Halpern, princlpal of Clifton High School and president of the league, has called a meeting for his conference room tomorrow to hear a re port from the evaluators who have surveyed the eight applications. “We are not sure that we will take a vote, but we could,” Mr. Halpern said.Originally, when Bergen Catholic applied for membership in 1985, the school was informed that participation in the league was limited by the group's constitution to public schools. Undeterred, the school persisted in submitting applications, and finally in 1974 sought relief from the State Division of Civil Rights, accusing the league of discrimination.

88	 2019	a	‘I Love You, Now Die: The Commonwealth v. Michelle Carter’Parts 1 and 2 start streaming: July 9 and 10Is it a crime to urge someone to commit suicide? Michelle Carter was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2017 for encouraging her boyfriend Conrad Roy to kill himself, via text and phone calls. The documentary from Erin Lee Carr (whose father was David Carr, a New York Times columnist who died in 2015) explores the troubling context of this Massachusetts case, and the legal precedents it set. The film is divided into two parts, one dealing with the prosecution’s case, the other that of the defense.‘Share’Starts streaming: July 27In the writer-director Pippa Bianco’s award-winning feature debut, high school student Mandy (Rhianne Barreto) wakes up on her parents’ front lawn, wondering how she got there and what happened to her the night before. She soon finds out — her classmates are circulating a video in which she appears to be unconscious, lying on a floor with a laughing crowd gathered around and a boy pulling down her underwear. We enter into Mandy’s head space via hazy images, impressionistic flashes and extreme close-ups as she tries to figure out what happened, how she feels and what she wants to do about it.‘Unmasking Jihadi John: Anatomy of a Terrorist’Starts streaming: July 31Why would a mild-mannered Brit become a terrorist? That may be impossible to fully know, but this documentary, directed by Anthony Wonke, attempts to arrive at an answer. Through interviews with his former teachers, hostages and U.S. and British intelligence operatives, a portrait is drawn of Mohammed Emwazi, the masked executioner behind a series of ISIS videos of hostage beheadings.

449	 2016	a	PhotoMONDAY PUZZLE — Paula Gamache is back, and she seems to be telling us something in her theme.You’ll find that something in the revealer at 41A (ME TOO), which explains why there are two MEs in each of Ms. Gamache’s theme entries, like 18A’s PRIME TIME.Beginning solvers, there are three more theme entries like that for you to find, and some of you might be having a hard time finding those entries. Here are a couple of general hints on how to locate theme entries in a Monday puzzle:– Sometimes, although not today, the theme entries might end with a question mark.– Theme entries are usually, but not always, the longer entries in an early week puzzle.Photo– If you know about diagonal symmetry in crossword grids, the theme entries will usually lie opposite each other. In the grid to the right (not today’s puzzle), for example, one theme entry can be found at 17A (shaded in blue) and another can be found at its symmetrical opposite at 58A (shaded in green). The other two theme entries for that day are at the symmetrical entries 24- and 51A.And, if you need another hint, sometimes there’s what we call a revealer, which ties up the theme nicely. In Ms. Gamache’s puzzle, the central entry ME TOO, takes a familiar phrase and reinterprets it to help you understand the theme.Just in case you need something uplifting to start your week, here’s a compilation of (in my opinion) the best “Greeting to a returning soldier, maybe.”Your thoughts?

5256	 1988	a	After years of battling for equal recognition, graduates of foreign medical schools may soon be able to take the same test in basic and clinical sciences that is given to graduates of American medical schools.The National Board of Medical Examiners developed and administers the tests to students of medical schools in the United States to certify them before licensing by the states. It decided last month to consider offering the major parts of its examination to graduates of foreign medical schools.Dr. Robert Volle, president of the board, said that with the change, about 20,000 more people would take the national board's examination each year.The graduates of foreign medical schools, many of them Americans, now take a separate examination, administered by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates, the foreign graduates' equivalent of the national board. The educational commission supported the national board's decision when it met later last month. Both organizations are in Philadlephia. Joint Panel to Make Decision The national board had said the separate tests were needed because the board did not have enough information on the curriculums of medical schools in foreign countries. The two groups will form a joint committee to decide whether to abolish the separate examination for foreign graduates and to arrange to give the national board exam on the same days to the 20,000 more candidates around the world. The change could come as early as next year, Dr. Volle said.

We realized we should have been in a 4x4 when 22 kilometers of road that was meant to be a national highway just disappeared without warning. There is a spectacular train from Goa that we should have taken. When we finally got there, we were shown around this enormous rocky site with hundreds of temples. Its one of the most important Hindu pilgrimage sites in India. You got a real sense that it was once a cultural epicenter for that part of India. On another level, youre just blown away by the scenery and the integration of the archaeology with the geology. It was an epic journey. As told to Austin ConsidineCaleb Kenna for The New York Yimes

4433	 1993	a	Art Bauman, a dancer and choreographer who helped to found the Dance Theater Workshop, died on Wednesday at Tisch Hospital in Manhattan. He was 53 and lived in Manhattan.He died of AIDS, said William Singer, his companion.Mr. Bauman created many of his early dances for Dance Theater Workshop, an informal loft theater when he founded it in 1965 with Jeff Duncan and Jack Moore, both of whom have since died. The organization, which he helped to direct until 1975, later became one of the city's major dance institutions.Mr. Bauman began choreographing in 1962 and became known for painstakingly planned mixed-media collagist dances that were often designed to be performed in specific theater spaces. In addition to the workshop, Mr. Bauman created pieces for Clark Center for the Performing Arts, the Columbia Arts Festival, Dance Uptown and the Cubiculo. His work was also presented at The Place in London and the New York Dance Festival in Central Park.His best-known dance was "Dialog," a solo in which the choreographer, live and on film, portrayed a businessman racing against time and corporate pressures. Writing in The New York Times, Anna Kisselgoff described the 1965 work as enduring and "a very polished piece."

1841	 2008	a	Later this week, a who’s who of the mergers and acquisitions world will troop down to New Orleans, where Tulane University Law School will be holding its Corporate Law Institute. The event, which formally starts Thursday, will mark the 20th anniversary of an annual gathering that regularly draws the nation’s most prominent deal lawyers.Flipping through the brochure, one is struck by just how much things have changed in the few short months since it was first distributed. But the events of the last year still loom large. Below, 10 of the burning issues that I hope will be discussed later this week.1. Is it time to retire the Williams Act? The Williams Act is 40 years old this year, and many of its provisions governing tender offers are outdated, set up for a time before the poison pill, when companies lacked takeover defenses. For example, given the existence of a poison pill and a target’s ability to cap a bidder’s acquisitions of shares, is it even necessary to retain the all-holders/best price rule?2. Conversely, when will the Securities and Exchange Commission get back in the takeover regulation business? The S.E.C. has been a relatively quiescent regulator of takeovers since its heyday in the 1980s, apparently content to let Delaware be the king. The last real, substantive S.E.C. review of merger regulation was back in 1983. (Marty Lipton was on that panel also.) This has left us with a federal takeover code that is outdated — see point 1 — and sometimes makes little sense. For example, is there any reason to not put mergers and tender offers on full parity? And why is it that the Delaware courts now appear to be the primary regulators of fairness opinion disclosure? It would be nice if the S.E.C. could at least fix these issues and harmonize its regulation with the last twenty years of Delaware’s decisions.3. Are special-purpose acquisition companies a boon — or the next calamity waiting to happen? In particular — and since this is a takeover conference — I’m interested in the issues that are likely to arise in the coming wave of SPAC takeovers. Will significant SPAC shareholders attempt to hold up acquisitions and extort additional consideration by their ability to vote no on acquisitions and force a liquidation of the vehicle? What happens when the trading price of a SPAC is actually below the liquidation value in such circumstances? And who is still buying these things anyway?4.What is the likely future structure of private equity transactions? Are we going to see a continued, wholesale shift to single-tier reverse termination fee deals with no possibility of specific performance? This appears to be the trend right now, but what will happen once the market perks up again and strategic bidders compete for deals? In this regard, it would be nice to get some comment from the Delaware judges on what they think about the availability of specific performance in a cash deal under Delaware law in the face of party language to that effect.5. When will the S.E.C. finally reform its cross-border rules? Eight years after their promulgation, the S.E.C. exemptions for cross-border transactions are still unworkable.6. What should we do about sovereign wealth funds? This was the hot-button issue three issues back, before Bear Stearns; the Clear Channel litigation and its implications for bank-sponsor lending relationships; and the possible restructuring of the financial regulatory framework. But the question remains: Is more regulation of sovereign wealth funds a necessity or an economic burden? And does Treasury’s recent one-page voluntary statement of principles with Dubai and Singapore on these funds mean anything at all? The background issue here is whether the national security review process is currently effective and not overburdensome in light of, inter alia, CFIUS’s blocking of the 3Com transaction. Or perhaps it is not strict enough and should apply to noncontrolling transactions, such as the recent slew of investment bank sovereign wealth investments.7. Are hedge funds the future of mergers? As hedge funds become increasingly activist investors, how will they affect the structuring and completion of takeovers? Are the cries of short-termism correct — or even relevant?8. Do we need to rethink the terms of debt financing arrangements? Given the blow-up in the Clear Channel litigation, should sponsors and other borrowers firm up terms in financing commitment letters and fill the uncertainty over what the “customary” language requirement means? Is Clear Channel an abnormality or is there indeed a need for a rethink of financing language? And how about that solvency language which bit Genesco so hard?9. Is the Bear Stearns deal valid under Delaware law? Will it spell the end of the holding in Omnicare? Her,e I include that uncapped top-up option that went by the wayside in the renegotiated deal. And where is Joe Lewis these days, anyway?10. Who do you love more: the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the S.E.C.? In other words, discuss the Paulson proposal and its chances for success.I’ll also be there at Tulane. I’m hoping to find answers to these and other takeover questions. If you do happen to be attending, feel free to say hi. I’ll be the guy selling do-it-yourself SPAC kits. –Steven M. Davidoff
5255	 1988	a	Growing numbers of Vietnamese have been arriving in Hong Kong by boat in the past few months, crowding into refugee camps with thousands of other Vietnamese, most of whom have only a slim chance of finding new homes outside the chain-link fences of the bleak compounds.So far this year, more than 1,500 Vietnamese refugees, most of them poor farmers and fishermen from north Vietnam, have landed in Hong Kong, four times the number of arrivals during the same period last year, according to Govennment figures.Waves of refugees have been arriving in Thailand and Malaysia as well, and the Thai authorities have pushed some boats back out to sea.Hong Kong has so far resisted such an extreme measure, but a recent newspaper survey revealed that 65 percent of those polled here want any new refugee boats turned away. And the Governor of this British colony, Sir David Wilson, said last week that Hong Kong is reconsidering its policy of allowing all boat people to land. 'Compassion Fatigue'
5811	 1985	a	As a Japanese, I am deeply skeptical of the current movement in Japan, led by Prime Minister Nakasone, to ''totally reevaluate'' postwar institutions, especially education (''How Japan Teaches Its Own History,'' by James Reston Jr., Oct. 27). At best, it can be characterized as extraordinarily naive.At worst, it is a disingenuous attempt to smother an uncomfortable past and to throw away hard-learned historical lessons.As Mr. Reston says, the Japanese are still very reluctant to implicate the Emperor - or any other living person - for the events that led up to the Pacific war, and this, I believe, is the main factor inhibiting scholars from doing serious research into the pre-World War II era. Such a reluctance to make a villain out of a living person is deeply rooted in our culture and, although from a Western point of view it may seem cowardly or even hypocritical, it cannot be altogether rejected. However, it does mean that we are culturally and psychologically still far from being able to claim that the ''postwar era'' is over, as Mr. Nakasone tries to do. MISTUHIRO KAWASE Princeton, N.J.

562	 2015	a	PhotoSATURDAY PUZZLE — Have you ever traveled to a new town with no real plan for exploring and just meandered along the streets, taking in the sights as you go? I love doing that, because it’s the best way to stumble upon the hidden jewels that a town has to offer. That’s precisely how solving Sam Ezersky’s fine puzzle felt to me. I wandered around his grid, laughing and learning as I went, and that is the best possible outcome one can hope for on a Saturday.We are a MOZZARELLA STICK-intensive household, so that’s where I got my toehold, and I counted myself lucky to gain entry into the puzzle at such an auspicious, central position. I crossed that almost immediately with TONY DANZA (how many boxers-turned-sitcom stars could there be?) and was off on my crossword adventure.There was quite a bit of new stuff here, and even the entries that are not new felt fresh, or at least crunchy to me. I liked all the chatter in Mr. Ezersky’s grid: HOLD ON A SEC, AIN’T I, NO DOUBT, OH I FORGOT and NERTS. I liked having to look up HUPMOBILE so that I could bring this interesting line of cars (back) to your attention. I appreciated the beginnings of a cocktail at 36 Down (SKYY VODKA) and the BRAIN GAME at 1 Down. For those of me who have trouble staying awake for “Saturday Night Live,” here’s a short article on the recurring sketch “Les Jeunes de Paris.”Let’s take a stroll through the clues, shall we? For dark humor, I liked “Notice after the expiration date?” for OBIT, and the Misdirection Award goes to “One doing 40+?” for FULL-TIMER. I could have lived without the abbreviated clue/entry pairing of “Size up?:Abbr.”/ENL., and I had a tough time getting from the vague “No wuss” to RAMBO at 12 Down, but there are always a few streets in our wanderings that we realize in hindsight it was better to avoid.Let’s hear from Mr. Ezersky:Constructor’s Notes:From a constructor’s standpoint, it’s always interesting to look at a puzzle that you haven’t touched in seemingly forever. The one published today was constructed over two years ago, when I was in my novice stages of puzzlemaking … and as happy as I am with its acceptance and publication, I can see parts of the fill that I know I would have reworked, had I constructed this puzzle more recently. For instance, the top-right doesn’t feel like my normal work, with ELUL / VALS / ENL right next to each other, and nothing in the stack of 9s really sparkling. But hey, Will accepted this, so I must have done something right! The more fascinating part about looking at this puzzle now is noticing the development of clues over time. When I sent this puzzle in, I had SKYY VODKA clued as [Liquor with the slogan “Passion for perfection”]. Well, not only did another constructor debut this entry before me in a 2012 New York Times puzzle (grr!), but the slogan in the clue was updated to “West of Expected,” which I assume happened because the original one became outdated. Hence, as time flies, clue tweaks become necessary! Enough with my lamenting and scrutiny. What did I like about this puzzle? Well, I like MOZZARELLA STICK, my seed entry. I like BRAIN GAME (for which Will made a nice clue). And I like the way this puzzle “talks” to the solver, with “OH, I FORGOT” and “SAYS ME” and “HOLD ON A SEC.” Coming up with LIVE RADAR while constructing helped me out of a real bind in the bottom-right. Pleased with all the clue saves Will made for crosswordese-y bits. Most of all, I’m just grateful to be constructing for the Times, and I can promise many more puzzle in the future! Thank you all, and enjoy! P.S.: If you’re interested in solving more of my work, feel free to check out my “indie” blog, The Grid Kid. New puzzle every Monday with some zippy stuff! [If you would like to check out some other terrific indie puzzle blogs, I’ve listed as many as I could think of in the Blogroll to the right. — D.A.]And look where we’ve ended up at the end of our stroll: The SAVOY Ballroom, in New York City’s Harlem. Let’s swing on over to the Variety puzzle with this clip about the role The Savoy played in integration through music and dance.Your thoughts?

4913	 1990	a	On this they agreed: after decades of devoted, even life-saving work, Covenant House is suffering an unjust damage to its reputation. But in the wake of the Rev. Bruce Ritter's decision to leave the organization he founded, staff members and residents were divided on other questions.Should he have resigned? Has Covenant House's work begun to suffer? Could the organization bounce back from the accusations of financial and sexual wrongdoing surrounding him? It depended on whom you asked. ''Bruce should have resigned,'' said Lester Pineda, a resident, as he took a break from working out with the punching bags in the Convenant House gym at Ninth Avenue and 17th Street. ''He was getting too much press.'' 'As Smooth as Always'Mr. Pineda said when residents now tell people that they are from Covenant House they ''look at you different.''But Raymond Wilkes, who recently left the Covenant House shelter on West 41st Street, disagreed.''He's making himself look guilty,'' Mr. Wilkes said. ''He had the counselors behind him and the residents. By pulling away like this he's showing the kids what it's like to be weak.''
1141	 2012	a	Kevork Djansezian/Getty ImagesRyan Seacrest is on the verge of completing a new contract with NBCUniversal, the company that owns the E! channel, where he is a host and a producer; Bravo, where he is a supplier of programming; and NBC, where he will soon appear sometimes on the “Today” show.He is likely to announce an expanded relationship with the company when he comes on “Today” on Tuesday morning. The appearance was teased on Sunday night by Jim Bell, the executive producer of “Today,” who wrote in a Twitter message, “Tuesday morning live on the TODAY show in Studio 1A, Ryan Seacrest will make a big NBC announcement.”Mr. Bell followed up by wondering aloud on Twitter, would Mr. Seacrest “have more fun doing the weather for Al,” referring to Al Roker, “or having a cocktail in the 10am with Kathie Lee? What is your drink Ryan?”Mr. Seacrest and his representatives have been negotiating for months with NBCUniversal, a unit of Comcast, over a new package for him. Among its many pieces, some of which are not yet known, the package will include a coveted role for him on NBC’s coverage of the Olympics.It will not place him on “Today” full-time, as has been speculated by some, but it will set him up for occasional contributions to the network morning show — potentially for “a few weeks a year,” according to a person with knowledge of the negotiations, who insisted on anonymity because of the confidential nature of the negotiations.For Comcast, Mr. Seacrest already co-hosts and produces “E! News” and heads the channel’s red-carpet coverage at the Oscars. He will retain a significant role at E!, though maybe not as a daily news host.Mr. Seacrest’s company also produces the E! channel’s multiple Kardashian shows and Bravo’s new reality show, “Shahs of Sunset.” Apart from Comcast, Mr. Seacrest also co-hosts the “New Year’s Rockin’ Eve” special on ABC, hosts a weekday morning radio show for Clear Channel and hosts “American Idol” for Fox.The new package with Comcast will not put Mr. Seacrest on “The Voice,” NBC’s new singing competition, despite the network’s rumored interest in having him take the helm of that show, a rival to “American Idol.” The owners of “Idol” are believed to be in separate negotiations with Mr. Seacrest for a new contract.Mr. Bell’s Twitter message about Mr. Seacrest gained attention on Sunday night because “Today” is trying to blunt the competition this week from “Good Morning America,” its morning rival. “G.M.A.” has Katie Couric, a former co-host of “Today,” guest-hosting for a week.A role on “Today” for Mr. Seacrest has been bandied about at least since last December, when he met with Mr. Bell and other NBC News executives. When the meeting was made public by The Wall Street Journal a day later, Mr. Seacrest was portrayed as a possible successor to Matt Lauer, the longtime co-host of “Today,” whose contract expires at the end of this year. But that possibility was more theoretical than real, at least in the short-term.A spokeswoman for Mr. Seacrest declined to comment on Sunday night. A spokeswoman for “Today” did not respond to a request for comment.

5627	 1986	a	More than 20,000 people sought political asylum in Switzerland last year, the most in one year since World War II, with many coming from Sri Lanka, Zaire and Uganda. Many Swiss contend that people from these countries will never fit into Switzerland's European culture.The Government proposal would limit registration for nonresident foreign students to those below the age of 16 in private schools and below 22 in universities. The anger that it has provoked was expressed in a weekly magazine, L'Hebdo, which headlined a recent full-page editorial, ''A Stupid Hunt for Foreigners.''The point the French-language weekly and many educators are trying to make is that ''hunting'' for the kind of foreigners who attend private schools and the nation's universities will do nothing to reduce the number of asylum seekers or foreigners who enter the country as students and then seek work. They say it can only cause serious economic harm, not only to the operators of the schools but to the states where they are situated.''If you are paying 45,000 Swiss francs a year for schooling, I don't think you are going to go out and try to make some pocket money working as a waitress,'' Mrs. Neri said.Francis A. Clivaz, president and founder of the College du Leman in Versoix, a suburb of Geneva, said the new law could cut drastically into the 600 million to 700 million Swiss francs the educators and tourist officials estimate private students bring into the country each year in the form of payments for tuition, room and board and spending money.

6226	 1973	a	Dozens of airports across the country are planning to place all or parts of their passenger concourses off limits to everyone but passengers as they prepare, under Federal mandate, to tighten security to snare potential hijacker's.The move will bring a fundamental change in the experience of taking an airplane trip: No longer, at many airports, will friends, relatives and others be able to wait with passengers before takeoff in lounges adjacent to boarding gates, or be able to meet them as they step off planes.Instead, passengers and well‐wishers will say their good‐byes, or hellos, in ticket lobbies or elsewhere at the airport away from the long, finger‐like concourses that at most jetports lead from lobbies to boarding gates.“I think you're going to see this concept used whereever it is physically possible,” Frank Cardman, director of security for Pan Amereican World Airways, said in an interview last week.

1685	 2009	a	Chrysler, founded in 1925, has had a tumultuous history as the third-largest of Detroit’s auto companies. Known in the years after World War II for its well-engineered cars, it has spent the last three decades bouncing between highs and lows, The New York Times’s Micheline Maynard writes.Facing financial difficulties in the late 1990s, Chrysler merged with Daimler, the German automaker, in 1998. The conjoined company, DaimlerChrysler, was split apart in 2007, in a deal with Cerberus Capital Management.The company encountered financial turbulence in the late 1970s that prompted it to seek a Congressional bailout, a process that vaulted its chief executive, Lee A. Iacocca, to national prominence. Chrysler paid off the loans early in the 1980s, when it enjoyed success thanks to its minivans and a family of fuel-efficient autos called the K-cars.In 1987, Chrysler bought the No. 4 automaker, American Motors, but the subsequent consolidation prompted another financial crisis that led to a restructuring of the company. In the 1990s, Chrysler came back again, with vehicles like the powerful Dodge Viper sports car and its Jeep lineup. In 1998, Chrysler was acquired by Daimler-Benz of Germany and spent the next eight years as part of DaimlerChrysler.But its inconsistent financial results and pressure from German shareholders prompted Daimler to seek a buyer in 2007. It sold the company to Cerberus Capital Management, an investment fund, which installed Robert L. Nardelli, the former chief executive of Home Depot, as its chief executive. Mr. Nardelli vowed that Chrysler would make a comeback as an American-owned company, yet the automaker, like others in Detroit, was battered by a deep sales slump last year as a recession took hold.In November, Chrysler joined General Motors in seeking assistance from Congress, which rejected the company’s bid, forcing the Bush administration to step in with a financial lifeline. In January, Chrysler announced it had reached a tentative deal with Fiat, and in March, President Obama gave the companies 30 days to conclude the transaction.That effort culminated in a restructuring plan in which Fiat would take a major role in the company’s management and the United Automobile Workers and major lenders agreed to concessions. But with the Obama administration unable to get support from all of the bondholders for the plan, it is now up to a federal bankruptcy court to determine the details of Chrysler’s immediate future.Go to Article from The New York Times »

3561	 1999	a	The resulting portrayal is of Washington as the ambitious yet reluctant leader. He turns away from power at nearly every critical moment in his career, starting from the end of his military service. He did not want to be Virginia's delegate to the Constitutional Convention, nor the nation's first president, and he did not want to serve a second term. He was melancholy and, from today's perspective, unduly pessimistic about how the experiment that was the United States would turn out.''Our Affairs, generally, seem really, to be approaching to some awful crisis,'' he wrote Knox from the Constitutional Convention in 1787. ''God only knows what the result will be. It shall be my part to hope for the best; as to see this Country happy whilst I am gliding down the stream of life in tranquil retirement is so much the wish of my Soul.''There are letters in which Washington agonizes over his ownership of slaves, including correspondence in which he considers leasing Mount Vernon to, as he obliquely put it, ''liberate a certain species of property which I possess, very repugnantly to my own feelings.'' The slaves were not freed until the execution of Washington's will, which can also be viewed as a published pamphlet at the Morgan. At times Washington's sentiments seemed conflicted: in another letter he advises a friend on ways to trick an escaped slave back into service.Washington's correspondence here is unfailingly fascinating. A letter from the battlefield finds Washington the general begging for gunpowder to arm his troops. Later he turns to a neighbor for a loan to pay for the trip to his Inauguration. ''Never 'till within these last two yrs I have experienced the want of money,'' he wrote. ''Under this statement I am inclined to do what I have never expected to be reduced to the necessity of doing -- that is, to borrow money upon interest.'' Washington found himself in these straits partly because he declined a salary while commanding the Continental Army, though he did file an expense account. He claimed $64,335.30 over eight and half years, including reimbursement for his laundry.Often it is the medium itself -- the written letter -- that is the most stirring aspect of this exhibition, starting with those written by Washington, but also including some of his contemporaries. Martha Washington wrote from her camp outside Boston in the winter of 1775, ''Some days we have a number of Cannon and shells from Boston and Bunkers Hill, but it does not seem to surprise anyone but me; I confess I shudder every time I hear the sound of a gun.''And John Adams, an aging man writing in a cramped hand, offers a rather prickly judgment of Washington after his death. In words that resonate today Adams describes the first president as one of the ''great masters of the theatrical exhibitions of politics.'' He added, ''Washington understood this art very well, and we may say of him if he was not the greatest President, he was the best actor of Presidency we have ever had.''

1250	 2012	a	PhotoAfter the floodwaters created by Hurricane Sandy began receding from the Midland Beach neighborhood of Staten Island, one of the first things that Aiman Youseff did was to set up a table on the sidewalk near what was left of his house at 489 Midland Avenue.Over the next month that patch of pavement was used by hundreds of people who either lived on the island or traveled there to help those in need. The volunteers began referring to the spot outside Mr. Youseff’s house as a hub and it became part of a network of similar places — churches, community centers and street corners — that were used as assembly points and distribution centers.The volunteers gave out hot food and warm clothes and, eventually, formed groups to tear sodden, moldy drywall from flooded homes and help residents to rebuild. Several organizations including Occupy Sandy, an offshoot of Occupy Wall Street, and another volunteer group called the Yellow Team also used the location. Mounds of donated supplies quickly took up the entire sidewalk for half a block in front of LaRocca’s Family Restaurant.Now some are worried that the city may try to halt their organizing efforts. On Thursday and Friday, those people said, a city official told them that they would have to dismantle their operation.According to Farid Kader, 29, a Staten Island resident and a volunteer, the official identified himself as Ronald Cohen and said he worked for the mayor’s office.“He told us, ‘we’re moving you out,’ ” Mr. Kader said. “He told us it was unsafe. That’s the word he used.”After that, Mr. Kader said, the official ordered a Red Cross truck that was delivering supplies to the area to leave.Reached at a cellphone number that he left with Mr. Youseff, Mr. Cohen told a reporter he would call back, but did not. Officials did not respond to several telephone calls to City Hall on Saturday and Sunday. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s press secretary, Marc LaVorgna, did not reply to e-mails asking to confirm the official worked for the mayor’s office and whether his message to the volunteers expressed the city’s position.Mr. Kader and others said that they had no desire to fight with the city. Still, they added, the volunteers had worked hard for weeks to help people in the immediate aftermath of the storm when official city aid was barely visible.“If it wasn’t for the volunteers, nothing would be getting done out here,” he said. “If they wanted to start a site on Midland Avenue themselves we would clap hands and walk away.”Several of the New York neighborhoods that suffered the worst storm damage are on Staten Island. Volunteer groups were the first to arrive in many areas where residents needed help and members of several groups said that the city should allow them to continue, even if official agencies assume more control over operations.“We have been providing everything from hot food and tampons to bleach and crowbars,” said a volunteer, Hannah Scott. “The sense of having that taken away is creating panic.”After the official’s visit, some volunteers said, police commanders arrived on Midland Avenue and said that the hub could use part, but not all of the sidewalk.On Saturday the volunteers moved the hub’s kitchen onto a driveway off the street. Using money donated from friends, they built a raised plywood platform for the kitchen and erected two white tarps overhead.Along Midland Avenue a single line of folding tables remained, stacked with donated goods including cans of green beans, diapers, Red Cross blankets, jars of baby food and tubes of toothpaste.

He finished with 24 completions in 40 attempts.The Monarchs (2-0) fell behind in the opening minutes against the Knights' run-and-shoot offense but used their superior bulk and strength to wear down the visitors and score 19 points in the third quarter.The Knights (0-2) scored on their first series. Running back Eric Wilkerson went 74 yards to the 1-yard on the third play of the game and quarterback Jeff Graham scored two plays later on a keeper.

1456	 2010	a	Google, like other leading technology companies, funds university research in fields where its interest and the interest of science coincide. Until now, the company has done that mainly with lots of smaller grants, typically $50,000 or so.But Google is stepping up its funding. In a focused approach to be announced on Tuesday, the company is making a $5.7 million commitment to a dozen university research projects. The money is earmarked for four areas: machine learning, the use of cellphones as data collection devices in science, energy efficiency in computing and privacy.“We’ve identified four extremely important areas, both to Google and to society,” said Alfred Spector, the company’s vice president of research and special initiatives.The unrestricted grants range in size from $100,000 to $1.5 million and are for projects that usually span two or three years to complete. All of the recipients are universities in the United States, other than one to Cambridge University.The program points to how Google’s research agenda has evolved and expanded. Three years ago, three of the four research areas would not have been on the company’s priority list, Mr. Spector said. The only one that was a priority then and now is machine learning, a vital ingredient in search technology.Google didn’t have a cellphone operating system three years ago, Mr. Spector said. Data center energy efficiency has become a technical challenge and environmental concern, he said. And privacy, too, is a more pressing issue for Google as it has moved increasingly beyond searching the public Internet to also collecting personal data in its Gmail and calendar services, for example.Three of the four research groups are in fields where Google could be said to be playing offense: Improvements in machine learning, cellphone data collection and energy efficiency would all help boost the company’s profits.The fourth area — privacy — has more the look of defense: It is presumably in Google’s interest to promote the development of privacy-handling tools that forestall federal regulations. Four of the 12 research projects are in the field of privacy.One of privacy projects is at Carnegie Mellon University, where a team led by Lorrie Faith Cranor is conducting technology-and-behavior research into what they call “privacy nudges.” Will people pay a bit more to purchase goods from Web sites that have tighter practices for handling personal data? Early work by the Carnegie Mellon team, which includes Alessandro Acquisti and Norman Sadeh, suggests that they will.More than half of the users in experiments, Ms. Cranor said, were willing to pay a bit more for goods on Web sites the researchers designated as having better privacy practices. The premium was about 60 cents on a $10 purchase. The percentage went even higher, she noted, when the research involved “privacy-sensitive products,” such as condoms and sex toys.“We’re trying to understand how people make privacy decisions online, and if there were easy-to-use privacy meters on Web sites, how such tools would influence their decisions,” Ms. Cranor said.

1823	 2008	a	With an eye toward the next campaign season in New York City when top offices will be up for election, Ray Rivera finds that donations from the real estate industry, traditionally a dependable source of campaign contributions, have soared to three and four times the rate of previous election cycles as part of an effort to beat strict new limits. The surge is driven in large part by a major overhaul in the city’s campaign finance law, which, starting this month, will cap contributions from people who do business with the city at less than a tenth of what is now permissible. That means many developers, brokers, landlords and contractors will be limited to giving $400 to a mayoral candidate, compared with $4,950 now.The Times examined contributions from executives and others affiliated with 25 of the city’s most prominent property management, brokerage and real estate development companies and found Councilwoman Melinda Katz, chairwoman of the powerful Land Use Committee, had received the largest amount in donations: $196,266 from the 25 companies.Giuliani Down, but Maybe Not for LongRudolph W. Giuliani may have temporarily diminished his marketability, both as a $100,000-an-appearance public speaker and as a purveyor of corporate advice, after his presidential bid resulted in bruising news coverage of his personal and professional life and his campaign strategy was widely panned, Eric Lipton writes.In addition, Giuliani Partners, which provides corporate consulting and security advice, clearly suffered during the campaign as his attention was focused elsewhere, according to former and current executives. Its client list declined, as did revenues, they said. The company has about 50 employees, down from roughly 60 a few months ago, and several pending departures involve people in ranking positions. But despite his poor showing in the campaign, Mr. Giuliani remains attractive to corporate clients looking for access to government officials in New York or Washington, particularly if Senator John McCain, whom Mr. Giuliani has endorsed, wins the presidency.One person whose visibility was reinvigorated by the Giuliani campaign was the Academy Award-winning actor Jon Voight, who became a fixture on the Giuliani campaign plane, in the Giuliani campaign bus and at Giuliani campaign events in the waning weeks of the failed bid.Female Voters Make Their CaseInterviews with dozens of women across New York — a crucial part of the Democratic primary — show that many are bringing an intense, almost visceral connection to the election, according to an article by Anemona Hartocollis. How women vote will be critical in a state with one of the biggest delegate prizes on Super Tuesday, since they represent 55 percent of registered Democrats statewide and 60 percent in the city. A statewide poll released last week showed Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ahead among all women, though black women strongly favored Senator Barack Obama. But black women were also more likely to be undecided than most other groups.Principals Angry Over Sudden Budget SlashingPrincipals across New York City discovered on Thursday morning that their budgets had been slashed overnight by sums ranging from $9,000 to $447,587, as a result of the city’s new tighter budget. They reacted with unvarnished fury, in part because the cuts come in the middle of the year, when they have already hired teachers, planned their schools’ schedules and promised their students and parents certain perks, like after-school programs. Many principals vented their anger in pointed e-mail messages.The Giants Haven’t Played in New York Since Disco Was PopularClyde Haberman’s NYC column looks ahead at the showdown most immediately in New Yorker’ minds. No, not Super Tuesday: the Super Bowl. It turns out that Super Bowl bets placed between the mayors of Boston and New York City (as well as the governors of Massachusetts and New York) has irked the mayor of East Rutherford, N.J., where the Giants actually play. “Perhaps they have to check their G.P.S.’s,” Mayor James L. Cassella said. “Maybe it will tell them that East Rutherford is not in their state or their city.”Other News from The TimesThe Public Lives column profiles Marcus Cederqvist, the 37-year-old baby-faced new executive director of the Board of Elections, who is making his debut as the city’s chief vote counter for Tuesday’s New York presidential primary.Susan Dominus’s Big City column contrasts two feminists from two generations: the 29-year-old blogger who founded the popular feminist site Feministing.com and the head of the New York State chapter of N.O.W., who fired off a press release saying that Senator Edward M.

2657	 2004	a	WASHINGTON, Sept. 30 - Not quite halfway into the debate on Thursday night, answering a question about the lessons of Iraq, President Bush repeated a line he uses so often on the campaign trail to justify his decision to invade: "The enemy attacked us," he said, and "we would rue the day" if the United States left Saddam Hussein in power.Senator John Kerry was waiting for that moment. "Saddam Hussein didn't attack us," Mr. Kerry shot back. "Osama bin Laden attacked us." Mr. Bush, he said, had strengthened Al Qaeda with a war in Iraq that was a "diversion" in the broader war on terrorism.With that exchange, the two men crystallized an argument that has bubbled along for months now, an argument over whether toppling Saddam Hussein was the right course or the wrong one for a nation suddenly confronted with a set of threats that were never aired during the last presidential campaign. It captured, in a moment of head-to-head clarity rarely seen in this campaign so far, the starkly different ways the Vietnam veteran and the sitting commander in chief view the question of when diplomacy has been exhausted, and how to focus the resources of a superpower that, for all its strength, cannot deploy its armies on every potential battlefield.On everything from the question of whether the coalition that Mr. Bush put together to attack Iraq was truly a global alliance for a global war on terrorism or a Potemkin coalition of convenience, to whether Mr. Bush deserved credit for breaking up the world's most dangerous network of nuclear salesmen or has left bomb material lying around for terrorists to seize, the two men chose their facts to bolster their arguments for taking very different roads. Along the way, each rewrote recent history a bit.

6197	 1975	a	GREENWICH, Conn., Oct. 31 —The 15‐year‐old daughter of a Greenwich executive was found bludgeoned to death this afternoon in a clump of bushes 200 feet from her home in the exclusive Belle Haven estate section here.The body of the girl, Martha ITVIoxley, still clad in the blue ski !parka and blue dungarees she wore when she left home last !night to visit friends, was found ‘shortly after noon today by Sheila McGuire. a 15‐year‐old ‘neighbor and classmate of the dead girl at Greenwich High School.Thomas Keegan, detective captain of the Greenwich police, said Miss Moxley had apIparently been killed by a blow to the back of the head in an attack that took place not more than a few feet from the Moxley home.The body of Miss Moxley, who was 5 feet 5 inches tall, weighed 120 pounds and had long, blond hair, was then apparently dragged to a nearby clump of bushes, where it remained undiscovered for hours despite an intensive search of the estate and surrounding neighborhood by policemen, who were alerted by the victim's mother, Dorothy, at 3:45 A.M.

4593	 1992	a	FROM the mid-1970's to the mid-80's, museum exhibitions of corporate art collections were nearly commonplace. But they are rare today, and it is not because business has lost interest in the subject.Far from it. In the last decade, the number of companies acquiring art has gone from 300 to about 1,200, according to the Directory of Corporate Art Collections.Still, it seems that more corporations are keeping their art at home for the edification of their employees and for visiting clients. Whatever the reasons -- and no doubt the growing cost of insurance is one of them -- they have not deterred the 13 companies represented in "Corporations Collect I" at the Morris Museum.The most venerable lender is the chemicals manufacturer Ciba-Geigy, which began acquiring in 1959 and now owns about 600 works. Initiated 10 years later, the holdings of the Prudential Insurance Company now total more than 11,000 items; the Chemical Bank has gathered 2,000 pieces gathered over the same period. And, in 20 years, A.T.& T. has amassed 3,500 works. As collectors, the remaining corporations are Johnny-come-latelies, but Schering-Plough and Nabisco maintain galleries that display New Jersey artists.
916	 2013	a	PhotoCervantes, through Don Quixote, provides this 407-year-old bit of inspiration for diving into a new year in turbulent, consequential and complicated times:“For come, tell me, can there be anything more delightful than to see, as it were, here now displayed before us a vast lake of bubbling pitch with a host of snakes and serpents and lizards, and ferocious and terrible creatures of all sorts swimming about in it, while from the middle of the lake there comes a plaintive voice saying: ‘Knight, whosoever thou art who beholdest this dread lake, if thou wouldst win the prize that lies hidden beneath these dusky waves, prove the valour of thy stout heart and cast thyself into the midst of its dark burning waters, else thou shalt not be worthy to see the mighty wonders contained in the seven castles of the seven Fays that lie beneath this black expanse;’ and then the knight, almost ere the awful voice has ceased, without stopping to consider, without pausing to reflect upon the danger to which he is exposing himself, without even relieving himself of the weight of his massive armour, commending himself to God and to his lady, plunges into the midst of the boiling lake, and when he little looks for it, or knows what his fate is to be, he finds himself among flowery meadows, with which the Elysian fields are not to be compared.”It’s a passage that’s been in my head since I heard it recited in stentorian tones in the mid 1970s by the remarkable Sears R. Jayne, a Brown University professor of comparative literature (emeritus for many years now), when I took his course in comparative Renaissance literature.It came in handy around 1995, when I was wooing the woman who is now my wife (I still have the aging sheet on which I typed it).This kind of exhortation feels right now, as well, whether your role in confronting global challenges, and opportunities, is as a scientist, communicator, inventor, teacher, student, elected leader or simply human being.

3630	 1998	a	Stores that do a lot of their own private-label business in Asia have also benefited from the region's woes, although in many cases any gains are offset by the instability of suppliers, some of whom may not stay afloat. And Asian suppliers who buy their raw materials outside their country are being hammered by the currency ills, raising their costs.But the savings to consumers are clearly beginning to trickle in. ''We expect to receive price concessions from our existing overseas manufacturers, allowing us to pass on savings to our customers,'' said Terry J. Lundgren, president of Federated Department Stores Inc.'s merchandising unit. Federated owns Macy's and Bloomingdale's, as well as other department store chains.In the consumer electronics business, which has also shown modest price decreases, retailers say that most of the price cuts are in products that have simply lost value with age. Nintendo 64, for example, sold for $249 at Toys ''R'' Us when it first came out; it can now be purchased for half that price.The Import Price Index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that prices of imported toys and various other electronic goods fell last month. Indeed, between March 1997 and March 1998, import prices of consumer goods (excluding autos) fell nine-tenths of a percent. ''There is a strong correlation between price deflation and deflation in import prices,'' said Edward Yardeni, an economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in New York.In some cases, while prices may not be falling, retailers are trying to beef up what they are getting for their money. ''There are some opportunities for lower costs,'' said Susan Eich, a spokeswoman for the Dayton Hudson Corporation, ''and we are using that to improve and upgrade quality.'' Some furniture sold at the company's Target discount stores, for instance, will now have extra features for the same price, she said.Of course, retailers, especially of things like computers and televisions, where margins are razor thin, would love to bolster their balance sheets with these savings. But with rare exception this will not be possible.Most of the savings are occurring among routine commodity items, where competition is stiff and price is the main draw. ''Retailers are so competitive,'' Mr. Glassman said, ''that if one company gives consumers an edge, everyone else is forced to do it.''

3299	 2000	a	Aetna Inc. and the ING Group, the Dutch financial services company, said yesterday that they were discussing a new offer from ING to buy Aetna's financial and international divisions. Aetna declined to discuss the price under negotiation, but some Wall Street traders estimated it could be as high as $9 billion, only slightly less than the roughly $10 billion ING had offered for all of Aetna earlier this year.Aetna shares rose $5 at midday after CNBC reported the ING offer, and closed up $4.0625 at $66.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.William H. Donaldson, chief executive of Aetna, said his company was ''working with ING on their new proposal concerning our financial services and international businesses.'' He added that Aetna was still committed to improving its Aetna U.S. Healthcare unit, the nation's largest health insurer. ING said in a statement that Aetna's ''domestic U.S. health care operations are not part of these negotiations.''Mr. Donaldson said there were ''no assurances'' that the ING deal would close or what the terms would be.

3191	 2001	a	With only a week to go before trade ministers are scheduled to gather in Doha, Qatar, to try to set the agenda for a worldwide trade accord, actions the United States has taken since the terrorist attacks appear to have widened the gap between rich and poor nations and persuaded some negotiators that the meeting could become a casualty of war.The Bush administration's tussle with Bayer A.G. -- in which Washington forced the company to sharply reduce the price of its anthrax drug Cipro -- has emboldened developing countries to insist on a broad ''public health'' exception to international patent rules for other drugs, like those used to keep AIDS victims alive.India, Nigeria and many others are also arguing that if the United States can cede special trading rights to Pakistan's textile and apparel makers to help a frontline ally, it should ease barriers for clothing makers in all poor countries.Disputes over patent rules and textile quotas have been around for years. But the exigencies of fighting terrorism have cast the matter into stark relief and set off a heated debate in Geneva, where negotiators for 142 nations in the World Trade Organization had hoped to be narrowing their differences ahead of the meeting.

1829	 2008	a	Aired Friday night on NBC: Happy Leap Year! This is February 29th. How about that? In fact, when President Bush heard that, he said, “Remember, turn your clocks ahead one year, everybody.”In a press conference today, President Bushannounced America is not headed into a recession, especially if you own an oil company.High gas prices leave a bad taste in people’s mouths. Have you noticed that? That’s mostly from the siphoning, but still, it’s a horror.In fact, gas is so expensive in LA, now when you call 911, they ask you to meet the ambulance halfway.Yesterday President Bush said that last year an intelligence gap opened up. Last year? Gee, didn’t that open up about 2001, right after the inauguration?Just 48 hours after Homeland Security officials told Congress a 28-mile long virtual fence along the U.S.-Mexican border was working, they now say it will be delayed three years because they can’t get the video surveillance to work. Isn’t that amazing? Do you realize, Homeland Security has less video surveillance than the New England Patriots.And in movie news, the movie “Panic Room 2″ is now in development. The whole thing’s going to be filmed at Hillary Clinton’s campaign headquarters.And more problems with John McCain. The New York Times is now saying there is a question as to whether McCain is eligible to become president because he was born in Panama. See, his parents were in the military, so he was born in Panama. In fact, the reason they moved away from Panama, the building of the canal was keeping the young John McCain up.Now, I don’t want to say McCain is old, but yesterday he accidentally got on the wrong bus, ended up taking a gambling junket to Atlantic City.See, everyone is so concerned now, where all the candidates were born. You know, McCain was born on a military base in Panama, Hillary was born outside Chicago, and if you believe the media, Barack Obama was born in a manger.

2561	 2004	a	DESPITE the ultramodern aura of devices that play compressed digital music files, from the Apple iPod player to the Rio Karma, they all share one anachronistic trait: they only have two audio channels. The basic stereo format used on vinyl records since the 1950's and carried over to CD's in the 1980's still defines most recorded music.By contrast, DVD movies come with Dolby Digital 5.1-channel soundtracks that can parcel the audio among five speakers (and a subwoofer for extra-low tones) to provide the illusion that you are inside the action, surrounded by sound.Such surround-sound or multichannel audio is making its way into recorded music through high-end entertainment systems that play Super Audio CD's or DVD Audio discs. But surround sound may soon come to the Internet and hand-held music players as well.The Fraunhofer Institute, the German research center that led the effort to create the MP3 digital music format, recently announced a new version called MP3 Surround that adds the extra audio channels needed for 5.1 sound without appreciably increasing file size. According to Jürgen Herre of the institute, MP3 Surround files can also play in conventional stereo mode on two-channel devices.

1724	 2009	a	Location: East Lansing, Mich.Nickname: Spartans.2008 Countdown ranking: No. 29.What I said in last year’s preview:I’m not going so far as to say Michigan State will upend Ohio State, Wisconsin or Penn State for the Big Ten crown, but there is no doubt Dantonio has this program primed for an eight-win season. However, question marks exist at the receiver position and on the defensive line, two positions of strength for the Spartans a season ago. Over all, I predict an 8-4 finish for the Spartans, with losses coming at Cal to start the season and to Ohio State, Wisconsin and Penn State in Big Ten play. A one-win improvement would be a strong step forward from 2007, especially if the Spartans can make up two games (from 3-5 to 5-3) in conference. In addition, Michigan State hasn’t had back-to-back winning seasons since 1989-90.Postseason re-ranking: No. 23.2008 record and recap: (9-4, 6-2). A sterling season for Michigan State, one made even sweeter by the struggles of rival Michigan. The Spartans would actually have more wins at the end of September (four) than the Wolverines would post all season, and continued to ride a tough offense and opportunistic defense to nine wins, its most since 1999. Neither the offense nor the defense were especially dominating, though each played very well in spurts, but the Spartans did enough to keep itself in most games. Minus the regular season tussles with Penn State and Ohio State, the top teams in the Big Ten. If anything, those games showed that while the Spartans have made terrific strides in its two seasons under Mark Dantonio, the program still has some work to do before being considered a preseason favorite to win the conference. That’s truly the only negative I can find with this team. In order to build upon last year’s success, Michigan State must replace a handful of contributors, most notably at quarterback and running back.High point: A 35-21 win over Michigan was certainly a highlight, especially when considering the Spartans hadn’t won at the Big House in 19 years. However, the best wins of the season came earlier that month, when M.S.U. beat Iowa (by 16-13) and Northwestern (by 37-20) in back-to-back weeks.Low point: Michigan State played three ranked teams – Georgia, Penn State and Ohio State – and lost the three by an average of 27 points per game. The fourth loss was at California in the season opener (by 38-31), which while disappointing is far from a low point.Tidbit: Michigan State has lost its last 12 games against Top 25 opposition. Nine of those 12 have come against Big Ten competition, with the other three losses coming to Georgia, Boston College and Notre Dame. The Fighting Irish were actually the last Top 25 team to lose to the Spartans, dropping a 44-41 overtime decision in September 2005.Tidbit (scoring edition): Of the five teams to finish above .500 in the Big Ten a season ago, Michigan State was the only one to be outscored in conference play. The Spartans scored 201 points and allowed 208; however, to be fair, those numbers are quite skewed due to the blowout losses at the hands of Ohio State (by 45-7) and Penn State (by 45-18).Former players in the N.F.L.: 30 – OT Flozell Adams (Dallas Cowboys), DT Matthias Askew (Denver Broncos), TE Chris Baker (New England Patriots), DE Ervin Baldwin (Chicago Bears), RB Jehuu Caulcrick (Jets), OT Peter Clifford (Tennessee Titans), C Kyle Cook (Cincinnati Bengals), TE Kellen Davis (Chicago Bears), RB T.J. Duckett (Seattle Seahawks), P Brandon Fields (Miami Dolphins), LB David Herron (Minnesota Vikings), S Renaldo Hill (Denver Broncos), QB Brian Hoyer (New England Patriots), DT Justin Kershaw (Carolina Panthers), DB Travis Key (Indianapolis Colts), DT Brandon McKinney (Baltimore Ravens), C Chris Morris (Oakland Raiders), WR Muhsin Muhammad (Carolina Panthers), DT Ogemdi Nwagbuo (San Diego Chargers), DT Domata Peko (Cincinnati Bengals), LB Julian Peterson (Detroit Lions), K Dave Rayner (Washington Redskins), RB Javon Ringer (Tennessee Titans), DT Clifton Ryan (St. Louis Rams), S Eric Smith (Jets), DE Robaire Smith (Cleveland Browns), QB Drew Stanton (Detroit Lions), WR Devin Thomas (Washington Redskins), DT Kevin Vickerson (Tennessee Titans).Top five N.F.L. players from Michigan State: Michigan State might not have the over all talent to rank among the top three, but I’m not sure if I’ve come many other programs with as much depth (Pittsburgh was one, if I remember correctly). For example, a quick taste of who missed the cut: quarterback Earl Morrall, linebackers Brad Van Pelt and George Webster, linemen Flozell Adams, Bubba Smith and Ray Wietecha, tight end Fred Arbanas and wide receivers Muhsin Muhammad and Derrick Mason. I chose Rison over the latter pair. Any complaints?1. CB Herb Adderley (Green Bay, Dallas; 1961-72)2. OG Joe DeLamielleure (Buffalo, Cleveland; 1973-85)3.

The former Spartans assistant (1995-2000) was hired to replace John L. Smith, whose four-year career in East Lansing ended with three straight losing seasons. Dantonio’s impact was immediate, both on the field and off; beyond merely returning the Spartans to bowl play, he instilled a sense of discipline and toughness that was highly lacking during Smith’s difficult tenure. With Michigan’s slide last fall, Dantonio and the Spartans were able to make up ground among in the historically one-sided rivalry. Dantonio became a candidate for a big-time job during his three-year stint as the coach at Cincinnati, where he finished with a record of 18-17, including 7-5 in 2006. The Bearcats were bowl eligible in two of those three seasons; in 2004, Dantonio became the first Bearcats coach in 23 years to finish with a winning record in his first season: 7-5, plus a victory over Marshall in the Forth Worth Bowl. Though Dantonio’s six years as a Michigan State assistant certainly played a large role in his early success as a head coach, it was during his time as an Ohio State assistant that he became a truly made his name in the coaching ranks. Dantonio served three seasons as the Buckeyes defensive coordinator under Jim Tressel, earning acclaim for his stingy defenses, most notably during a national title run in 2002. The Buckeyes went 32-6 during his three years as coordinator. His connection to Tressel dates back to Youngstown State, where Dantonio coached under him from 1986-90. What must be reassuring to Michigan State fans is that Dantonio doesn’t coach with smoke and mirrors: He preached to his team a more traditional philosophy – scrapping Smith’s spread attack – illustrating an overall recommitment to the style of play that propelled the program to five straight non-losing seasons from 1995-1999.Returning starters: 15 (7 offense, 8 defense).Key losses: Four starters must be replaced on offense, starting with the all-American running back Javon Ringer. He was the heart and soul of last season’s offense, rushing for 1,637 yards and a school-record 22 touchdowns. He finished with 390 carries, a massive total for an N.F.L. season (the league record is 416) but an unbelievable output in a 13-game college season. All told, Ringer’s senior totals accounted for a whopping 97 percent of Michigan State’s team rushing and 76 percent of its carries. If we remove sacks allowed from the equation (which count as a carry in college), Ringer made 390 of the team’s 485 carries – 80 percent. Few players meant more to their team than the Doak Walker Award finalist. Not to say Ringer was a one-year wonder: he rushed for 1,447 yards (on 245 carries) as a junior, and a combined 1,314 yards as a freshman and sophomore. The Spartans also lost a two-year starter in quarterback Brian Hoyer. Ringer’s play put the Michigan State passing game on the back burner, as Hoyer’s senior totals will attest: 2,404 yards on 51.0 percent passing with 9 touchdowns and 9 interceptions. Contrast that with Hoyer’s junior season, when he threw for 2,725 yards (completing 59.3 percent of his passes) with 20 touchdowns against 11 picks. Hoyer’s most impressive statistic was his 16 victories and two bowl appearances over his two seasons as the starter. The right side of the M.S.U. offensive line starters Roland Martin and Jesse Miller, each of whom earned second-team all-conference honors as seniors. This pair held down the right of the line for the last three seasons, with Miller starting the final 38 games of his career. Three starters do return on the M.S.U. front, but the role this pair played in leading Michigan State’s tough running game cannot be overstated.The defensive line has some holes of its own to fill following the departure of tackle Justin Kershaw, a three-year starter, and end Brandon Long. Both were honorable mention all-Big Ten selections as seniors. Kershaw set new career-highs in tackles for loss (eight) and sacks (three) in his final season, while notching 28 tackles, the second-most of his career. He was often used at end in his sophomore season, when he made eight starts, but moved inside full-time as a junior and senior. Long did not break into the starting lineup until his senior season, but played well: 39 tackles (7 for loss) and 5.5 sacks. His tackle for loss total ranked fifth on the team and his sack total second. Ryan Allison’s game of musical chairs (position-wise) ended with him playing weakside linebacker, where he made 50 tackles as a senior. Allison began his career at receiver before moving to safety in 2007 and linebacker in 2008. He was a good fit at linebacker due to his speed, which allowed the Spartans to line him up in nickel packages. The biggest loss on the entire defense is strong safety Otis Wiley, a 2008 first-team all-conference pick and a three-year starter. As a senior, Wiley again led the Spartans with four interceptions, and added 78 tackles (third on the team). He played free safety from 2006-7 (honorable mention pick in 2006) before being moved to strong safety last fall, where he suffered no drop-off in productivity.Players to watch: The Spartans will head into the season with an ongoing battle at quarterback, where the sophomores Kirk Cousins and Keith Nichol have laid claim to the starting role. I’ve been keeping my eye on Nichol for a few seasons now, ever since he spurned M.S.U. as a high school senior to enroll at Oklahoma. After losing out on the starting job with the Sooners to Sam Bradford, Nichol opted to transfer back to his home state, and after sitting out all of last season to N.C.A.A. regulations is eligible to play in 2009. When I read that Nichol was transferring to Michigan State I immediately penciled him in as the starter following his transfer season; however, after Cousins played well as the No. 2 in 2008, he may have the edge in the position battle. In backup duty, Cousins completed 32 of 43 passes (74 percent) for 310 yards and 2 touchdowns. Put up those kinds of numbers, and you move to the front of the pack. Whoever does earn the starting role, expect the reserve to earn plenty of snaps. If Cousins starts, Nichol’s running ability will make him a dangerous second option. Helping to ease the transition to a new starting quarterback is a deep receiver corps, which returns its top three targets from a season ago. The seniors Blair White led the Spartans with 43 receptions last fall, which went for 659 yards and a score. The sophomore B.J. Cunningham added 41 grabs for 528 yards, while the talented junior Mark Dell’s 679 receiving yards (on 41 receptions) paced the team. Dell got off to a hot start, grabbing 9 balls for 202 yards in the season opener against Cal, but hamstring injuries limited his effectiveness in the second half. Also in the mix at receiver are Keshawn Martin and Fred Smith, talented sophomores who will make an impact before the end of their careers. Michigan State returns an all-conference tight end in the senior Charlie Gantt, whose four touchdown grabs led the team. While the right side of the line – so important in the run game – must be replaced, the Spartans do return three starters up front: left tackle Rocco Cironi, left guard Joel Foreman and center Joel Nitchman. Each is capable of earning all-conference accolades. Holding down the two open spots heading into the fall are the sophomore Jared McGaha (guard) and the junior J’Michael Deane. A trio of freshmen (Chris McDonald, Hugh Stangeland and Zach Hunter) will push for playing time on the right side.The Michigan State defense looks be in very good shape. The strength will be at linebacker, where the Spartans have a terrific pair of juniors in Greg Jones and Eric Gordon. Jones, who has led the Spartans in tackles in each of his two seasons, is one of the best linebackers in the Big Ten and a future all-American. As a sophomore, Jones tallied 127 stops (14 for loss, also a team-best) and 2 sacks, earning him first-team all-Big Ten accolades. He began the season on the strongside, where he started the first eight games, before moving to the middle for the final five. He’s projected to start in the middle this fall, with the senior Adam Decker serving as a key reserve. If that is the case, Gordon will go from the weakside to strong. Last fall, Gordon finished second on the team with 85 tackles (7.5 for loss) while adding 3 sacks. The senior Brandon Denson (31 tackles, 1.5 sacks) is the likely starter on the weakside. The line also looks solid, with returning starters Trevor Anderson and Owen Wilson joined by five other 2008 contributors. Anderson, an end, led the Spartans with eight sacks last fall, his first year with the program after transferring in from Cincinnati; he was an honorable mention all-conference pick. The junior Colin Neely is a contender to start opposite Anderson after making three starts last fall, though the sophomores David Rolf and Johnathan Strayhorn will also makes their case for the starting role. I am somewhat concerned with who will replace Kershaw: the sophomore Kevin Pickelman and the redshirt freshman Jerel Worthy are the leaders to start at tackle heading into the fall. Three more starters are back in the secondary. Cornerback is in good hands, as the senior Ross Weaver (28 career starts) and the junior Chris L. Rucker, a 2008 all-conference selection, return for another year in the starting lineup. Two other Spartans, the sophomore Johnny Adams and the senior Ashton Henderson, have made starts in the past and provide depth at cornerback. The situation at safety is a bit muddled. The senior Danny Fortener, who made nine starts at free safety last fall, will move to the strong spot to replace Wiley. He’ll battle the junior Marcus Hyde for the starting role. The senior Kendell Clark-Davis is back at free safety after struggling through injuries last fall (four starts), but may lose his starting role to the sophomore Trenton Robinson, who played well in the spring.Position(s) to watch: Clearly, running back. However, a quick tidbit: Despite Ringer’s monster senior season, the Spartans still averaged only 130.2 yards rushing per game, the ninth-best total in the Big Ten. What does this mean? In my mind, that Michigan State will have a better rushing attack in 2009 – at least statistically. There is also no question that depth will be much improved. M.S.U. could go, given the potential of two incoming freshmen, six deep at running back, though odds are that the Spartans will feature a nice blend of three or four ball-carriers. The most experienced returning back is the senior A.J. Jimmerson, who has served as a reserve over the last two seasons, racking up 205 yards rushing. He’ll get plenty of snaps, as will the sophomore Andre Anderson. The team’s leading returning rusher from a season ago (97 yards), Anderson is likely the most well-rounded back on the roster. After getting his feet wet a season ago, I like Anderson’s chances to serve as the lead back in 2009. Fellow sophomore Ashton Legget, the only Spartan running back other than Ringer to score a touchdown last fall, is another option. Throw in the redshirt freshman Caulton Ray, and the Spartans went four-deep at the position during spring practice. Throw in the talented true freshmen Larry Caper and Edwin Baker, who arrive in the fall, and you have a talented – albeit inexperienced – corps of backs. My feeling is if Anderson can withstand the pounding, he’ll be the top guy. Still, I believe you’ll see a number of returning players earn carries, with Baker the most likely true freshman to break into the mix.2009 schedule:Sept. 5 Montana StateSept. 12 Central MichiganSept. 19 @ Notre DameSept. 26 @ WisconsinOct. 3 MichiganOct. 10 @ IllinoisOct. 17 NorthwesternOct. 24 IowaOct. 31 @ MinnesotaNov. 7 Western MichiganNov. 14 @ PurdueNov. 21 Penn StateGame(s) to watch: No Ohio State, which is good. Early road games with Notre Dame, Wisconsin and Illinois – all three much improved – are not. There is absolutely no question that M.S.U. is good enough to again finish third in the Big Ten, but to do so, it cannot afford to lose more than two games in conference play.Season breakdown & prediction: Here’s how I feel about Michigan State. The Spartans are going to be very good: I’m thinking eight wins and another meaningful bowl appearance. My only rationale for bumping M.S.U. down to fifth in the conference is my belief in Illinois, a team I have making a great improvement over its 2008 finish. I don’t think many can find qualms with Penn State and Ohio State at the top of the Big Ten, nor Iowa – which also lost a terrific running back – coming in third. No slight is meant against the Spartans, with whom I have few concerns. Offensively, I feel the pair of youngsters will at least match Hoyer’s 2008 output, and while no one of the corps of young backs will put up Ringer’s numbers, the group as a whole should improve on the team’s rushing total from a season ago. The defense will continue to grow, and remains young enough to even see improvement on a week-to-week basis. I really like the Spartans: I admire the process by which Dantonio has rebuilt the program, and respect how rapidly the team has closed the gap on rival Michigan (though the Wolverines have helped speed up this process). A somewhat tougher schedule (in my mind, even without O.S.U.) may cost the Spartans one regular season victory, but I don’t have this team losing more than four games heading into bowl play. Last fall’s finish gave M.S.U. back-to-back winning seasons for the first time since 1989-90; if the Spartans match last season’s win total (of which it is more than capable), the team would have nine wins in back-to-back years for the first time since 1965-66.Dream season: A 10-2 finish, 7-1 in the Big Ten, ties the Spartans with Ohio State for the Big Ten lead.Nightmare season: Michigan State’s struggles in the backfield lead to some offensive ineffectiveness, landing the team a 6-6 regular season record.Where do Michigan State fans congregate: Begin with Spartan Tailgate, by leaps and bounds the best independent Michigan State Web site, and continue with SpartanMag.com and GoSpartans.net.

2131	 2007	a	Brooklyn prosecutors said they would drop the murder case against a retired F.B.I. supervisor, Roy Lindley DeVecchio, after tapes discredited the main witness, a gangster’s mistress. The tapes came to light in a report in The Village Voice by the reporter Tom Robbins that showed that the main witness, Linda Schiro, had changed her account and damaged her credibility.As Michael Brick explains in a front-page article, it was a major reversal for the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, who filed state murder charges last year despite a federal investigation that had cleared Mr. DeVecchio, saying the case was “the most stunning example of official corruption that I have ever seen.”The Daily News reports that once the charges are dropped, which is expected to occur today, Mr. Hynes is expected to seek the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate Ms. Schiro for perjury.The New York Post reports that Ms. Schiro never mentioned the 1997 interview tapes in many meetings with prosecutors in the early days of the case and that investigators “were totally blindsided” when The Voice’s article was published online. Prosecutors have been paying Ms. Schiro $2,200 a month for rent and food since March 2006, according to The Post.Real Estate Agent Is Found Slain in Fifth Avenue HomeLinda S. Stein, 62, who helped pioneer the punk music scene, influenced the careers of Madonna and the Ramones and went on to become known as a real estate agent to the stars, was found bludgeoned to death Tuesday night in her apartment at 965 Fifth Avenue, the police said. She was pronounced dead at the scene.The building, at the corner of 78th Street, has the security of doormen and elevator operators, as well as surveillance cameras mounted on the sidewalk canopy and in the lobby, but a reporter found an unlocked service door on the side street. There were no signs of forced entry at the apartment, nor did anything appear to be missing, investigators said. Ms. Stein’s body was found face down in the living room in a pool of blood, the police said. She was wearing a sweatshirt with a hood, which was pulled over her head. Investigators at first believed the bleeding could have resulted from a fall, but when the hood was pulled back, a severe skull injury was exposed. The medical examiner’s office ruled the death a homicide.The New York Post reports that investigators are talking to building employees and a construction crew, among others. As The Daily News notes, Ms. Stein sold 20 to 30 properties a year, often to celebrities, in deals ranging from $2.5 million to $30 million. The real estate agent who shows Charlie Sheen an apartment in the movie “Wall Street” was reportedly based on her.Survivor of Steam Blast Is to Be Released TodayGregory McCullough, 21, a student and tow truck driver from Canarsie, Brooklyn, who was driving with a customer through traffic during the evening rush on July 18 when a steam pipe exploded beneath the intersection of 41st Street and Lexington Avenue, near Grand Central Terminal, is to be released today from NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital. He was critically burned in the accident and placed in a medically induced coma to relieve the tremendous pain. In an interview with Trymaine Lee of The Times, Mr. McCullough recalled: “I woke up and I started to cry. I didn’t understand. Why me? I did everything I was supposed to do. I was making a living and going to school. I didn’t deserve this. I didn’t deserve all of this pain. I didn’t deserve any of this.”Travel Costs Rise Across the RegionIn the past year, New York City cab riders and New Jersey Transit passengers have been asked to pay more. Next month, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board will vote on whether to raise tolls and fares on its subways, buses, commuter rail lines, bridges and tunnels by an average of 6.5 percent. Now the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is hoping to raise tolls by at least a third on its Hudson River crossings early next year — the first increase since 2001. The changes amount to “one of the biggest and most sustained rounds of fare and toll increases in decades,” Ken Belson and William Neuman explain.First Conviction Under State Terror LawIn State Supreme Court in the Bronx, jurors for the first time found a defendant guilty under a New York statute passed after 9/11 to guarantee harsher sentences in terrorism cases.

642	 2015	a	PhotoTequila is growing up and expanding its boundaries — no longer a mere cheap foundation for obliterating, sugary-sweet cocktails. Darker, premium golden-amber-hued añejos, hailing from the rainy highlands and arid valleys outside of Guadalajara, Mexico and aged in wooden barrels for at least 12 months, garner attention all on their own for their sophisticated flavor. This spring gives rise to a new wave of pricier, ultra-aged extra añejos (casked in wood from three to seven years), like Patrón’s rare and limited Extra Añejo 7 Años, which are best enjoyed sipped (pass on the snifter and opt for Riedel’s Vinum Tequila glass — a Champagne-style flute), not mixed into a margarita.But this season, añejo offerings from smaller-batch, indie labels like Suerte Tequila, Partida and Tequila Tapatio — in addition to the larger labels like Patrón, Don Julio, Chinaco and Espolòn — are both high-quality and reasonably priced, with a smart, accessible balance of agave expression and wood. The aging process endows añejo tequila with smoky, peppery notes much like those of whiskey or scotch — and attendant aromas of sweet vanilla, caramel and intense wood, plus that refreshing flash of citrus. They make for a fresh, logical ingredient in classic cocktails like old-fashioneds and manhattans. Below, a trio of handcrafted añejo cocktail recipes from bartenders practicing their craft in a variety of locations, from New York City’s mod, well-received Mexican restaurant Cosme (in Chelsea) to the handsome, dimly-lit subterranean West Village spot the Up & Up to the hip-casual Brooklyn mainstay Extra Fancy, across the Williamsburg Bridge. “Añejo tequilas bridge the gap between the purity and liveliness of a blanco tequila and the round and sophisticated character of oak-aged spirits such as cognac, bourbon or aged rum,” Extra Fancy’s Rob Krueger explains. Añejo-based variations on the Blood and Sand, the Negroni and the Rob Roy follow here.GallardoCreated by Rob Krueger for Extra Fancy in Brooklyn, N.Y.“This drink is a variation of the Scotch cocktail Blood and Sand, which was named for the 1922 Rudolph Valentino film about a bullfighter,” Krueger says. “This version takes its name from the main character’s surname, which means ‘gallant.'”¾ ounce Roca Patrón Añejo¾ ounce Carpano Bianco vermouth¾ ounce Cherry Heering¾ ounce white grapefruit juice1.

1230	 2012	a	Mike Cassese/ReutersWilliam A. Ackman is playing corporate matchmaker.The hedge fund manager reiterated on Monday his position that General Growth Properties, a Chicago-based mall operator, should consider selling itself. Shareholders would benefit if the company were combined with the Simon Property Group, Mr. Ackman said at the Value Investing Congress in Midtown Manhattan.“I think this thing is ripe for the public to take a very hard look at,” he said.Mr. Ackman, whose fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, is a major investor in General Growth, has pushed for changes during its bankruptcy. He said on Monday that an announced deal could send the company’s stock price to around $29 a share by the end of the year. The stock, which closed Monday just above $19, rose in after-hours trading as Mr. Ackman spoke.General Growth’s stock price shot upward in August after Mr. Ackman revealed his merger proposal, but it then fell in September after the company said it would remain independent.As for the Simon Property Group, it has offered to buy General Growth in the past, but the chief financial officer recently said the company was not interested in a deal.Still, Mr. Ackman said he was “quite confident” that Simon would make a bid.“We don’t usually push for sales of companies,” Mr. Ackman said on Monday.Complicating matters is Brookfield Asset Management, which is steadily increasing its own stake in General Growth, Mr. Ackman said. He criticized Brookfield, at one point highlighting a letter in which the chief executive compared the company’s investing style to that of Warren E. Buffett‘s Berkshire Hathaway.“I know Berkshire Hathaway, and Brookfield is no Berkshire Hathaway,” Mr. Ackman said, to laughter from the audience.During the question-and-answer session, Mr. Ackman discussed his other well-known investments in J.C. Penney and Procter & Gamble. He also said he had a new short-selling idea, which he said he might decide to reveal in the future.“Shorts are even more fun than longs,” he said.
3870	 1997	a	PRONUNCIATION of the name notwithstanding, what George Young most needs this season is for his rookie head coach to be facile while Dan Reeves, if not Bill Parcells, proves himself the fossil. Yesterday was a pretty good start, as Reeves lost his debut with Atlanta, while Jim Fassel had a bucket of Gatorade dumped on him, a game ball handed to him and ''Happy Birthday'' sung to him.Fassel was 48 years young yesterday, but it was the Giants' general manager who had to be feeling spritely, as the Giants defeated Philadelphia, 31-17, at their home stadium, which by late last night had not yet been renamed for Parcells's Jets.With Parcells reigning in Seattle, with the Giants beginning their lives as the unofficial Other Team in Town, it was almost imperative that the Young/Fassel era not begin like one of the many balls Dave Brown wobbled through the Meadowlands currents the last three years. The Giants flirted briefly with fourth-quarter disaster, but after the interception and 95-yard touchdown return by the rookie strong safety Sam Garnes, the first step in the emotional distancing from Reeves was taken.''We want less historians and more pioneers around here,'' Fassel announced afterward, sounding the call for severance from the past.

3605	 1998	a	To the Editor:It's depressing to learn that young editors at our top publishers are thinking like the trash tabloids (Buzz: ''Fantasies of Monica Lewinsky: The Book,'' Feb. 8). These people will soon be deciding which books get published and which will not make it. On what grounds?Not long ago, book publishing attracted graduates who were educated enough to find and promote fine authors and exciting ideas. They were willing to work for less than they could make elsewhere because they had a vision of publishing's importance to society.The Radcliffe Publishing Course graduates would surely smile at such notions as dinosaur behavior that vanished along with standards of quality and integrity. Today, as one said: ''There has to be dirt, or forget it. No dirt, no cash.''SUZANNE KISTLERKips Bay

2859	 2003	a	How we spend our money now is very different from the spending patterns back in 1949, the last time personal consumption expenditures accounted for as large a share of the economy as they do now.The charts below show how much of each $1,000 in personal consumption spending goes for various things. In 1949, $700 went for the most basic of life's necessities: food, clothing and housing. Now the figure for those three categories is down to $458.That decline has been a steady one, freeing up more money for a myriad of other things. The figure fell below $600 in 1971 and went under $500 in 1993. The last year the figure rose was 1974, when the economy was in the worst recession since the Great Depression. Since then there have been four recessions, but they have not been so severe that consumers cut back enough on other things to push up the proportion of consumer spending devoted to the three necessities.Of those three, housing is the only one that has come close to maintaining its share of the American pocketbook. But that statistic is deceiving, because Americans expect a lot more now when buying houses, whether it is the number of bathrooms and bedrooms, or the things that are purchased to keep the household running. We get a lot more housing than we used to, even while spending about the same proportion of our available money.The charts below are on widely varying scales; the objective is not to compare different categories of spending but to show how the share of consumer spending devoted to each category has grown bigger or smaller. A declining line may not mean less is being spent on an item; it could indicate that spending in that category is growing at a slower rate than overall spending is rising.

30	 2019	a	In fact, in some Native American nations, like the six Iroquois, the elder matriarch is responsible for appointing the chief, holding him to certain standards and removing him if he fails to measure up, Wagner said.______MYTH: Contraception is a modern convention.REALITY: Condoms, diaphragms and the sponge have been around since the 1800s.The birth control pill may have not come on the market until 1960, but a variety of effective contraception methods were available to both women and men in the United States well before 1850, Wagner said.It was the Comstock Act, passed in 1873, that changed everything — allowing Anthony Comstock, a conservative Christian who proposed the legislation, to determine what was considered “obscene” in the country. “He decided that anything to do with sex or reproduction was obscene,” Wagner said.As a result, hundreds of people were arrested and imprisoned under the Comstock Act for distributing or possessing contraception, or publishing information about it. The activist Ida Craddock was among them, arrested for distributing such information. She took her own life shortly before her sentencing, which she believed would be life imprisonment.In her suicide note, she wrote: “I earnestly hope that the American public will awaken to a sense of the danger which threatens it from Comstockism.”______MYTH: Feminists burned bras.REALITY: No bras were burned! Seriously.The myth emerged on a hot summer day in 1969, when feminists gathered on the boardwalk of the Miss America Pageant in Atlantic City, N.J., to protest the competition.
3317	 2000	a	A committee of the Arkansas Supreme Court filed suit in Little Rock today asking a state court to enforce its recommendation that President Clinton be stripped of his law license for falsely denying under oath that he had a sexual relationship with Monica S.

Kendall, a Washington lawyer who is representing Mr. Clinton in the Arkansas case, said tonight, ''We fundamentally disagree with the complaint filed today and will defend vigorously against it.''

2881	 2002	a	Note: This lesson was originally published on an older version of The Learning Network; the link to the related Times article will take you to a page on the old site.Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students will explore the issue of race in television since the 1950’s, focusing specifically on African-American entertainers. After researching important issues, events, and television personalities of specific decades, students create “TV Guide” issues commemorating the “African-American experience” in television in those time periods.Author(s):Rachel McClain, The New York Times Learning NetworkJavaid Khan, The Bank Street College of Education in New York CitySuggested Time Allowance: 45 minutesObjectives:Students will:1. Consider the role of race in their favorite television shows; discuss issues of race in television.2. Explore how the African-American experience on television has changed over the course of television history by reading and discussing the article “An Evolving Vision In Black and White.”3. Investigate different decades in television in terms of racial trends.4. Develop special commemorative issues of television guides that focus on the racial issues of different decade in television history.Resources / Materials:-student journals-pens/pencils-paper-classroom board-copies of the article “An Evolving Vision In Black and White” (one per student)-research materials with information about African-Americans on television (computers with Internet access, media studies references, television references, etc.)Activities / Procedures:NOTE TO TEACHER: This lesson focuses on the representation of African-Americans on television. However, the lesson can be expanded to also include the inclusion and portrayal of other races.1. WARM-UP/DO NOW: In their journals, students respond to the following prompt (written on the board prior to class): “List your five favorite television shows, skipping a few lines between each. What races are represented in the show, and to what extent (e.g. main characters, recurring characters, etc.)? What role do you think the characters’ races play on each of these shows?” After a few minutes, conduct a class discussion on the results of student journals, using the following questions as a guide: What racial patterns do students see among these shows? What do they think would account for these patterns? Do you think that the prevalence of African-Americans and other races in television is the same? Why or why not?2. As a class, read and discuss the article “An Evolving Vision In Black and White,” focusing on the following questions:a. What was “remarkable” about the three men on the cover of last week’s “Newsweek” magazine?b. What gesture of Eddie Cantor’s caused a wave of hate mail?c. According to the article, how have racial barriers changed throughout television history?d. What is the status of African-American dramas on television today?e. According to Donald Bogle, what aspect of African-American television personalities has remained consistent throughout television history?f. What opinions about “Amos n’ Andy” are cited in the article?g. What is the author of the article’s overall opinion of the TV Land special? How do you know?h. What are the main topics addressed in “The Heroes of Black Comedy”?i. What “breakthroughs” in the roles of African-Americans on television are cited in the article?3. Divide students into six groups, and assign each group a decade in television history from the 1950’s to today (alternately, create five groups and include the years 2000-2002 in the group focusing on the 1990’s). Each group is charged with creating a special commemorative “decade” issue of a television guide, focusing on the African-American presence in television in that decade. Using all available resources, students respond to the following questions (written on the board for easier student reference):–In general, what was the African-American presence in television like during this decade? How were African-Americans represented in comedy, drama and other television genres?–How would you describe the social and political positions of African-Americans in the United States in this decade? How was this mirrored in their presence on television?–What “breakthroughs” occurred in this decade with regards to African-Americans on television, and who led them? What was public opinion regarding these breakthroughs?–What were the most popular shows with mostly or all African-American casts or cast members? How were the characters portrayed? What were some of the common themes of these shows?4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Once research is complete, each group develops a television guide representing African-Americans in television in their assigned decade. Guides should include items such as typical listings of shows for various dates throughout the decade, special feature articles, a “Cheers and Jeers” section reflecting general attitudes about the African-American presence in television in this decade, and any other features they wish to include. In a later class, groups should present their television guides to the class.Further Questions for Discussion:–What stereotypes, about African-Americans or any other racial group, do you see perpetuated on television? Do you think that television should be “stereotype-free”? Why or why not?–How do you think the perception of African-Americans in the mass media has changed in the past 50 years?–Do you think an all-African-American television drama could be successful? Why or why not?Evaluation / Assessment:Students will be evaluated based on initial journal response, participation in class discussions and group research, and thoughtful and well-developed television guide issues.Vocabulary:moguls, instigated, dichotomy, clunky, populist, dynamic, bugaboos, shtick, provocative, encyclopedic, poignancy, triviality, skewering, jaunty, mundane, debonair, sanctioningExtension Activities:1. Research the life of a famous African-American actor. Write a biography about this person, answering the following questions: How did he or she become an entertainer? To what extent was or is race an issue in this person’s life and career? For what is this entertainer most famous? Include pictures and quotations where possible.2. Keep a log of the television shows you watch during one week, taking note of the racial presence. Try to watch several different channels at different times and note any differences in the racial make-up of the shows, as well as the type of shows (comedy, drama, miniseries, etc.). Also note the racial make-up of the commercials aired. Do they mirror the make-up of the shows during which they air? Write an assessment of your findings.3. Give a musical presentation to your class based on the life and career of an African-American musician. Include both biographical information and a presentation of music representative of this musician. You can bring in a recording, or, if possible, learn to play a piece of this person’s music yourself.4. Create a special series of products, such as cereal boxes or stamps, for Black History Month, commemorating current African-American leaders. Select different leaders in politics, sports, music, film, television, and other areas of public life, and highlight their achievements.5. Watch a re-run on television of one of the predominantly African-American cast shows cited in the article, such as “The Jeffersons,” “The Cosby Show” and “Sanford and Sons.” Write a review of the show by answering the following questions: Who are the characters in this show, and what are they like? What issues are presented on the show, and how are they addressed? How does race play a role in how these issues are addressed? Are there any racial stereotypes presented, and if so, what are they and how are they presented? How was this show revolutionary? Do you think this show would be popular today? Why or why not?6. Stage a debate in your classroom about a racially-based current events issue, such as affirmative action or racially or socially driven college admissions policies.Interdisciplinary Connections:Health- Research genetic diseases that are strongly linked to specific races, such as sickle cell anemia (African-Americans) or Tay-Sachs (European Jews). Create a pamphlet describing several such diseases, explaining why they are commonly found among certain racial populations and offering resources for people who want to know more about them (Web sites, organizations, hotlines, etc.)Journalism- Interview people in your school and community on race in the United States today. You may want to ask general questions about issues of race, or focus on a specific topic, such as blacks in television or interracial dating. Make sure to interview people or different ages (especially people who lived through the civil rights movement and may be able to offer insights into the changes that have taken place since the 1960’s), races and walks of life. Write a feature article for your school newspaper on your findings.Science- Research several famous African-American scientists. Create a series of posters with profiles of these scientists, including pictures, biographical information, and information about famous discoveries, awards won and other honors received.Teaching with The Times- Visit The Learning Network’s “How Race is Lived in America” special feature (//www.nytimes.com/learning/race).

5909	 1983	a	The fragmentation of poor black families is an undeniable and unhappy fact of life that burdens all society. For years, however, black leaders resisted direct efforts to help the black family by arguing that the real issue was racism.That seems to be changing, especially as pregnancy among unwed minority teen-agers increases alarmingly. ''Repair of the black family is central to any serious strategy to improve the black condition,'' says Eleanor Holmes Norton, former head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.The National Urban League now supports local programs to reduce teen-age pregnancies. And a group of black scholars and civil rights leaders urges that Government redesign welfare programs so that they lead poor families toward economic independence.Just how that might be done is far from obvious - and would be a worthy topic for debate in the 1984 campaign. But one model set up by the Manpower Development Research Corporation and supported by the Labor Department and Ford Foundation is worth a close look.

5595	 1986	a	Conflicts between American Indians and the Federal Government are nothing new, but the contest that once raged on Western battlefields has now moved to the bingo parlor and, most recently, to Congress as well.Encouraged by the Reagan Administration, Indian tribes in several states have established high-stakes bingo parlors, which, because they are on land held in trust for the Indian nations by the Government, are exempt from many state regulations.According to Carl F. Shaw, a spokesman for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Administration has supported the bingo operations because they fit in with President Reagan's desire to see Indian tribes become more self-sufficient as Federal money becomes less plentiful. Objections by the StatesBut many states say the bingo parlors are driving rival fund-raising operations run by church groups and veterans' organizations out of business by offering higher stakes than state regulations would allow. Others complain that those stakes, which can exceed $100,000, will draw organized crime into the tribes' affairs. And some say they fear that the tribes will eventually get into casinos, horse racing, lotteries and other such high-stakes gambling operations.

4305	 1994	a	To the Sports Editor:If the Masters organizing committee thinks that one more sponsor and 12 more minutes of commercials per hour is not the way to go, then rather than attacking the committee for not showing the front nine, Anderson should be praising its sense of maintaining the integrity of the telecast. The committee is right. There is nothing more exciting than the last nine holes of the Masters. DEMETRIOS G. XISTRIS Larchmont, N.Y.

6426	 1970	a	Atter its sharp decline on Thursday, the world sugar futures market regained a little equlibrium yesterday. Trading slowed from a near record 6,344 contracts to 1,400 contracts.The sharp drop on Thursday followed reliable reports of better than expected supply situation. Yesterday, at the opening of trading, there was some further liquidation of sugar contracts by speculators, probably due to some margin calls after Thursday's debacle.As one broker commented, the selling may have been overdone because trade buying entered to steady the market and push prices ahead for the day.The busy September delivery, which declined from 3.83 cents a pound to 3.70 cents on Thursday, pushed ahead to close at a range of 3.74 cents to 3.75 cents yesterday. The world spot price remained unchanged yesterday at 3.75 cents.

4550	 1993	a	West Virginia's plan to decline a New Year's Day Cotton Bowl invitation and accept a bid from the more lucrative Sugar Bowl may yet encounter some resistance. Troy Mathieu, executive director of the Sugar Bowl, said yesterday that his game would consider selecting once-beaten Notre Dame over the undefeated Mountaineers if the final regular-season polls next Sunday give his game a choice before the Cotton Bowl gets to select.That possibility is remote because Florida would have to defeat Alabama in the Southeastern Conference championship game on Saturday by a margin wide enough -- and convincing enough to voters -- to overcome a three-place, 373-point deficit to Texas A&M in the combined polls used in the bowl selection process.Texas A&M, the Southwest Conference champion and host team in the Cotton Bowl, is in seventh place with 2,385 points in the combined total of the Associated Press media poll and the CNN/USA Today poll of coaches. Florida is 10th with 2,012 points. In the likely event that A&M remains ahead of Florida in the combined polls next Sunday, the Cotton Bowl would have the second choice, after the Orange Bowl invites second-ranked Florida State to meet No. 1 Nebraska."If we have the opportunity, I don't think it's any secret that the Cotton Bowl this year would like to invite the highest-rated team to play Texas A&M," said Rick Baker, the game's executive director. Based on the combined poll this week, that team should be third-place West Virginia.
502	 2016	a	Mexico City — Mexico’s president, Enrique Peña Nieto, had already had a terrible summer. July was the most murderous month in Mexico since he took office in 2012. Second-quarter results showed negative economic growth for the first time in three years. A survey found his approval rating slipping to 23 percent. And a news report even alleged that he plagiarized nearly a third of his law degree thesis. How could he make it any worse? Only by inviting Donald J. Trump, one of the most hated men in Mexico — so hated that piñatas with his visage are brisk sellers across the country — to his presidential palace.The curious thing about Mr. Peña Nieto’s latest debacle is how, unlike his other woes, it was totally self-inflicted. There is little tradition of sitting Mexican leaders meeting with American presidential hopefuls, so he was under no pressure to arrange the get-together. And it couldn’t have come at a worse time: the very day of Mr. Trump’s hard-hitting immigration speech, and the day before Mr. Peña Nieto’s state of the union address. Mr. Peña Nieto had even compared Mr. Trump to Hitler.But in a stupefying decision, last week he sent invitations out to the Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump to come to Mexico, and then conceded, reportedly under pressure from the Trump team, to meet its candidate first, on the fateful Aug. 31.

1585	 2010	a	For Republican candidates, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, is a favorite target these days — the San Francisco liberal and leader of the Democratic incumbents that the insurgent, resurgent G.O.P. challengers want to oust. But as vilified as she may be at times, Ms. Pelosi is planning an aggressive itinerary to raise money for individual Democratic candidates and for her party as whole in the closing weeks of the campaign.This weekend, Ms. Pelosi will speak at fundraisers for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in New York and Los Angeles, according to her office. She will then attend committee fund-raising dinners with President Obama on Oct. 11 in Coral Gables, Fla., and on Oct. 23 in Minneapolis, and another with the first lady, Michelle Obama, in San Francisco on Oct. 25.In addition, she will visit a local manufacturer in San Francisco on Wednesday to talk about the Democrats’ “Make it in America” agenda, and she will address the United Steel Workers’ “Women of Steel” conference in Pittsburgh on Oct. 18. All in all, the news bulletin said, Ms. Pelosi will visit eight states for 25 fund-raising events with 21 Democratic lawmakers between now and the Nov. 2 election.Ms. Pelosi’s office said it was not releasing details about her other destinations, in keeping with longstanding security procedures and noting that other events could be added to her schedule. But given that five of the eight states are New York, California, Florida, Pennsylvania and Minnesota, it seemed likely that Ms. Pelosi would be making repeat visits to Democratic strongholds and steer clear of regions where she could cause political problems for Democratic candidates.

4158	 1995	a	Glenn Burke, a former outfielder for the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Oakland Athletics who was the first major league baseball player to publicly acknowledge his homosexuality, died Tuesday at Fairmont Hospital in San Leandro, Calif. He was 42.The cause was complications from AIDS, said Pamela Pitts, the A's director of baseball administration.Burke played in the majors for four and a half seasons, batting .237 and stealing 35 bases. But he left the game at the age of 27 in 1980 because, he said, too many people in baseball condemned his sexuality. "Prejudice drove me out of baseball sooner than I should have," Burke said in an interview with The New York Times last year. "But I wasn't changing."He was hospitalized early last year when it was determined that he had AIDS.In 1987, his right leg and foot were shattered when he was hit by a car in San Francisco.

5315	 1988	a	The Environment Yesterday in Michigan, George Bush started to talk about something serious. Diversions about the Pledge of Allegiance or Mr. Dukakis's alleged lack of patriotism were laid aside. Mr. Bush addressed the mounting evidence of deterioration in the environment and promised to convene a global conference to discuss remedies. That's a welcome beginning to debate on a strangely neglected issue.This has been a miserable summer. People gag on ozone smog as bad as in any year on record. They can't escape the heat by visiting the seashore because the beaches are polluted. They hear warnings that even hotter years lie ahead because of the global warming caused by the predicted greenhouse effect. All the stranger that until now, neither candidate has made concern about the state of the environment a major issue.At his acceptance speech in Atlanta, Mr. Dukakis devoted a single sentence to the environment, saying he would rather protect it than polluters. Mr. Bush, in New Orleans, promised to stop ocean dumping, ''reduce the harm'' done by acid rain and have the F.B.I. nab discarders of medical waste.Unfortunately the new environmental problems are more serious and more complex than the old ones. The threat to the life-protecting ozone layer in the stratosphere requires international agreement to stop manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons. There's already a pact to cap production of the chemicals, but further vigorous efforts by the U.S. are needed to prepare countries for the next step -phasing the chemicals out altogether.

5286	 1988	a	To the Editor:American consumers now pay more than twice what they should for sugar! But Senator Daniel K. Inouye has sponsored a provision in the 1989 appropriations bill for agriculture that would further subsidize a few large sugar refiners under the guise of helping the Caribbean Basin Initiative countries and the Philippines.United States sugar refiners would purchase raw sugar at the domestic price (again, more than two times higher than the world price) from Caribbean Basin producers and the Philippines. Domestic refiners would refine and export the sugar to the world market at the substantially lower world price. The taxpayer would then compensate domestic refiners for the difference.This is a business subsidy in its worst form because the domestic sugar program, which artificially props up prices by virtually precluding sugar imports from other countries, already costs the United States consumer nearly $3 billion a year!And this sugar export enchancement program would cost taxpayers $140 million more a year, with the subsidy going to about 10 major refiners.

Only Pennsylvania had a higher number of parolees per 100,000 adults at the end of 1995.In 1994, New Jersey ranked third behind Pennsylvania and Texas. But last year, the state's paroled population grew by 13.4 percent to 47,411. Mario Paparozzi, assistant chief of the New Jersey Bureau of Parole, said that prison overcrowding was putting pressure on state corrections officials to release inmates who qualify for parole.

1317	 2011	a	ATHENS — Outside of the N.B.A., the Euroleague is the best basketball in the world. For Ricky Rubio to lead a team of F.C. Barcelona’s caliber, at age 20, is a tremendous accomplishment. But he may have learned all he can by playing professionally in Spain, and if basketball is his first priority, it’s time to come to the N.B.A.Hrvoje Polan/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesThat is not to say that Rubio, who was selected fifth in the 2009draft by the Timberwolves, has not improved in Spain. The professional polish shows in his game. He has acquired a skill set that would be hard to develop in the A.A.U.-dominated American development system. He’s a pass-first guy. He’s polished coming off the pick and roll. His awareness of help defense and defensive schemes is extremely advanced.All of these skills were on display when F.C. Barcelona, last season’s champion, was eliminated from the Euroleague playoffs, with a 78-67 loss against Panathinaikos B.C. on Thursday. In smoky and packed Olympic Stadium, Rubio was asked to fill a variety of roles. He chased the former University of Maryland star Drew Nicholas around screens as if he were Reggie Miller. He denied the Panathinaikos linchpin Dimitris Diamantidis and often kept him from even catching the ball. On offense he initiated Barcelona’s sets, made quick outlets, and fed the post smoothly and seemingly without effort.None of this is to say that Rubio had a good basketball game. In 29 minutes, he shot 1-of-5 from the field, with 3 points, 3 assists and 3 turnovers. He found himself on the bench for most of the last three minutes.Worse than a poor individual performance, Rubio appears to have settled into a role that emphasizes his weaknesses. He was doing everything his coaches were asking of him; they just weren’t asking very much. The role of a point guard for Barcelona is to initiate the offense and run the pick and roll. Gone was the open court vision for which Rubio is known. Barcelona rarely looked to push the ball, and when it did, Panathinaikos simply took a non-shooting foul to slow down the pace.Make no mistake about it, Rubio has trouble scoring. He can’t shoot and he doesn’t even look to score around the basket. But he’s a tremendously gifted passer. That was evident even with the shackles Barcelona had on him. His skip passes against Panathinaikos’ pack-the-paint defense were quick and in the shooter’s pocket. He knew when he wanted to get the ball into the post and where his teammates liked to catch it. He got the ball out and up the court easily, blessed with that gift of just knowing where his teammates are, rather than having to look for them.In the Euroleague, playing at a snails pace and surrounded by average athleticism, Rubio’s inability to score is more important than his ability to set up his teammates. It’s why Barcelona had him sitting at the conclusion of its season-ending loss. He’s an offensive liability. Worse still, he does not even have to make plays. He can just initiate the offense in the half-court, often never to see the ball again in a possession. He can’t learn that way.It’s easy to see how his game would be different in the N.B.A. If the ball was in his hands on the fast break, or longer in the half court, he would have to finish plays, not initiate them. At first this might mean assists to gifted teammates, but teams would adjust and it would ultimately require learning how to score. He is not getting that opportunity to develop within the Barcelona’s system.For those looking for an American comparison, it’s best to forget Pete Maravich or Steve Nash. Rubio will never be a legendary scorer like Maravich, or a drop-dead shooter like Nash. The better comparison is Celtics guard Rajon Rondo. Like Rondo, Rubio is at his best in the open floor, when his lack of shooting does not clutter the floor. They both excel when surrounded by scorers. Both have a talent for getting rebounds and steals, and neither needs to score to be effective. Rubio is not blessed with the quickness of Rondo, but his court sense and anticipation on the defensive end have made him a top-notch defender in Europe.The strongest part of this comparison is how much better suited Rondo was for the N.B.A. than for college basketball. Like Rondo after his freshman year at Kentucky, Rubio is seeing his stock drop because he is playing in a system that does not exploit his gifts. He will thrive in the more wide-open N.B.A. game, where there are not always three defenders sitting in the paint. Like Rondo at Kentucky, Rubio has learned all he can from a cluttered style of basketball and is being held back by it. Some players are just meant to play with the best players in the best league in the world. Rubio is one of them.Stephen Danley played basketball at Penn from 2003 to 2007.

2993	 2002	a	The crew had more than 20 lifeguards at its height. It was made up of young men from the Bronx and Harlem. They met while swimming for the Porpoise Club swim team, which was run by the Parks Department out of St. Mary's Recreation Center in the South Bronx.The founder of the crew was the coach of the club, a former Coast Guard officer named Charles Smith. Mr. Smith, universally known as Pops or Smitty, was the chief lifeguard at Riis Park from 1952 to 1964. Every summer, he took his swimmers out to work at the beach. ''It was the turning point in all our lives,'' said Mr. Ninons, 61 and a retired accountant. ''He was like a father to us. Some of us had fathers, but some of us didn't. He made us into men.''Mr. Smith died of cancer last year, but he lives on in the stories his lifeguards tell today.He was something of a discipline freak, said Mr. Gales, and used to make his men arrange the trash cans on the beach until they formed a perfect a line. His training workouts were apparently brutal. On rainy days when the beach was empty, he had his lifeguards run a half mile down the beach then swim back to the starting point. Run, swim. Run, swim.''I hated rainy days,'' said Mr. Gales, 62.Back then, the beaches (known as bays) were fairly segregated, not by law but by choice. Bays 3, 4 and 5 were predominantly black and were run by Smitty's Crew. It always seemed that some fraternity brothers from Howard University had come up on vacation. The basketball court behind Bay 5 was known for its rough-and-tumble pick-up game.The whites -- mainly Irish and Italians -- occupied the beaches from Bay 6 south. Bay 1 was the gay beach. The serious beer drinkers went to Bay 13. Still, there was frequent mixing and hardly any problems for the lifeguards with their orange uniforms and orange buoys. ''It was never a color thing,'' said Mr. Ninons. ''We didn't see black or white. Orange was the only color we knew.''

6300	 1971	a	George Blanda of the Oak land Raiders has been named the American Football Con ference's most valuable play er by the Long Island Ath letic Club and will be hon ored at the club's dinner, on Friday, Jan. 29, at the Garden City (L.I.) Hotel.The 43‐year‐old Blanda, subbing for the injured Daryle Lamonica on Oct. 25, threw three touchdown pass es and kicked a field goal as Oakland beat Pittsburgh, 31 14. A week later, his 48‐yard field goal with three seconds left gave the Raiders a 17‐17 tie with Kansas City.On Nov. 8, he passed to Warren Wells for a touch down with 90 seconds re maining to tie the game and kicked a field goal with three seconds to go to beat Cleve land 23‐20. A week later he threw a 20‐yard touchdown pass to Fred Biletnikoff with 2:28 left to defeat Denver, 24‐19. He capped his string with a 16‐yard field goal with seven seconds to go that gave the Raiders a 20‐17 victory over San Diego.
6381	 1970	a	The 7 per cent rise from 1969 to 1970 falls far short of the 26 per cent increase from 1968 to 1969. High in terest rates, and skyrocketing building costs have been factor in keeping down ex penditures for all commercial enterprizes.While this indicates a sub stantial rise in capital in vestment, it falls short of the 10 per cent rise predicted for all business, and there can be no doubt that high interest rates, and skyrocket ing building costs have been a factor in keeping down expenditures for commercial enterprises.If the large retail syndi cates are going to expand building new stores rather than by purchasing existing smaller companies. Opposi tion from the Justice De partment to some of the retail mergers in recent years has given pause to the idea of growth by acquisi tion.Last week, Hart, Schaffner & Marx, a men's clothing manufacturer agreed to dis pose of 30 of its retail cloth ing stores that it had ac quired since Jan. 1, 1968. The agreement followed a suit filed by the Department of Justice to force the cloth ing company to dispose of 71 stores, and is reminiscent of the agreement of Spartans Industries a few years ago to sell the Spartans Atlantic group of department stores when the company toik over the Korvette chain.•In the Hart, Schaffner & Marx case, as in the Spar tans case, the principle of dual distribution was in volved. Under dual distribu tion, a manufacturer sells to other retailers and to com pany‐owned stores, some times to the disadvantage of the outsider.The question now is whether some equity has been established for the in dependent owner who is forced into competition with his suppliers they will have to do it byAs long as no provision is made for the prevention of the establishment of new outlets that are close to those of independent cus tomers, there is little chance of reducing the chance of unfair competition. In the Hart, Schaffner & Marx case, the disposal of 30 stores will have no bearing on the com pany's expansion program.

2534	 2004	a	To the Editor:Bernard Holland had it almost right in his insightful essay. Education is indeed the key, but learning is not primarily a matter of being told about music or musicians. It is not necessarily about being able to analyze music, and it is not even about hearing music (although that is a given). In the very first instance, learning is about making music, at whatever level one is able to achieve. Doing it yourself in music (or any of the arts) is equivalent to taking a turn at bat, fielding a ball or swimming a lap.GEORGE STURMEnglewood, N.J.

41	 2019	a	In 1985, Michael J. Fox was one of the biggest stars in the world: “Back to the Future” and “Teen Wolf” occupied the top two spots at the box office, and “Family Ties,” the long-running sitcom on which he played Alex P. Keaton, was at its peak. “I wanted to be a rock star,” Fox told David Marchese in this week’s Talk interview. “That’s what I thought being famous was. But I wasn’t a rock star. I was kind of an idiot. I missed the point.” Six years later, Fox found out he had Parkinson’s disease, which he credits with getting him on track. Fox still acts occasionally — later roles include those on “Scrubs” and “Boston Legal” — but has dedicated his life to advocating a cure for Parkinson’s. Fox and Marchese talked about acting with Parkinson’s, taking the wrong roles and staying positive: “Until it’s not funny anymore, it is funny.”[Read our full interview with Michael J. Fox.]He still believes in a cure for Parkinson’s.His foundation, which has raised $800 million to combat the disease, has a working relationship with the government. (Still, Fox found himself upset when President Trump appeared to mock Serge Kovaleski, a reporter for The New York Times who has the joint condition arthrogryposis. But he didn’t feel the need to say anything in response: “People already know Trump is an [expletive].”) He’s still hopeful for a cure. In the interim, he’s optimistic about a new drug that acts like a rescue inhaler when people freeze, but knows that prophylactics are not a cure — but they’re better than nothing.He worried about presenting a “false hope” about his diagnosis.“I’d made peace with the disease but presumed others had that same relationship when they didn’t,” he told Marchese. But then his experience got worse: He found himself in a position where he couldn’t walk and had round-the-clock aides, and was unsure if he could still keep up his hopeful disposition. He’s working on a new book about wading through all this.His response to the diagnosis was to make a number of comedic films: “For Love or Money,” “Life With Mikey” and “Greedy,” which were critical and commercial flops.

4932	 1990	a	AS Communism recedes, longstanding ethnic rivalries remain to haunt Eastern Europe. The region is dotted with minorities, from the tiny population of Sorbs, a Slavic people, in East Germany to the Turks who make up 10 percent of the population of Bulgaria. Old hostilities are still being played out, like the rivalry of Hungarians and Romanians for ownership of Transylvania. In some cases, however, efforts are being made to heal old wounds, as President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia recently tried to do with conciliatory statements about the expulsion after World War II of 3.25 million ethnic Germans from the Sudetenland. Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia have never been homogeneous nations at all; rather, they are combinations of distinct groups trying to share the same country. In Czechoslovakia, ethnic differences were played down during the four decades of cold war, but in Bulgaria and Romania the rigid Communist regimes suppressed ethnic minorities as official policy. Now, with the lid lifted in Eastern Europe, the ancient divisions are being given free expression and have become more evident than at any time since World War II. The re-emergence poses a challenge for the post-Communist republics: Can they accommodate the rivalries, keep the peace and build democracy?POLANDIn Poland there is fear that a unified Germany could one day revive a claim to former German lands. Poles were unsettled when Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany hesitated about committing to the permanence of current borders. Germans expelled from Poland after World War II and their descendants are a vocal lobby in West Germany; the number of ethnic Germans on Polish land is uncertain.CZECHOSLOVAKIACzechoslovakia was created after World War I as a homeland for Czechs and Slovaks, minorities in the Austro-Hungarian empire. Today the Slovaks retain fears of domination by the Czechs, who outnumber them 2 to 1 in the population of 15.5 million and inhabit the western provinces, Bohemia and Moravia. In the post-Communist order, the Slovaks seek a federation; Czechs favor a more centralized republic.YUGOSLAVIAThe people who live within the borders of Yugoslavia agree on one thing: it is hard to find a Yugoslavian. They are Serbian, Croatian, Montenegrin, Macedonian, Bosnian, Slovenian or ethnic Albanian, and the mix is not happy. The unity achieved by Tito after World War II is under more and more strain, related to the efforts of Serbs, the oldest and largest group, to expand their role. Dozens of people have died this year in Kosovo, a province where ethnic Albanians have protested a Serbian effort to assert control; anger is also rising in Macedonia, Croatia and Slovenia.

2651	 2004	a	On our way to a screening of "Shark Tale," my daughter and I fell into a discussion of "Finding Nemo," a movie she has seen several dozen times. The subject came up naturally enough, since the movie we were about to see, which opens nationwide today, is DreamWorks's attempt to follow Disney and Pixar into the lucrative and technologically demanding world of underwater computer-generated 3-D animation. In anticipation of the novel delights of "Shark Tale," my daughter was happy to revise her earlier high opinion of "Nemo." "It's about a fish who gets lost," she said with a shrug. "That's not really very interesting."As if on guard against such jadedness, the makers of "Shark Tale" have ensured that their movie is about as many things as possible, including a fish who gets lost, though not quite in the way that Nemo did. The busy story, in any case, with its predictable messages -- Be who you are! Don't forget where you came from! Fish are friends, not food! -- is secondary to the packaging, a bright, hectic swirl of easy jokes and accessible pop-culture allusions.There are cheerful quasi-ethnic stereotypes -- jellyfish Rastafarians, shark Mafiosi, aquatic ghetto kids with cans of spray paint -- that are technically insulated against offensiveness because, well, they're all fish. There are movie-star voices galore -- Robert De Niro, Will Smith, Renée Zellweger, Jack Black, Angelina Jolie -- and even, more unusually, a recognizable movie-director voice and caricature. I'm relieved (and maybe just a tiny bit disappointed) to report that when Sykes, a fast-talking blowfish with bushy eyebrows, appeared on screen, my daughter, who is 5, did not lean over and whisper, "Hey, isn't that Martin Scorsese?"But of course Mr. Scorsese was not there for her benefit. Like the "Shrek" pictures, also from DreamWorks, "Shark Tale" lobs a barrage of movie and television references over the heads of the children in the audience and into the faces of their parents. Some of these are visual, like Sykes's resemblance to the auteur reading his lines, while others pop up on the soundtrack, which quotes the scores from "The Godfather," "Car Wash" and, of course, "Jaws." For the finale, fishy likenesses of Christina Aguilera and Missy Elliott strut and prance while the real-life divas sing us through the closing credits.
5508	 1987	a	Scott Turow, the author of the best-selling novel ''Presumed Innocent,'' has been strongly chastised by a Federal appeals court for his actions as an Assistant United States Attorney in Chicago in the early 1980's.In a ruling dated Nov. 16 and stamped ''Do Not Publish,'' a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, found that Mr. Turow may have obstructed justice by using a criminal defense lawyer as an informant against his own client. At the end of the 13-page ruling, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, the judges ordered the case sent to the United States Attorney in Miami for possible action.Ana T. Barnett, the Chief Assistant United States Attorney in Miami, said the Office of Public Integrity of the Department of Justice had been asked to review the case.Mr. Turow, whose novel deals with a Midwest prosecutor who is falsely accused of murder, criticized the opinion of the appellate court as ''disgraceful and lacking legal or factual basis.'' Speaking from Chicago, where he is a lawyer with the firm of Sonnenschein Carlin Nath & Rosenthal, Mr. Turow said that he also had asked for a Justice Department review and that his actions had been approved by his superiors.

650	 2015	a	PhotoIs China one of the world’s most atheist countries?That’s the conclusion of a poll by WIN/Gallup International, released earlier this year, that surveyed more than 50,000 people from 57 countries. In China, 61 percent identified themselves as atheist and 29 percent as nonreligious; 7 percent said they were religious.That contrasts starkly with the rest of the world. Over all, just 11 percent of those surveyed said they were atheists; 22 percent said they were nonreligious, and 63 percent said they were religious. The only countries whose percentage of declared atheists came anywhere near China’s, according to the poll, were Japan, France and the Czech Republic, each with about 30 percent. No other country had more than 15 percent.Since its release in April, the poll has been widely reported in the global media, attracting attention in The Washington Post, The Daily Telegraph and The Huffington Post, as well as blogs predicting a rising atheist tide, primarily because of China’s huge number of reported atheists.But since then, experts have been wondering why the results contradict the situation that many researchers see on the ground. Travelers to China often note the growing number of temples, churches and mosques, while leading academics are almost unanimous in describing a religious rebirth.Ijaz Gilani, who heads global opinion research for WIN/Gallup, which is based in Switzerland, said he also wondered about the high response rate for atheism in China. At first, he said, he thought it might have to do with China being a post-communist state (or post-Maoist, at any rate). But then he noted that most post-communist states did not report high numbers of atheists.“This flummoxed me,” Mr. Gilani said. “But I began to notice that there was something going on in East Asia.” In Japan, 62 percent of respondents said they were either atheists or not religious; in South Korea, the figure was 56 percent, and in Hong Kong it was 70 percent.Yang Fenggang, who runs the Center on Religion and Chinese Society at Purdue University, believes the answers have to do with the question. The word for religion in Chinese, zongjiao, is a 19th-century term borrowed from the Japanese, who in turn translated the concept from German.In East Asia, religious beliefs and practices were long an organic part of daily life. Modern states separated religion into a separate sphere, and so needed a new word. As religion became a hotly contested subject in China in the 20th century, under the Nationalists and then the Communists, zongjiao became a narrow, highly politicized term that usually referred to formal organizations and structures.“‘Religion’ in China is a contested term,” Professor Yang said. “You have to look at how the questions are posed.”WIN/Gallup asked respondents in every country to characterize themselves as “a religious person,” “not a religious person” or “a convinced atheist,” with a fourth option of “do not know/no response.” In China, the first two options used the term xinyang zongjiao, literally “a person who believes in religion.”“Xinyang zongjiao is a very formal term,” Professor Yang said. “People may not respond the way the researchers intend.”Robert Weller, a professor of anthropology at Boston University, said xinyang zongjiao was probably understood to refer to formal members of one of China’s five officially recognized religions: Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Protestantism and Catholicism. Most Chinese practice an amalgam of Buddhism, Taoism and folk practices that is often described as “traditional belief” (chuantong xinyang) or simply “belief” (xinyang), avoiding the contentious term zongjiao.Another problem with the poll could be methodology, Dr. Weller said. In China, it was conducted online — a medium that increasingly is not anonymous here. “The ‘convinced atheist’ rate is probably so high because everyone knows it’s the official answer,” Dr. Weller said.Such possible problems mirror an issue that arose last year when Pew Research Center, in its Global Attitudes Project, found that most Chinese did not consider belief in God to be necessary for morality. The results for China were eventually excised from the final report.As Mr. Gilani notes, though, the WIN/Gallup poll has much value. It breaks down responses by age, education, and income levels. In China, the combined response rate for “convinced atheist” and “not a religious person” is only 56 percent among people age 30 and under, versus 90 percent for those 70 and older. This indicates that younger Chinese are more likely to reject the term “atheist,” which is still promoted by the Communist Party.“In other parts of the world, the survey is more uniformly understood,” Mr. Gilani said. “In East Asia, the signals are more complex, but it still gives some insight.”
3781	 1997	a	Dow Loses 47.33 Points; Technology Sector Is WeakAlan Greenspan spoke on Wednesday, and the bears are still listening. Since Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned of ''excessive optimism'' in the financial markets, the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen 160 points, or 2.3 percent. The slump continued yesterday, as the Dow fell 47.33 points, to close at 6,877.74. The technology sector -- in particular, shares of computer networking companies -- remained weak, and the Nasdaq composite index declined 3.66 points, to 1,309.For the week, the Nasdaq index was down nearly 2 percent. The Dow's loss for the week, however, was only 54 points after strong gains on Monday and Tuesday. $(Page 38.$)Treasury prices were little changed despite lingering worries that the Fed would soon raise short-term interest rates.

Other interested parties, notably Saks and Neiman Marcus, would not comment, but the creditors committee's first option is to see if either of them will raise the ante. $(36.$)

2147	 2007	a	Hillary Rodham Clinton got a reminder in Iowa today of just how divisive the issue of immigration is –- on both sides of the ideological spectrum. She drew a lusty chorus of boos from advocates of laws permitting illegal immigrants to become citizens as she spoke at the Heartland Forum, a Democratic presidential forum organized by a collection of community groups here.It happened as Mrs. Clinton was pressed on whether she was prepared, within the first 100 days of her presidency, to push through legislation that would give undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship. The question drew applause.“I have been in favor of a path to citizenship for years,” Mrs. Clinton said, according to a transcript provided by Radio Iowa. “I voted it in the Senate and, as president, comprehensive immigration reform will be a high priority for me.”She drew a scattering of applause but her questioner pressed Mrs. Clinton about whether she would do that in her first 100 days.“You’ve got to get the Congress to pass the legislation,” she said, talking over boos from one corner of the room. “The president can do as much as possible, which I will do.”

7441	 1964	a	AMSTERDAM, the Netherlands, April 30 (Comtelburo)—An agreement has been reached on the issuing of a $10 million loan by the Jutland Telephone Company, the Rotterdamsche Bank announced today. The 5¾ per cent 20‐year loan will be listed in London and Luxembourg.An international syndicate, which took over the loan, will offer a large part of the issue exclusively in Europe at 98¾ per cent.The loan will be redeemed in 1984 at the latest. Redemption will occur in 14 equal annual $666,000 installments in 1970– 1983 and a final $676,000 installment in 1984. The company will be allowed to redeem the loan completely or partially ahead of schedule in 1975–1979 inclusive under penalty clauses and in 1980 and afterward at par.
2183	 2006	a	Encyclopedia Hanasiana offer a very simple diagram that is funnier and smarter than anything the Bagger has said all season, which is not a very high bar, but still. We all know Philip Seymour Hoffman is a lock, but no one can articulate why. Jim Hanas explains it all with one little graphic and a bit of annotation:It used to be that to win an Oscar, you had to play someone handicapped. That all changed last year when playing famous proved to be Oscar gold, with Jamie Foxx and Cate Blanchett bagging statuettes for portraying Ray Charles and Katharine Hepburn, respectively. That trend continues—five of this year’s 20 actor nominees earned nods for portraying famous personages—but playing gay is coming on strong. With trends colliding, almost half of this year’s nominations went to portrayals of people who are famous and/or gay. Consulting the diagram below, I don’t see how Philip Seymour Hoffman can possibly lose.

3046	 2001	a	That announcement followed shortly after the demise of 1stUp, a Spinway competitor owned by CMGI, the Net holding company. 1stUp, based in San Francisco, was the technology behind free service from Alta Vista and Excite@Home's FreeLane, along with dozens of smaller niche services, like Gay .com, Senior.com and Afronet.com. Shortly after 1stUp's announcement, Alta Vista said that it was canceling its free service; other 1stUp partners are still hoping to find a home someplace else.Back in July, Juno gobbled up two competitors, Freewwweb and WorldSpy, both of which declared bankruptcy and then began referring subscribers to Juno's site.That leaves NetZero and Juno still standing as the industry leaders, each with 3.7 million active users, along with a handful of miscellaneous Web retailers still hoping that sales of merchandise will make up for their free Internet services. But even the two remaining major free providers are walking on rather thin ice these days: like many Internet stocks, shares of both Juno and NetZero, which are embroiled in patent lawsuits against each other over the way ads are displayed on computer screens, have been pummeled in recent weeks. Shares of Juno, which traded at $41.63 in January, closed under a dollar last week. NetZero was also under a dollar, down from a 52-week high of $36.38.Yet rather than disappear entirely, analysts predict that free I.S.P. services are likely to continue in some form, for those customers who do not overuse them. Many analysts say that tiered pricing programs like those announced by Juno and NetZero are the future, and the challenge now is to convert users of the free service into paying customers.Not that long ago, Internet customers bought service by the minute, much like long-distance telephone service -- for upward of $100 a month for active users. But by the late 1990's, most Internet providers in the United States had modified their business models, switching to flat monthly fees in an effort to gain more revenue from advertisers and electronic commerce and less from subscriptions. It appeared for some players that eliminating the subscription fee altogether was simply the next step. Adding it back now appears to be yet another one.But it could be that major fee-based services like America Online, the Microsoft Network and CompuServe will end up as biggest beneficiaries of the free-I.S.P. shakeout. All three already offer tiered service, with limited plans priced as low as at $9.95. As more active users are removed from free services, analysts say, they may migrate to those more established names rather than pay the amount to a relative newcomer who might not offer the same level of service.NetZero, however, has considerable brand recognition these days, the result of an advertising blitz that includes television spots during N.B.A. games, and the company's chairman and chief executive, Mark R. Goldston, says the company is signing up new subscribers at a record pace.
428	 2016	a	But these bits are scattered in an uneven series of sketches piled and paper-clipped together like the documents on the table. The show’s twin political preoccupations of colonialism and gender often split apart, and the successive segments, sometimes separating into just sound or just film, are widely spaced, as if Mr. Hafez didn’t trust his audience to process more than one idea or sensation at a time. Instead, for large swaths of the nearly two-hour duration, he seems determined to make viewers experience the terrible boredom of any political conference, even one that upends the world.Boredom is also risked in “-55,” a solo that the Moroccan choreographer Raduoan Mriziga performed at New York Live Arts on Thursday. In street clothes, he executes a series of tasks, eventually creating an intricate design on the floor with chalk and tape. The title tells you how many minutes it takes.Since 2008, Mr. Mriziga has lived and worked in Brussels, where he attended the influential school P.A.R.T.S. “-55,” his first work, seems to be in a familiar mode of Euro-American postmodernism. The initial motions — walking, arm swinging, lying on his back — are pedestrian, though lightly decorated with snaps, claps, curlicues and hand-to-foot suggestions of folk dance. Segments repeat, in different orientations.In addition to the body percussion, sound comes from five cassette decks placed (as is the audience) on four sides surrounding Mr. Mriziga. The sound is highly fragmentary, as if mostly erased. When Mr. Mriziga lays out his floor geometry, he measures its proportions with his body: a line twice his height, a circle traced from the turning point of an elbow with the radius of a forearm.
5791	 1985	a	Orlando Pizzolato has become a minor celebrity, the kind only a few people recognize.He arrived in New York Sunday for a week of promotional work for the Oct. 27 New York City Marathon, which he won last year. Sunday night, he ran in Central Park, and if anyone's head turned when he passed, he didn't notice it.''Nobody knows who I am,'' he said yesterday. ''Nobody knows my face here. In Italy, my name is famous. I like it when people come up to me and talk and take pictures and ask for my autograph. It hasn't happened enough to me not to like it.''It almost happened last week in Italy, where Pizzolato ran in a series of races much like cycling's Tour de France. Everyone seemed to want to take his picture or get his autograph or have coffee with him. He wanted to run and train. He compromised - many pictures, too much coffee and enough running to fill his needs.This will be his fourth New York City Marathon. In 1982 and 1983, his trips were financed by Champion, the sportswear company that sponsors his club team. In 1982, he dropped out after 15 miles, his legs as limp as spaghetti because this was his third marathon in five weeks. In 1983, he finished 27th, high enough for the marathon sponsors to pay his expenses to the 1984 race.
1696	 2009	a	Chevrolet-Saturn of Harlem became the first affiliate of General Motors to seek Chapter 11 protection as the carmaker prepares for a massive government-sponsored restructuring.The dealership, which Reuters noted is owned by G.M., a rarity, filed for bankruptcy in federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan. While G.M. has not yet filed — it is expected to do so around 8 a.m. — the company described G.M. as a “debtor-in-possession under Chapter 11.” (Read the filing after the jump.)Chevrolet-Saturn of Harlem listed more than $1 billion in liabilities. It is seeking to retain a slew of advisers who are also representing G.M., including the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges and the investment banks Evercore Partners and the Blackstone Group.Its largest creditors were listed as the Wilmington Trust Company, representing holders of nearly $22.8 billion of bond debt, and affiliates of the United Automobile Workers union, representing nearly $20.6 billion in employee obligations.Reuters noted that according to federal bankruptcy rules, companies have one of three criteria to fulfill to file a Chapter 11 case in a particular district. G.M. is incorporated in Delaware, and its principal place of business is in Michigan. So in order to avail itself of the New York court system, it needed an affiliate that had already filed for bankruptcy in that district.Bankruptcy Filing of Chevrolet-Saturn of Harlem

1763	 2009	a	Jeff Larkin Jeff LarkinIt’s not often that fans of “Theater Talk” and “Monday Night Football” converge, but that just might happen at “Fantasy Football: The Musical?,” a show making its world premiere at the New York Musical Theater Festival.The piece was written and composed by David Ingber, a 24-year-old Harvard grad and self-proclaimed “sports and theater nut.” Set in 1991, it tells the story of two friends — an unemployed sports statistics geek and a small-time bookie — who combine their love of stats and gambling to come up with what Mr. Ingber calls “the ultimate fan experience.”The score, a pop-rock mix, is influenced by Mr. Ingber’s nostalgia for the music of the early 90s.“If people miss Ace of Base and PM Dawn, come on down,” he said.Following are excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Ingber a few days before the first performance.Q.When I read the title of this show I thought, uh-oh. Musical theater people and fantasy football people don’t mix.A.Anyone that I’ve told this title to — just the title alone — they either smile and say that’s the most hilarious idea ever or they say, Well, that will never work. I love either challenge. If we can get a few sports fans in that have never seen theater before just because they’re piqued by the title, awesome. If we can get some theater fans to appreciate sports for the first time, that’s awesome too.I’m in rare company as a huge sports nut and a huge theater nut. Some of our cast members are in that category. There are some of us out there.Q.Are you concerned that neither group will show up? That theater people will stay away and sports people will too?A.We already know that they’re not going to stay away because we’ve sold out everything. NYMF keeps giving us more and more shows and we keep selling them out. We’re happy to say that we only have a handful of tickets left for our final extension performance, and that’s on a Thursday at 11 p.m., and that’s selling pretty well.Q.Why the question mark in the title?A.I thought people would read the poster and put a question mark on there anyway, that they might look at it and say, “Fantasy football, the musical? Really? Come on.” So we preempted that. It’s very tongue in cheek. I wanted to set that attitude in motion, that we know how kooky and goofy it is.Q.What’s the musical style of the show? What do the songs sound like?A.I try to mix up the genres. There’s one character who’s a singer-songwriter, so she’s got a toned-down ballad. There’s one character who’s an up-and-coming early 90s hip-hop star, so he brings that flava to the mix. A lot of it is pop-rock or power ballads. I think power ballads are the greatest thing in musical history.Q.Why do you think there aren’t there more sports-themed musicals?A.“Damn Yankees” is the one people think about as the super successful sports-themed musical, although of course that’s more of a Faust musical than it is a sports musical.But if you look in the entertainment landscape a little bit wider, there are a lot of sports-related things. “Friday Night Lights” I think is one of the best shows on television. There’s that new show, “The League,” on FX at the end of the month, which is actually about a fantasy football league.“Fantasy Football: The Musical?” opens tonight at 8 p.m., and runs at various times through Thursday, Oct. 8. More information is available at the show’s Web site or at NYMF.org.
3765	 1997	a	''The only people who did not lose money were those who couldn't put their hands on any,'' said Mr. Prushi. ''There were people who sold their houses, others sold their cows, and now their children don't even have milk.''Mrs. Rinxhi reached for the cigarettes she started smoking again when the crisis began, her eyes filling with tears. ''We are in a terrible situation,'' she said. ''It can't be worse.''Today Mr. Xhaferri is in jail, his fund seized by the Government; Marta, the woman who ran the local Xhaferri office, collecting wads of leks -- the Albanian currency -- from people who spent hours waiting in line, has disappeared. And the people of Fushe-Kruja, a shabby, dusty town of 25,000, responded last weekend by joining the rest of the country in street demonstrations, which, in some places have turned into near-riots.Thrown on the defensive, the center-right Government of President Sali Berisha has promised to restore at least some of the missing money to the people on Nov. 5, to be distributed through savings account passbooks and options to bid on state property. The Government has also lashed out at its already feeble opposition and has blamed opponents for fomenting the violence last weekend.But here, where the demonstrations were peaceful, residents insist that the Government is to blame for the catastrophe that has befallen them. Like many others, they are waiting to see if President Berisha fulfills his promise. ''We want our money,'' said Mr. Prushi. ''We don't want pieces of paper.''Fushe-Kruja, like many small towns in this nation of 3.5 million, was a relative late-comer to the national craze, which by October of last year had reached frenzied levels. By then funds like Xhaferri were stepping up efforts to collect more money, opening new offices, promising ever higher rates of return over ever shorter periods of time -- all signs that the bubble was about to burst.But when Mr. Xhaferri came here, nobody really wanted to ask him hard questions, like how he could promise to triple their money in three months in a country with meager investments and 20 percent unemployment.
1008	 2013	a	LONG--Joan. On Thursday, June 20th, 2013 Joan D. Long relaxed her hold on the world she fiercely loved. A graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design, Columbia University, and Fordham University, Joan was a painter, ceramist, and dedicated recreational therapist. Joan was tender, elusive, practical, wildly inventive, and gave aesthetic consideration to all of her endeavors. She gently but relentlessly pushed for clarity in her work, in art, and in matters of the heart. Like Charlotte A. Cavatica, the noble spider of children's literature, Joan leaves a generation of descendants born of her encouragement and wise counsel. Dear friend, sister, cousin, and aunt, you are irreplaceable.

2595	 2004	a	The talks between the companies were ordered last week by Michael K. Powell, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, as the agency and the industry face impending legal deadlines. As the Bush administration considers whose side to take in the lobbying war over the leasing rates, top executives from both sides decided to participate in the discussions in order not to offend government officials and regulators.Participants in the discussions included Ivan Seidenberg, Verizon's chairman and chief executive, Michael D. Capellas, MCI's president and chief executive, and David W. Dorman, the chairman and chief executive of AT&T.But participants in the discussions said that the talks have left both sides far apart, with the exception of Qwest and MCI. Still, the deal was the most significant one in the area since an appeals court earlier this year threw out the old rate rules.The talks were the latest round in what has been years of litigation and lobbying over the relationship between the regional Bell companies and their rivals. The issue involved in the discussions amounts to billions of dollars in payments made by the long distance providers and small telephone companies to the regional Bell companies. Those small rivals say that their industry, which was created by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and its requirement for low-cost leasing, could be largely obliterated by any significant increases in lease rates.The Bell companies have replied that they are not getting a large enough financial return on their leased equipment to justify making significant new capital expenditures. They also maintain that the marketplace has become sufficiently competitive and that the rate structure is no longer justified.

5570	 1986	a	Who ordained that the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which spans the entrance to New York Harbor, should be toll-free eastbound? No less authority than the Congress of the United States, that's who.This Federal intrusion on city traffic management grew out of a local squabble.The bridge links Staten Island and Brooklyn and carries through traffic between Long Island and New Jersey, and points west. The toll gates are all on Staten Island, and the backup of waiting cars fouled the air. Staten Islanders therefore petitioned for free passage eastbound and double tolls for the westbound return.Local and state authorities refused. The one-way toll on the bridge would make possible a cheap round trip for drivers who cross into Brooklyn on the bridge and then return via Manhattan and the Holland Tunnel, which is free westbound. That would reduce revenues for the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority - and create perpetual gridlock in lower Manhattan.The Staten Islanders then took their proposal to their Representative, Guy Molinari, who pushed it through Congress with the help of his fellow Republican, Senator Alfonse D'Amato.

697	 2015	a	“Partisan,” in title at least, carries a whiff of the wild history of the Balkans. There is a postwar air to the opening scenes of Gregori (Vincent Cassel) salvaging pieces of broken furniture. He already has mattresses. Lots of mattresses. And eventually a compound with a harem of weirdly trusting women devoted to being baby machines despite Gregori’s lack of personal magnetism.In a wavering accent that is sometimes Borat, sometimes generic American game-show host and sometimes Christopher Walken (as himself and as “S.N.L.” ’s Continental), Gregori lectures his growing brood, educates them and teaches them to shoot, using balloons as targets. He is training them to defend against “the outsiders,” he says, but never specifies what they have to fear.Usually, partisans stand for something, but in this movie, which is stripped of a specific time frame and relevant geopolitical context, the term becomes hollow. The screenwriters, Ariel Kleiman (who is also the director) and Sarah Cyngler, have cut their story loose from any real significance, leaving us with Gregori, who has no discernible political views and no unifying beliefs, even delusional ones. Without this foundation for the character, the actor doesn’t stand a chance. As a cult leader, he is full of grand gestures but as aimless as a tiny plastic man in a terrarium.Eventually, he sends the children on assignment as assassins. The teenage Alexander (Jeremy Chabriel) goes on the job equipped with baby blue cotton balls as ear plugs. As adolescent boys should, he begins to question his elders. What have his targets done — the shopkeepers and mechanics he is sent to kill? Why should they die?

115	 2019	a	ImageCharly Evon SimpsonNational Playwrights Conference, O’Neill Theater CenterI went to the O’Neill having had two readings of “it’s not a trip it’s a journey,” but without having had the opportunity to really workshop the play. The process at the O’Neill starts with what they call a dream design — when designers discuss ideas and questions that came up for them as they read the piece. This session was incredibly helpful to me as it unearthed themes that I had not consciously thought through before.The play is about June, a black woman who convinces three of her friends to embark on a road trip. We see the characters in intimate spaces, in hotel rooms and in a car, and then at real public settings in the wide open United States. Those spaces include Lucy the Elephant, a six-story wood and tin elephant replica, in New Jersey; the largest ball of twine in Kansas; and the Grand Canyon in Arizona.This dream session put into words and images some of the tensions that exist between the characters. It also delved into the difficulty of creating the real spaces onstage. Lighting and sound cues could signal whether we were inside the car, or outside, but how would we depict Lucy the Elephant? We brainstormed solutions big and small. Lastly, the session gave me and my director, Nicole A. Watson, insight into how the play wants to work.The next five days were filled with conversations with the cast, director, dramaturge and other supporters and observers we had in the room. I was able to discover which aspects of the play needed more exploration and spent the evenings rewriting. Two public readings were wonderfully executed by the cast and crew, and it was lovely to watch how the audience connected to the characters. The play found firmer ground, coming alive in a way I hadn’t seen.

3346	 2000	a	Mr. Fischl, at any rate, is a star. He hit it in the early 80's with his figurative paintings, many of which involved disturbing sexual and social images in the supposedly safe setting of the suburbs. Mr. Fischl knew the suburbs, having been a Port Washington kid. One of his most talked about early works was ''Bad Boy,'' in which a woman lies naked on her bed while a young man reaches surreptitiously into her purse. This year a painting, ''Noonwatch,'' sold for $1 million. Mr. Fischl and his wife, April Gornick, a highly regarded landscape artist, have a home in Sag Harbor and a duplex in the Village.This is all very impressive for someone, who, as Mr. Fischl says, ''wasn't a good kid.''Mr. Fischl's father was a salesman. His mother? A brief pause, then an equally brief description. ''Housewife.'' Mr. Fischl speaks of flunking out of his first college; of living as a hippie in San Francisco; of his parents moving to the Southwest. But what he seems to enjoy discussing most is his work. He speaks wryly of trends in the art world, dryly funny in the style of Steve Martin and Mike Nichols, who are collectors and friends. When Mr. Fischl talks art, it is often Art Forum sort of stuff:''I was of a mind that you could paint from experience towards experience.'' Something feels as if it's missing. Could he give us a better sense of his parents?The answer comes back so bluntly and directly it is like a shot.''My mother was a ferocious alcoholic who ultimately killed herself,'' Mr. Fischl says. ''My father was trying to hold the whole thing together as best he could. And they just had this incredibly intense, really horrible relationship. She died in a car accident -- went out extremely drunk, to run herself off the road. I was 22. She did not want to live. That's what I think.''WHY was Mr. Fischl's mother so unhappy?''Aha, the mystery of mysteries,'' Mr. Fischl says with a bitter and slightly unpleasant edge. ''I always thought she just lacked discipline. She was very creative and her fantasy of herself was as an artist, and she always approached everything as if it had to be a masterpiece or it wasn't worth doing. She tried everything: painting, sculpture, crafts, writing, but every time she put something out it was never good enough, it humiliated her.''The painting ''Bad Boy'' shows a boy seemingly taking money from a purse. Was that boy ever Mr. Fischl?

4674	 1992	a	P. A. Bergner & Company, the bankrupt retail company that operates the Carson Pirie Scott department stores, filed a lawsuit yesterday against Sears, Roebuck & Company and Arthur C. Martinez. The suit accuses Sears and Mr. Martinez, the new chairman of Sears's retail division, of breaking the executive's commitment to become chief executive of P. A. Bergner.The lawsuit, filed in New York, contends that Mr. Martinez, who was until yesterday vice chairman of Saks Fifth Avenue, committed himself to accepting a position as Bergner's chief executive in a deal that included a $1 million salary for three years, a $1 million signing bonus and several other perquisites.On Aug. 10, Sears abruptly announced that Mr. Martinez would head its $31 billion retailing unit, stunning Bergner's, which had filed papers a week earlier in bankruptcy court seeking approval of a contract with Mr. Martinez.The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages from Sears and Mr. Martinez, also says that Sears illegally interfered with Bergner's business. A spokesman for Sears said the company had not reviewed the suit and declined to comment.
3749	 1997	a	FOR a week, you have eyed that five-pound box of cheap cookies that a business associate sent over. You have wondered what to do with the scraps of Christmas ham.You are not alone. Professional caterers have dealt with the leftovers problem year in and year out. They have to. You may worry about how leftovers will affect your waistline. They worry about how waste affects their bottom line.So what does happen to perfectly edible food that caterers prepare but the guests don't eat? And what about the end pieces from many sides of smoked salmon or the stems from 100 pounds of mushrooms?If a client does not want to keep the leftover food, the caterer is responsible for disposing of it. A lot, of course, goes to shelters. Some must be thrown away for safety reasons. But some can be recycled. So can food that never leaves the catering establishment: the unused parts of ham and mushrooms, broccoli and salmon.

Traficant Jr. of Youngstown, Ohio, was seeing Washington for the first time. ''I had a meeting with the Speaker Tuesday evening and it took me a half-hour to find his office, but he waited for me,'' he said.''The place is just laden with tradition - it's evident everywhere,'' Mr. Traficant went on, looking about the muraled, marbled corridor. ''The whole orientation has been very thorough. I interpret it to mean that they want you take the job seriously even if you don't take yourself seriously.''The five-day orientation of panels, seminars and lectures that began Wednesday and will wind up Tuesday focuses on matters ranging from Congressional ethics and office automation to the use of the Congressional frank and advice on seeking committee assignments and setting up a Congressional office.

1817	 2008	a	Voters in New Jersey who cast absentee ballots for a candidate who has dropped out of the presidential race can vote again, a state judge has ruled. The ruling by the judge, Vincent J. Grasso of State Superior Court in Ocean County, dealt specifically with the Ocean County Clerk but has bearing statewide, according to the New Jersey attorney general’s office.The ballot for Tuesday’s presidential primary was printed about a month ago. Because the field of candidates has narrowed considerably since then in both parties, the ballot has the names of six candidates who are no longer running. The candidates include four Democrats, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, and two Republicans, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York and former Senator Fred D. Thompson of Tennessee.Under Judge Grasso’s ruling, if someone cast their absentee ballot for one of those six candidates, they are allowed to request a new ballot from their county clerk’s office and revote.David Wald, a spokesman for Attorney General Anne Milgram, said New Jersey law does not specifically address whether absentee voters can vote again if their first choice for a candidate was eliminated before the election.“There’s a gap in the statute on this particular question,” Mr. Wald said.To avoid counting two ballots from the same person, Mr. Wald said county clerks have safeguards in place. The clerk’s office will flag the replacement ballot, and then provide a list of names of all the voters who have requested a replacement ballots to the local board of elections, which counts the ballots.And even before the clerk issues a replacement ballot, they would have to sign an affidavit swearing that they are voting again because their first choice is no longer in the race.Mr. Wald said on Friday that he had heard anecdotal reports from county clerks across the state that they had so far received only a handful of request for replacement absentee ballots.Read more Primary Journal blog entries from the New York region.

5514	 1987	a	New proof of the links between mental problems and overall health has been mustered in a large study of 29,915 Federal employees and their families who filed claims for mental-health treatment with Aetnafrom 1980 to 1983. The average of their claims for health problems of all kinds - not just psychological problems - was $158.82 a month, more than 70 percent higher than health insurance claims of 16,468 other Federal employee families with the same coverage but no mental problems. On an encouraging note, after mental-health treatment, the group's use of both mental and general health care declined, to $137 a month, according to James O. Blose, an analyst with the Human Ecology Institute in Chapel Hill, N.C.Despite the downward trend, however, the average claim for people with psychological problems remained higher after three years of mental-health treatment than the average - $108 a month - three years before treatment was started.Mr. Blose and Harold D. Holder, director of the Prevention Research Center in Berkeley, Calif., published these findings in the October issue of Hospital and Community Psychiatry.Dr. Kessler, of American Psychmanagement, said large employers had recently been paying more attention to their mental-health costs, which often are rising 25 percent. Not soon enough, however, said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a health-care analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Company. ''Very few employers intelligently manage their mental-health benefits,'' he said. ''Corporate America has got to rethink its whole atttitude toward mental-health benefits, and I don't see them doing that until they get totally taken to the cleaners.'' Jeff Goldsmith, head of Health Futures, a Chicago management consultant firm, is equally vehement. ''One of the hottest areas for cost containment over the next two or three years will be in-patient psychiatric services, because of widespread abuse,'' Mr. Goldsmith said. ''So much of what they are doing could be moved to an out-patient basis.''One method for minimizing hospitalization is a process known as case management. Service companies like Dr. Kessler's keep track of each mental-health claim. The case managers, who usually are psychiatric social workers or nurse clinical specialists, advise physicians about alternatives to hospitalization, which may cost $4,000 per patient.

5773	 1985	a	Puccini's 'Manon Lescaut' A Royal Opera production filmed at Covent Garden, featuring Kiri Te Kanawa, Placido Domingo and Thomas Allen; conducted by Giuseppe Sinopoli Thorn EMI Video 130 minutes. $79.95 ''Manon Lescaut'' may not be everybody's cup of operatic tea, but those devoted to it should find this video cassette a special treat.Here is an ardent 18th-century love story that involves a riches-to-rags progression - and all the scenic variety entailed - before the hapless pair die together on a desert island near New Orleans.Implausible? Yes, but, oh, so appealing as acted and sung by Miss Te Kanawa and Mr. Domingo, both of whom are slim enough and young enough to be attractive even in close-ups. The seeming ease and naturalness of their singing gives the performance special believability. Other positive factors include Mr. Allen's portrayal of Lescaut, Manon's scheming brother, and Mr. Sinopoli's splendid conducting.The Gotz Friedrich production was conceived for the Hamburg Opera and borrowed for use at Covent Garden (this version was filmed there in 1983). There are no scenic or directorial surprises in it, but Gunther Schneider-Siemssen's set for Act II - the rich part - is notably lavish in a nouveau-riche way.

2559	 2004	a	IF a computer can have sex appeal, it is probably demonstrated most clearly in high-end gaming laptops. While young men in decades past might have lusted after the latest automotive hardware, the players (almost all young men) who gathered at a gaming party near Buffalo last month have a different passion. It made them enthusiastic road-testers of three roughly comparable laptops -- from Alienware, Dell and VoodooPC -- that a reporter asked them to size up.Each laptop came with a DVD/CD burner, 1 gigabyte of RAM, a 60-gigabyte hard drive and built-in Wi-Fi networking capability. All were in the $3,000 vicinity.The Dell and VoodooPC units also had Bluetooth wireless connectivity. The VoodooPC included a built-in videoconferencing camera, and the Alienware had its own remote control. The VoodooPC included the Professional version of Windows XP, while the others used the Home Edition.Dell's unit was the fastest, but with its bulky case, it also ran the coolest. The VoodooPC was not quite as fast as the others, but its lustrous finish and elegant design attracted the most attention. The Alienware fit between the other two in both styling and speed. (The makers of Alienware and VoodooPC, in particular, pointed out that the laptops they provided were not at the top of their product lines; the best are even faster and can top $4,000.)
661	 2015	a	Derp — views that just keep being repeated in the face of overwhelming contrary evidence — has always been with us, but the derp quotient has really soared since the crisis of 2008, which made nonsense of doctrines too dearly held to be reconsidered. This is especially true of inflation derp: has any prominent figure who warned of runaway inflation from the Fed’s efforts admitted having learned anything from being wrong year after year?It seems increasingly clear to me that what we’re looking at here has nothing to do with intellectual discourse as we normally understand it. It is, instead, about tribal identities: there’s a certain kind of person who rails against policies that debase the dollar, and that kind of person admires others who do the same no matter how wrong their predictions and disastrous their financial advice. As I said in a brief note on Ron Paul, it’s a form of Madoff-style affinity fraud, even if the perpetrator of the scam believes his own derp.As you might guess, I’ve received some mail from Ron Paul admirers deeply angered by the suggestion that they are not engaged in deep intellectual argument. By and large the mail reads like this:Dear shmak, Paul Krugman!Stop insulting Ron Paul!You are low level Socialist/Liberal who should be jailed for Lifeyour insulting writing style.Ron Paul is Real Man with Capital Mand you are nobody!But the thing is, it’s not just the libertarians who do this sort of thing. Awesomely, Richard Fisher, now retiring as president of the Dallas Fed, is apparently regarded as an intellectual giant — he “rose to the status of being a deity in Texas” — despite a track record of being wrong again and again.A brief aside: the WSJ engages in a fairly common practice when describing inflationistas, namely that of whitewashing what they have actually spent year after year warning against. No, Fisher didn’t warn against “frothy financial markets”. He warned against inflation — inflation that kept not happening.Why all the respect for what would ordinarily be considered a record of repeated bad judgment coupled with a lamentable unwillingness to learn from experience? The answer, surely, is that within the conservative tribe issuing dire warnings against inflation is considered virtuous whether or not they are right; it’s a way of showing that you’re their kind of guy, that you belong to the tribe.Of course, saying things like that means that I should be jailed for life.

2389	 2005	a	They asked for policy details and all results since the N.F.L. began testing for steroids. The league began testing for steroids in 1987 and started random, year-round drug testing in 1990. The committee is not asking for the identities of individual players -- 44 are known to have been suspended for testing positive -- but it is asking for the number of players tested and the number of positive tests for each drug.Tagliabue promised full cooperation. The N.F.L. has one of the toughest steroids policies in professional sports and recently announced it wanted to toughen its program to Olympic standards.The letter to the N.F.L. was the first in a series of letters that will be sent to the other sports organizations as early as Monday, Robert White, a spokesman for the committee, wrote in an e-mail message yesterday.Davis and Waxman also wrote in the letter to Tagliabue that the committee would hold additional hearings at an unspecified time. They had previously said they would consider additional hearings after the March 17 hearing, at which the retired slugger Mark McGwire refused to answer questions about whether he had used steroids and members of Congress criticized baseball's new steroids policy."As the committee has stated publicly numerous times, its focus on the issue of performance-enhancing drug use in sports is not limited to professional baseball," Davis and Waxman wrote to Tagliabue. "The hearing was the first in a series for the committee as part of its ongoing investigation into steroid policies for professional and amateur sports."

1167	 2012	a	Advice Parental Quandary Every Friday, we pose a question to the Motherlode community. The next week, we pull together the best responses. Got a quandary? E-mail KJ ». Read more »This week’s quandary came from a message J. sent via Facebook: How, she asked, can we keep the children in our great, family-friendly neighborhood from hanging out with us in our yard — all the time?J.’s block sounds pretty idyllic. “Kids run around unsupervised, go from one yard to another without thinking about boundaries, neighbors know each others’ kids …” Which means that whenever there’s a backyard activity, suddenly, there’s a whole party of children ready and willing to jump in. That’s great if you’re a kid at loose ends for the afternoon, and not so great if you’re trying to have an outdoor party with just visiting family, or just don’t feel like having the whole neighborhood in your backyard.My husband, who works from home and so is available after school at times a lot of working parents aren’t (including me), wants to toss a football or visit the river to explore with our boys in the afternoon. He expresses frustration that he wants to share those experiences with his own sons, not a larger group of neighborhood kids.J. knows this is a good problem to have, but still, it’s a problem, if only one of tact and etiquette. She doesn’t want to be unfriendly, and often, the neighborhood kids are perfectly welcome at her house, just as her children often are at other houses on the block.“We just wonder,” she writes, “how to communicate ‘this is family time’ or ‘this is a backyard gathering, spontaneous and casual, but you’re still not invited,’ without alienating others,” particularly when those others are just kids.
1576	 2010	a	MILAN – If Chris Mullin ever becomes a Knicks executive, as has long been speculated, he will surely be thrilled with the roster he inherits.Mullin came to Italy this week to help the N.B.A. promote the Knicks’ exhibition game against Armani Jeans Milano. On Friday, he presided over a 3-point contest on the plaza next to the Duomo and later participated in a community service event.Donnie Walsh, the Knicks president, has long been fond of Mullin, who once played for Walsh’s Indiana Pacers. There are persistent rumors that Walsh wants to hire Mullin but has been blocked by team ownership.Mullin skirted the speculation on Friday but he enthusiastically praised the work Walsh has done to revitalize the Knicks.“I think it’s been pretty dramatic, actually,” Mullin told a handful of New York reporters. “Now you’ve got to wait and see how it is on the court. But they’ve made a lot of changes. Obviously, Amar’e is a huge part of that.”Walsh stripped the roster over the last two years to clear salary-cap room, with LeBron James as the primary target. When James chose Miami, Walsh landed Amar’e Stoudemire, one of the top big men in the league, then filled out the roster with a number of promising players, including Raymond Felton, Anthony Randolph, Roger Mason, Kelenna Azubuike and Timofey Mozgov.“I don’t know anyone who could have done a better job than he’s done already,” Mullin said. “The work he did to get under the cap, to be in the position he was last summer, and then to get Amar’e, that’s the way you do it. You always have a plan, and Donnie, wherever he’s been, there’s no mistake, his teams have gradually gotten better.”Mullin said that Stoudemire’s presence would make a huge difference, particularly for talented young players like Wilson Chandler and Danilo Gallinari.“When you have a team of good players, almost on a daily basis you’re kind of scouring around to see where the pyramid falls into place,” said Mullin, a former Golden State Warriors general manager. “When you get a key guy like Amar’e, not only does it help situate your team, I think it helps the other guys focus on what they do best. Sometimes when you don’t have that marquee guy, you try to do more than you’re capable of doing.”Needless to say, Mullin is also optimistic about the future of Randolph. Mullin, after all, drafted him for the Warriors in 2008. Randolph is fantastically athletic but unpolished. He has been slowed by injuries.“His talent is incredible,” Mullin said. “He’s a hard worker, he’s a good kid. Careers take different paths. He was injured last year. But what I saw of him in practice, his potential is pretty high. Sometimes that’s dangerous, because there is so much talent there. But I think once he gets into a stable situation, he’ll do really well.”As for his own future, Mullin said he wanted to return to an N.B.A. front office eventually, but was in no rush. He said he had had no recent discussions with Walsh.“I’ve been doing a lot for the N.B.A. Taking these trips has been great,” he said. “So for me, the right situation comes up, I would definitely look at it. But I’m not really struggling with what I’m doing. I’m pretty happy. So no, no real time frame on that.”

466	 2016	a	​Waiting for High TideWritten and illustrated by Nikki McClureIt’s six hours from low tide to high tide, and the narrator of the latest paper-cut marvel from McClure (“Mama, Is It Summer Yet?”) is impatient. Her family is building a raft. She roams the beach collecting cool stuff and checking out barnacles. The raft gets done, but there’s more waiting before they can push off. Finally, they float away and jump in the water “again and again and again.” Heaven! There’s also info on checking the tides in Washington State, and a funny bit about safely using a hatchet.

5449	 1987	a	To the Editor:Tom Boasberg recognizes the quality of the New York City Department of Health's AIDS prevention efforts (Op-Ed, July 11), but presents an inadequate impression of the quantity and impact of our work.Each month, the department counsels more than 8,000 individuals through our telephone hotline service; trains 3,000 professionals in risk-reduction education, and educates more than 10,000 people through our community-based programs. The city contracts with community-based organizations for more than $1 million of additional outreach services and distributes more than 1 million pieces of printed information each month.Counseling and testing are at city-and state-run facilities and through private physicians, with laboratory services provided free by the city. Each day our media efforts reach countless New Yorkers, the most recent campaign emphasizing condom use on television, radio and in print.To prevent further spread of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus, funding education is not the only issue. Our ability to reach more people is hindered by reluctance of some in the media to air our campaigns to educate the public about preventing the spread of infection. The inextricable relationship between AIDS and intravenous-drug use also calls for the rapid expansion of state and federally funded drug-treatment services; this is the key to the future course of the epidemic in New York City. STEPHEN C. JOSEPH, M.D. Commissioner of Health New York, July 16, 1987

1485	 2010	a	Stan Honda/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesIntroduced on: There was no official New York coming-out party.Is it real? Sure is. Assembly lines in Trollhättan, Sweden, are once again cranking out cars after a dramatic ninth-inning save by Spyker Cars. Sculpted under the authority of General Motors, the Saab 9-5 emerged surprisingly Scandinavian with its stalwart, sinuous physique at the Frankfurt auto show in September.What they said: Saab says the second-generation 9-5 was mostly developed in the company’s Trollhättan headquarters, where it will also be built. While it may take some time for the dust to settle from the bruised automaker’s shakeup, the 9-5 offers a kernel of substance for the company’s new owners.What they didn’t say: Whether or not Spyker will ultimately be rewarded with a happy ending for its plucky resolve to keep Saab afloat. To compete, the Saab 9-5 must woo buyers in a heavy-hitter league that includes the Mercedes-Benz E-Class, the BMW 5 Series and the Audi A6. Success rides on how much Spyker is willing to invest in the long-term game to regain consumer trust and dedication to the discerning high-end Swedish aesthetic.What makes it tick? Feisty turbo power, nimble all-wheel drive and smartly placed aeronautic references like the Pilot Head-Up display. The initial 2.8-liter V-6 engine offering spouts 300 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque. The turbocharged BioPower 4-cylinder E85 engine will follow. All transmissions will be 6-speeds.How soon? How much? The 9-5 is due in dealerships this summer with estimated prices upward of $40,000.How does it look? Like a Saab, which is a compliment for a company that has traditionally been on the fringes with athletic, functional forms. The 9-5 is the thinking person’s sports sedan with sweeping spatial proportions extracted from the concept Aero X.
3444	 1999	a	Fed Cup Move Suits KingRecruiting just got a little easier for Billie Jean King, the Fed Cup captain, now that the April 17-18 confrontation between the United States and Croatia has been moved from Zagreb because of security concerns in the Balkans.After ruling out Hamburg, Germany, as an alternate site, the International Tennis Federation announced its approval of the move to the United States, presumably to a clay court site in Florida or the Carolinas. But King disclosed Tuesday that regardless of where the match is played, neither of the Williams sisters will be on the team.Venus repeated as the Lipton champion on Sunday by ending the 16-match unbeaten streak of her younger sister in the final.Last year the sisters used schoolwork as an excuse to skip the Fed Cup, and they also implied that, as Jehovah's Witnesses, they were precluded from putting their country ahead of their God when they took to the court. But their father/ coach, Richard, appeared to volunteer them for duty during one of the news conferences he gave at the Lipton.''I love America, so if I could play the Fed Cup and represent America, off, I'm gone,'' said Williams, who, unlike his daughters, is not a Jehovah's Witness.King seemed perplexed by the Florida-based family's stance on the Fed Cup.''First the Williamses said yes and then they said no,'' King said. ''I don't know what's going on there, but it's a little too late to worry about it now. Your first priority is to get a team together that really wants to play.''King already had a commitment from the second-ranked Lindsay Davenport and anticipates that the venue change will enable Monica Seles to join the team. King was disinclined to ask Seles, an ethnic Hungarian raised in Serbia who lives in Sarasota, Fla., to compete in Croatia or in Hamburg, the city where she was stabbed in midmatch six years ago.

2660	 2004	a	The new tools inevitably conjure up "Fantastic Voyage," the 1960's science-fiction thriller in which a medical team was shrunk and launched into a patient's bloodstream in a cell-size submarine to wipe out a blood clot in the victim's brain. Indeed, Dr. Aaron J. Fleischman, co-director of the laboratory that Cleveland Clinic set up five years ago to provide researchers with engineering support for very small-scale devices, said that doctors initially asked him when he would start building tiny intelligent submarines -- minus the shrunken crew, of course.While researchers do discuss the feasibility of making tiny robotic devices able to maneuver inside the body and perform a variety of tasks, most current research and new product development is focused on nano-scale particles.Quantum dots, metallic particles that emit bright light in a color range that varies with their size, are now frequently used to study tumors and locate proteins that researchers want to study. By attaching antibodies that prefer to bind with specific types of cells to dots of different sizes, the researchers can get a multicolored image showing the location and concentration of many elements inside a tissue sample.Nanoparticles may help researchers overcome obstacles in gene therapy, which seeks to treat genetically inherited diseases like cystic fibrosis by implanting healthy genes to do the work of damaged ones.Nanoparticles may also be used to deliver heat to cancer cells to kill them. MagForce Technologies, based in Berlin, coats iron oxide nanoparticles with a compound that is a nutrient for tumor cells, which then ingest the particles. When an external magnetic field causes the particles to vibrate rapidly, the tumor cells are killed and then flushed from the body by its natural scavenger cells, according to MagForce's research results.MagForce expects regulatory approval to sell the particles and its treatment machinery in Germany in 2006 after more extensive clinical trials have been completed. A German insurer has already agreed to reimburse hospitals there for the technology, based on early results, according to Dr. Andreas Jordan, the company's chief executive. Dr. Jordan said he was negotiating with large American equipment vendors in hopes of finding a partner big enough to cope with the costs of getting regulatory and reimbursement approval in the United States.Business issues aside, researchers say, nanotechnology in medicine faces so many technical hurdles that long delays and numerous failures are inevitable. "The complexity of biology is clearly beyond our comprehension at this time," said Dr. James R. Baker Jr., director of the Center for Biologic Nanotechnology at the University of Michigan. "That's why so many drugs fail."

3619	 1998	a	From her first day on Capitol Hill -- the day she dismayed her colleagues by introducing her Vietnam resolution -- Ms. Abzug derided the Congressional club, the seniority system, the log-rolling and back-scratching. She did not spare fellow Democrats; when she spoke of liberals, it was usually dismissively. She badgered the House leadership over committee appointments and votes.She badgered the President, too. Invited to a reception at Richard Nixon's White House, she accepted (while writing in her journal, ''Who wants to listen to his pious idiocies?''), then announced to Nixon in the receiving line that her constituents demanded a withdrawal from Vietnam.For all of her railing against Democrats who went along to get along, Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill named her one of his dozen assistant whips, and by most accounts she worked well with some of the crustiest fixtures in the House.Still, a 1972 report by Ralph Nader estimated that Ms. Abzug's sponsorship of a measure often cost it 20 to 30 votes. Her reputation as an irritant came from all quarters. Jimmy Breslin wrote of a campaign worker who repaired to the Lion's Head one night, holding his side and swearing never to work for Ms. Abzug again. ''She punched me,'' he explained, in a quarrel over scheduling. The next day, Mr. Breslin reported, Ms. Abzug called the aide. ''Michael, I called to apologize,'' she said. ''How's your kidney?''Mr. Breslin also recounted the Congresswoman's introduction to Sol Linowitz, the former chairman of the Xerox Corporation and a Democratic Party luminary: ''Are you the man that used to be head of the Xerox?'' Ms. Abzug asked. ''That's right,'' Mr. Linowitz replied. ''I'm glad to meet a big shot,'' Ms. Abzug said. ''I'm in hock $35,000 on my campaign.''Ms. Abzug acknowledged loneliness in her years in Congress. ''Outside of Martin and the kids, I don't feel very related to most people at this point,'' she wrote in 1971. ''I feel detached in social situations. I'm always thinking about other things, about Congress, about the issues, about the political coalition I'm trying to organize. It never leaves me. I even have trouble relating to some of my closest friends, though God knows I still love them, even if they don't know it.''Always, she returned to Manhattan to spend weekends with her husband.She had married Martin Abzug in 1944. The two New Yorkers met on a bus in Miami, when both were on the way to a Yehudi Menuhin concert. Mr. Abzug, a stockbroker and an author of two published novels, had next to no interest in politics. In an interview in 1970, he murmured, while his wife was out of the room, ''The political bug is a curious bug.'' But he was, she said, her best friend and supporter, and ''one of the few unneurotic people left in society.''

5888	 1983	a	TRENTON THE first year of the Kean administration, a period marked by economic problems and partisan bickering, has ended. Prospects for continued turmoil in the State House during the coming legislative election year also appear great, for every major bill will be debated with an eye toward its effect on the re-election chances of the 120 members of the Senate and Assembly.Last year began with calls for bi-partisan cooperation by Governor Kean, who won election by the smallest margin in state history, and by the Democratic leaders in the Senate and Assembly. Mr. Kean, a Republican, was the first incoming Governor in recent history to win election without also pulling in majorities of his own party in both houses of the Legislature.This proved costly, as problems caused by the ailing national economy escalated routine partisan posturing into confrontation. Before the year ended, Mr. Kean had repeatedly called the legislative leadership ''irresponsible'' for failing to enact new taxes to support state budget needs. At the same time, both the Senate President, Carmen A. Orechio, Democrat of Nutley, and the Assembly Speaker, Alan J. Karcher, Democrat of Sayreville, pictured the Governor as ''timid'' and lacking the leadership to find a solution to the budget crisis.Relations between the two branches of government were strained during the first six months by the necessity of trimming more than $200 million from spending requests before enacting the current fiscal-year budget of $6.2 billion, a record high.
5285	 1988	a	Orders to United States factories for manufactured goods fell six-tenths of 1 percent in May as a sharp drop in demand for aircraft offset strength in other areas.The Commerce Department said today that factory orders declined $1.36 billion, to a seasonally adjusted $217.97 billion in May. It was the largest one-month decline since a 1.4 percent plunge last August.Orders had been up sharply in the previous two months, rising by 1.5 percent in April and 1.6 percent in March. Analysts said the one-month breather would be good for the economy, giving factories more time to catch up with a backlog of unfilled orders. 'A Welcome Sign'''Orders had been growing at an unsustainably high rate,'' said Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass. ''This is a welcome sign because it eases the pressure a bit on an industrial sector that is operating at close to full capacity.''
2414	 2005	a	So Adrienne von Lates, the museum's curator of education, and Ms. Hernandez put together a curriculum of four two-hour workshops that could easily be offered at each center. To date, the program has served some 400 girls.Appearing scarcely older than a teenager herself, Ms. Hernandez, 25, is quick to establish a rapport with each group, a relationship somewhere between mentor and big sister. The first hour is like a college-level art history class: she gives an overview of the artists being discussed, shows slides and opens the room to discussion. The language in the reading material on the artists is sophisticated; as the girls read it aloud, and Ms. Hernandez reviews any words or ideas that are difficult."A lot of these girls suffer from low expectations," she said. "I really come at them expecting a lot, and very often they will meet me at that level."In the second hour, the teenagers work on an art project inspired by an artist they have just studied and that usually involves photography or collage. At the Village, one of the Lorna Simpson pieces, "Stereo Styles" (1988), consisted of 10 photographs of African-American women depicted from behind in identical dress, with only the hair styled differently. Running along the bottom of the serially mounted photos was the text: "Daring, Sensible, Severe, Long & Silky, Boyish, Ageless, Silly, Magnetic, Country Fresh, Sweet."The girls then each found a partner so they could photograph each other's hair from behind. "It's this idea of what hair says about you," Ms. Hernandez told the girls, many of whom had been playing with each other's hair before the workshop began and greeted the project with enthusiasm.One girl was concerned that her hair fell under the "boyish" category. "I think Lorna Simpson's talking about labels, and I think she's criticizing those labels," Ms. Hernandez said. Another chose to focus on the wildly curly tips of her subject's brown hair; another zoomed in so closely on a bun it seemed abstract.A popular art project in the program is based on a series of collages in which the Kenya-born artist Wangechi Mutu cobbled together pieces of advertisements from beauty magazines and assembled them to create disfigured women as a way of questioning cultural ideals of perfection.

4825	 1991	a	The summit meeting in Moscow made notable advances with the signing of a strategic arms accord and a dramatic commitment to convene a Mideast peace conference in October. But Presidents Bush and Gorbachev both shied away from the hard, imperative task of seeking deeper reductions in the nuclear arms that still imperil the world.Both said it would be impractical to eliminate their arsenals at a time when other nations still possess nuclear arms. Mr. Bush expressed particular concern about nuclear weapons in the hands of "renegades." But he seemed to rule out the risk of renegade nationalists or military officers in the Soviet Union gaining access to some of its huge stockpile of weapons. The best way to reduce that risk, however remote, is to negotiate further cuts.The Start treaty signed yesterday cuts the long-range nuclear arsenals of the two sides for the first time since the superpower arms race began. Just as important, it provides a framework of definitions, accounting practices and verification procedures that would facilitate further reductions without the need to retrace the long and tortured path that finally produced this treaty.Further reductions are needed because even with a 35 percent cut in Start, a chaotic Soviet Union still has 7,000 long-range nuclear weapons, and thousands more in its shorter-range arsenal. But the Soviets will only reduce these stockpiles if the U.S. agrees to corresponding cuts.

6282	 1972	a	SAIGON, South Vietnam, Dec. 1 — American intelligence sources say that North Vietnam has shifted almost all its antiaircraft defenses to its southern sector, in what they interpret as an indication that Hanoi does not expect to provoke the United States into resumption of the bombing farther north.The sources also said that, since the halt in mid‐October of bombing north of the 20th Parallel, the North Vietnamese have repaired the two main rail lines from Hanoi and the port of Haiphong to China and have run shuttle trains between major obstacles such as bridges destroyed by the bombing, which began last April.“They are working on the bigger projects like rebuilding the bridges,” a senior official said, “and it is clear they do not contemplate doing anything now that would provoke a resumption of the bombing up there.”In the view of the intelligence officials, the planning for a cease‐fire is as inexorable and irrevocable in Hanoi as in Washington.
4896	 1990	a	It has been a year of hurricanes and housing scandals, but also of quieter tales of American people and places. Here are the last, or at least the latest, chapters from the journals of 1989:William Van Orden, a sculptor in Venice, Calif., who is dying of cancer, finished yet another restoration of a statue of the actress Myrna Loy and has taken to his bed. An alarm system has been added to the metal cage that encloses the statue, and for the moment it is holding off the vandals who have destroyed the statue each time Mr. Van Orden has restored it, 12 times in the last decade by his count. But completion of the statue does not seem to have cured his unrequited ''romance'' with Myrna Loy, as he had hoped. ''I have still never heard from her,'' he said of the actress, who is now in her 80's and lives in New York City. ''That's a sad thing. It would have been nice to receive a little postcard or something.''As if putting lights in Wrigley Field was not enough to disturb baseball tradition, the Chicago Cubs spent the regular season in first place.

Earlier this year, readers in this city of 1,800 in the heart of Kansas oil and cattle country had a choice in which they took little consolation: rival weeklies produced by feuding factions of one family. They were the 110-year-old Rooks County Record, owned by 76-year-old Leon Hamilton, and the upstart Stockton Sentinel, owned by his son Bob.The Sentinel is the survivor. Leon is wintering in Arizona and another son, Barry, who helped his father run the Record, has returned to his teaching job in Olanthe, Kan.

657	 2015	a	Google continued to apologize Wednesday for a flaw in Google Photos, which was released to great fanfare in May, that led the new application to mistakenly label photos of black people as “gorillas.”The company said it had fixed the problem and was working to figure out exactly how it happened.“We’re appalled and genuinely sorry that this happened,” said a Google representative in an emailed statement. “We are taking immediate action to prevent this type of result from appearing.”From self-driving cars to photos, Google, like every technology company, is constantly releasing cutting-edge technologies with the understanding that problems will arise and that it will have to fix them as it goes. The idea is that you never know what problems might arise until you get the technologies in the hands of real-world users.In the case of the Google Photos app — which uses a combination of advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to help users collect, search and categorize photos — errors are easy to spot. When the app was unveiled at the company’s annual developer show, executives went through carefully staged demonstrations to show how it can recognize landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and give users the ability to search their photos for people, places or things — even things as specific as a particular dog breed.Of course, in practice, it is much messier. Google Photos mistakes dogs for horses and clocks for hubcaps. In my Google Photos, a picture of a friend’s bloody elbow, injured while skateboarding, was labeled “food.”But some mistakes are bigger than others, and on Sunday a Brooklyn software developer named Jacky Alciné, who is black, used Twitter to post an image that showed his Google Photos app had labeled a picture of Mr. Alciné and a friend as “gorillas.” In an interview, he said he figured posting on Twitter would lead to a much quicker fix.“Using a livestream (like Twitter) as opposed to waiting for a response is a lot more efficient,” he said.This proved correct. Within an hour and a half, a Google engineer named Yonatan Zunger, whose title is chief architect in the Google Plus social network, responded to his post, and promised swift action.That action includes temporarily removing nearly everything having to do with gorillas, including the ability to search for gorillas and the entire gorillas label.“There is still clearly a lot of work to do with automatic image labeling, and we’re looking at how we can prevent these types of mistakes from happening in the future,” added the Google representative.

5651	 1986	a	The emotionally charged Hamilton Tiger-Cats staged one of the most unexpected upsets in Canadian sports history today when they routed the Edmonton Eskimos, 39-15, in the Grey Cup title game.The underdog Tiger-Cats forced Edmonton to commit 10 turnovers, and the aggressive defense sacked the Eskimo quarterbacks, Matt Dunigan and Damon Allen, 13 times. Hamilton stunned the crowd of 59,621, a B.C. Place stadium record, with 17 first-quarter points to take command of the 74th Canadian Football League championship game.
2525	 2004	a	While lobbying for the state to recognize cost and tax differences, the Long Island superintendent's position paper stresses an even-handed approach to school aid reform. ''Long Island superintendents are not interested in engaging in regional competition for dollars,'' the report states. ''While others in the state are promoting an atmosphere of divisiveness through flashy public relations campaigns, we believe that the needs of all children in New York State, no matter where they live, should be met through a fair state aid formula.''The divisiveness referred specifically to a glossy poster put out by the Midstate School Finance Consortium, a group of upstate school districts. In bold letters, the poster states, ''Unfortunately, Some Kids Just Don't Get it,'' while each corner of the poster features a picture of a fifth-grade child and the cost of an education in his or her district. The costs and districts selected include: $9,851 in Nyack, on the Hudson; $4,973 in Sherburne-Earlville, a rural district south of Utica; $7,291 in Niagara Falls and $16,668 in Port Jefferson. Gary D. Bixhorn, the superintendent of Eastern Suffolk Boces and the chairman of the committee that drafted the Long Island report, said, ''Quite a few people were upset about the implications of that poster.'' The report states that while the average per-pupil expenditure on Long Island is $13,842, when that figure is adjusted by a cost-of-living index, the figure drops to $9,136, which is below the state median for regionally adjusted pupil expenditures.But long before serious debate begins over where new education spending will come from and how it will be disbursed among the state's many school districts, state and local officials must first resolve budget questions for the 2004-05 fiscal year.Long Island school officials said they were hopeful that negotiations on this year's budget and on a new state aid formula would go smoothly. Unlike in past years when Mr. Pataki has proposed major cuts to school aid, forcing state legislators to fight to restore funding, the governor this year has proposed a 1 percent increase -- an additional $147 million -- in education dollars.Long Island educators said, though, that with salary, pension and insurance payments going up by as much as 8 percent, many school districts will be forced to raise property taxes again unless state legislators can extract more money out of the state budget for schools.''We're certainly in a better position this year than we were a year ago, when we faced very heavy, drastic cuts,'' said Mark Schissler, superintendent of the Central Islip schools. ''But from our perspective a flat budget from the state is really a negative one because of increases that are out of our control. And if we don't see it from the state, then it gets borne by the individual homeowner.''Superintendents also said that the governor's proposal to use revenue from video lottery terminals, which will start appearing next month at racetracks across the state, to pay for new school aid also provided a promising start to discussions on a new state aid formula. For one thing, they said, it makes clear that the governor intends to find new revenue to increase school spending in high-need districts.

3483	 1999	a	Experimental restoration of the gray wolf to Montana, Idaho and Wyoming has been so successful since 1995, Federal officials say, that the first steps toward a single, integrated wolf population in the Northern Rockies have now been taken.In the Yellowstone area, where wolves have been most visible to wildlife enthusiasts, there are now about 110 adult wolves and roughly 60 newborn pups organized into 11 or 12 packs, said Edward E. Bangs, a biologist with the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service who heads the Northern Rockies recovery program. The wilderness of central Idaho is home to at least 12 packs with about 115 adults and 60 to 65 pups.Canadian wolves were introduced to these two areas in 1995 and 1996, and natural reproduction has steadily expanded their populations since then.In addition, 8 packs with about 60 adults and some 50 pups now inhabit northwestern Montana as a result of natural southward expansion of wolves from Canada that began in the mid-1980's.

2869	 2002	a	As he took to the podium for the last time in the Blue Room, the chamber in the west wing of City Hall where news conferences are held, Mr. Giuliani did something truly unusual: he praised the reporters who have covered him and sparred with him for the past eight years.''I'll have very, very warm memories of all the battles that I had in this room,'' he said. He allowed himself a few reminiscences: ''I'm thinking about all the times I said, 'That's jerky.' ''Then Mr. Giuliani, who is still married to Donna Hanover, was asked if there might be wedding bells in the future for him and his very good friend, Judith Nathan, who attended the news conference.''You guys are unbelievable,'' he said.Then he expanded. ''I think that I'm going to do the best I can to keep my personal life as personal as possible -- not that I succeeded at that very well in the last eight years,'' he said. ''Judith and I are very, very close. We love each other. And then we'll describe all the rest of it when it's appropriate to do.''When he was asked if he would grant his successor, Michael R. Bloomberg, some kind of grace period before criticizing him or his policies, Mr. Giuliani said that he did not think it would be necessary to do so.He went on to point out that one of his predecessors, Edward I. Koch, had instituted the idea of a grace period when he was succeeded by David N. Dinkins, and joked that Mr. Koch sometimes seemed to be counting the days until he could start criticizing. He even impersonated Mr. Koch and his criticisms, using a loud, nasal voice to say: ''That's ridiculous! How could he do that? I would never do that.''Then, last evening, he and Ms. Nathan walked out of his office in City Hall, applauded by aides and serenaded by bagpipers from the Police and Fire Departments. They shook hands and hugged and kissed staff members. Then they walked out the door, across the street, and down to a platform that had been erected on Fulton Street where people could view the site of the twin towers.Finally, it was off to Times Square. There, minutes after the ball drop at the beginning of the new year, Mr. Giuliani administered the oath of office to Mr. Bloomberg. With that, he began his new life as former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
2508	 2004	a	The Italian police detained seven executives and advisers of Parmalat on Wednesday and were seeking an eighth, significantly widening the investigation of events that led to the company's collapse under about $11 billion of liabilities.Police in Bologna, near Parmalat's headquarters outside Parma in north-central Italy, were holding two former chief financial officers, Fausto Tonna and Luciano del Soldato, as well as a company lawyer and two of its auditors from the firm Grant Thornton. The police were also seeking the head of Parmalat's operations in Venezuela, Giovanni Bonici, though his lawyers said he was out of the country but would turn himself in to the authorities upon his return.The police are holding the men at the request of magistrates who are investigating the circumstances of the failure of Parmalat, which sought protection from creditors earlier this month.Earlier on Wednesday, a representative of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission met with the magistrates as well as with the new chairman of Parmalat, Enrico Bondi, to discuss efforts to salvage some of the company's assets, which include dairy products, fruit juices and baked goods, and to devise a strategy for discovering what individuals or institutions might have made themselves culpable of defrauding investors by masking the company's true state.
4864	 1991	a	TENNIS Top 3 Lose in Paris Stefan Edberg, Boris Becker and Jim Courier -- the three highest-seeded players in the Paris Open -- were eliminated yesterday in the third round, but Courier moved up to No. 2 in the world ranking despite his loss. Boris Becker, seeded second, withdrew from the tournament because of the flu. He will be No. 3 when the next computer ranking of the Association of Tennis Professionals is released. Michael Chang was a 2-6, 6-1, 6-4 winner over Edberg, who is the defending champion and who is ranked No. 1. Omar Camporese beat the third-seeded Courier, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3. In the best match of the day, Pete Sampras outgunned Goran Ivanisevic, 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-5), in a battle of booming services. Ivanisevic had 26 aces, but none in the deciding tie breaker.

3833	 1997	a	Call it an art diaspora. More than $1 billion worth of ceramics, bronzes, furniture, paintings and porcelains have been flowing out of Hong Kong recently, because residents fear that China may restrict the export of art and antiques after it takes control from Britain on July 1. Chinese officials have said nothing to quell owners' anxieties.Hong Kong's art collectors are not selling their treasures now, for the most part. Rather, they are sending them for safe-keeping to second homes and art warehouses, especially in Canada and the United States. Or, they are giving them to museums on long-term loans.The exodus is driving up prices for Chinese art. And it is hastening the decline of Hong Kong and the rise of New York as the center of the China art trade. JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI
2252	 2006	a	American and Iraqi soldiers rolling up in Humvees were pelted with rocks by children. One American soldier pointed an assault rifle with a grenade launcher at the children to try scaring them off. Men and boys screamed out slurs about the Americans and the new Iraqi government.“Look at this chaos, look at this mess,” said a militia leader who gave his name as Yahir Abu Ali, black prayer beads in one hand and a cigarette in the other. “You see these poor people? They’ve lost their means of living because of this.”Karim Nasser, a fruit merchant sweating in a beige robe, waved wildly at the twisted metal debris of his stall. “A lorry filled with apples was trying to cross over the median when it exploded,” he said. “I lost my stall; it was the only source of income for my family.”PhotoThe bombing was the deadliest in Iraq since early April, when three suicide bombers blew themselves up in a prominent Shiite mosque here, killing scores of worshippers. The explosion on Saturday occurred around 10 a.m. in the Sadr City neighborhood of Baghdad, a vast, fetid enclave of 2.5 million people who mostly follow Moktada al-Sadr, the radical Shiite cleric. The attack was likely to provoke more sectarian bloodshed, for Sadr City is the home base of the thousands-strong Mahdi Army militia, which rose up against the Americans twice in 2004 and often clashes with Sunni Arab fighters.Mahdi militiamen rampaged through eastern Baghdad and other areas of Iraq after the February bombing of a sacred Shiite shrine, leaving hundreds dead.A Sadr official, Abdul Zahira al-Suweidi, said in a telephone interview that the American occupiers were ultimately to blame for the explosion rather than militant Sunnis. “Yesterday, we asked the government for a timetable for the withdrawal of the occupation forces,” he said. “As long as they stay, terrorist activities will increase.”Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.The bombing came shortly after, Tayseer Najah al-Mashhadani, a new parliamentarian, and 8 of her guards were kidnapped while driving into Baghdad from her provincial home north of the capital. An official from Ms. Mashhadani’s party, citing a bodyguard who managed to escape, said militiamen operating a checkpoint in eastern Baghdad pulled everyone from the cars at gunpoint and dragged them away.Since officially taking charge of Iraq in May, the new prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, has had to grapple with spiraling sectarian violence and rising hostility in the face of electricity and water shortages during 120-degree days. Mr. Maliki announced in early June the start of a broad security plan for Baghdad that involved deploying at least 50,000 Iraqi policemen and soldiers into the streets and increasing the number of checkpoints. The bloodletting has continued unabated, though, with bombings punctuating the sweltering summer days and tortured bodies turning up in alleyways, riverbanks and abandoned factories.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyNor has the brutality of this war lessened to any noticeable degree since the killing of Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in an American airstrike in early June.While Mr. Zarqawi was alive, American commanders often attributed suicide bombings such as the one in Sadr City to him and his organization, Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. Soon after Mr. Zarqawi’s death, American military officials said jihadists had anointed a new leader for Al Qaeda here, Abu Ayyub al-Masri, an Egyptian explosives expert trained in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The State Department announced on Friday a reward of $5 million for any information leading to Mr. Masri.The speaker of the Iraqi Parliament, from the same tribe as Tayseer al-Mashhadani, issued a statement Saturday afternoon condemning Ms. Mashhadani’s kidnapping and demanding her immediate release. Ms. Mashhadani belongs to the Iraqi Islamic Party, a conservative Sunni Arab group that has often criticized the Shiite-led security forces and the American presence. The party’s leader, Tarik al-Hashemi, is one of the country’s two vice-presidents.Ms. Mashhadani was driving into Baghdad for a Parliament meeting when she was stopped at a checkpoint by armed men in civilian clothes, said Hamdi Hassoun, a party official in Diyala Province, where Ms. Mashhadani lives. “They aimed their guns at the heads of the bodyguards and confiscated their guns and cell phones,” Mr. Hassoun said, adding that one guard managed to escape. The abduction took place in the Shaab district of Baghdad, a restive area where sectarian violence is rampant.
4588	 1992	a	On a mild day in March, a stroller in Vienna's Volksgarten (People's Garden) notices that the ravens are suddenly missing from their posts in the trees. Their departure to Russia anticipates the end of the gloomy Danubian winter. Because of the ravens, some Viennese birdwatchers prefer to visit this small park in winter, but given its central location, the Volksgarten is truly a park for all hours and seasons.Built in the 1820's on the spot where Napoleon's retreating army removed a fortification from the city's glacis, the Volksgarten is refined as parks go, holding nature at a distance. The grass is off-limits, but visitors can walk along the maze of paths, admiring the rose garden, examining the neoclassical Temple of Theseus and pausing at the monument to the beloved Empress Elisabeth, who was assassinated in 1898 in Geneva. In one corner is a small, octagon-shaped pavilion where coffee and cake are served outside once the weather is predictably nice.Opening off the Volksgarten, and spatially part of it, is the Heldenplatz (Heroes' Square), from which one can look onto the greatest panorama in all Vienna: the Burgtheater, a corner of the neo-Renaissance University, the neo-Gothic steeple of the Rathaus (City Hall), the racing chariots atop the Parliament and, straight ahead, the domes of the Fine Arts and Natural History museums. On the Heldenplatz you can lie in the large tracts of grass among the lilac bushes and wonder at how much sky is visible from the center of a city.

5221	 1988	a	Mr. Diehl appeared as a knight in shining armor in the accounts of the decision to get tough. But local environmentalists say a dose of political jousting probably also played a role.Complaints about the chimney, which has stood since well before World War II, started rolling in about 11 years ago, when the politically powerful Association of Polish Cooperatives decided to build a 10-story office building across from the smokestack. When employees of the cooperative open their windows wide, they get a desk full of soot, even though some are about 150 feet from the chimney.Even more important, the factory lies several hundred yards from the Polish Army medical academy, which trains doctors for the elite military hospitals that treat Communist Party functionaries.Stefan Samborski, deputy director of Delta and the villain to opponents of the smokestack, explained wearily that the company's management could not have installed the chimney filters even if it had wanted to.''Four, five years ago we installed cyclones to clean the smoke,'' he said in a conversation at Delta headquarters. ''In the first period, the cyclones functioned well. But they do not eliminate the sulfur. But the means are not at our disposal to resolve the problem.'' A Lack of Western CurrencyThat, he explained, is because Poland does not produce the scrubbers the chimney needs, and the only ones available are made by a West German-Brazilian company that sells them for convertible Western currency.Convertible currency purchases for any equipment can only be made through a central ministry in Warsaw. Delta has repeatedly requested such purchases, Mr. Samborski said, but the ministry has responded that because Poland is so heavily indebted, it does not have the required cash.

5336	 1988	a	The ''L'' word wasn't dirty in at least one place last night - the annual Liberal Party dinner.Governor Cuomo told up to 700 Democrats and Liberals that ''liberalism properly understood is not just consistent with the American idea; liberalism properly understood is the American idea.''The Governor was attending his first Liberal Party dinner in several years after a rapprochement with the party leadership. He made an unusually serious speech for such a noisy political dinner, attacking ''the grubby campaign of slander that the Republicans have waged trying to fool the American people.'' He assailed the Republicans for ''cheap efforts to distort'' liberalism.With Republican distortions, he said, ''freedom means permissiveness, liberty means license, privacy is pornography, progress becomes chaos, government means intrusion and conciliation means weakness.'' 'Celebrating the Liberal Policies'The Governor echoed other speakers, including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Arthur Schlesinger, the historian, and Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, in ''celebrating the liberal policies that have made this country great,'' in the words of Fran Reiter, vice chairman of the Liberal Party.
3786	 1997	a	There are logical reasons why composers are regularly honored with centenary (and multi-centenary) tributes, but performers' centenaries are rarely celebrated. A composer's work, after all, takes on a life independent of its creator; a performer's art is personal expression. Without the performer on hand, what is there?Carnegie Hall wrestled with this question on Thursday evening in a tribute to Marian Anderson, who would have been 100 years old on Feb. 17. The concert was part of a larger tribute that includes an exhibition of memorabilia from her career in the hall's Rose Museum and a teachers' workshop that was held last weekend.Anderson's career had a special dimension, of course: it was inextricably linked to a historical current, the struggle for civil rights in the first half of this century. She was often described as a reluctant symbol, and one can appreciate that: her triumphant 1939 concert at the Lincoln Memorial, after all, came after being banned from Constitution Hall. The entire episode was itself a symbol of Anderson's ability to prevail over countless other humiliations.But a powerful and lasting symbol it was, and it became a leitmotif on Thursday, when several of Anderson's colleagues offered both personal anecdotes and stories with a broader historical sweep between performances of works associated with her. Isaac Stern began with a celebratory overview, and Rita Dove, the poet, spoke of Anderson's influence on her. It seemed, early on, as if hagiography would overwhelm music as a focus of the evening, something I suspect Anderson would have regretted.

5359	 1988	a	Mr. Salinas will be sworn in at the Mexican Congress, where in August and September enraged opposition legislators sought to prevent his certification as the country's President-elect. After nearly a month of heated debates and occasional fistfights, however, Mr. Salinas's victory in the July 6 balloting, with a bare majority of 50.7 percent of the vote, was made official.Opposition parties of the right and left continue to maintain that they were deprived of millions of votes and that Mr. Salinas is coming to office illegitimately. But negotiations aimed at preventing incidents during the inauguration ceremonies ended with both opposition blocs being permitted to state their positions before Mr. Salinas enters the legislative chamber.New doubts about Mr. Salinas's commitment to political change were raised this afternoon when Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, Governor of the state of Veracruz, was named Secretary of the Interior. That post, whose responsibilities include supervision of the state police and security apparatus, is the most politically influential and sensitive in the Cabinet. Mr. Gutierrez Barrios, 61, headed the federal police in 1968 when army and security forces fired on student protestors here, killing more than 250 people, and he continues to be regarded as a hard-liner with no particular devotion to civil liberties. Minister Stays in CabinetIn a break with tradition, Mr. Salinas retained Manuel Bartlett Diaz, the current Interior Minister and his chief rival last year for the ruling party's presidential nomination, in the Cabinet, this time as Education Minister. Opposition leaders accused Mr. Bartlett of engineering the electoral fraud they say took place in July, and the choice is likely to be as controversial as that of Mr. Guitierrez Barrios.As Foreign Minister, Mr. Salinas chose Fernando Solana, who is currently director of the Banco Nacional de Mexico and who has served previously as both Education and Commerce Ministers. Though the post of ambassador to Washington is not yet filled, advisers to Mr. Salinas said the choice of Gustavo Petricioli, the current Finance Minister, was probable.

925	 2013	a	Dear Diary:A motorcycle story from 1963.I wanted to make a chandelier from a wagon wheel. The problem was finding a wagon wheel.I was driving my motorcycle and I saw a man driving a horse cart. I asked if he knew where I could get a wagon wheel. He said to follow him and we went to his stable in East Harlem, about 110th Street near the East River. So I gave him $10 and took the wheel.It was two and half feet in diameter with an iron rim and hub, and weighed over 75 pounds. I strapped it to the rack of my motorcycle and drove off. You can imagine it was pretty large and heavy, balanced on the back.As I was driving home, a cabby pulled up next to me and said, “Hey buddy, got a spare?”Read all recent entries and our updated submissions guidelines.

3559	 1999	a	BUSINESS travelers worldwide are increasingly embracing the Internet to research and book their flights, an annual survey by the International Air Transport Association has found.Almost two-thirds of the survey's approximately 1,000 respondents from Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region said they used the Internet to find flight information, a 50 percent increase over the survey's results from two years ago. In some cases IATA compares the current results with year-earlier figures, in others with figures from 1997.Not surprisingly, North American business travelers -- who made up approximately one-third of the group surveyed -- were the heaviest users of the Internet for flight research; 70 percent of this group said they went on-line to do research, an increase of 27 percent over 1997. Such use grew at an even greater rate among European travelers (an increase of 68 percent over 1997) and Asian travelers (an increase of 63 percent).Over all, the number of travelers using the Internet to actually book a trip has almost doubled, from 9 percent in IATA's 1998 poll to 17 percent this year. One in 10 of those surveyed said they made flight reservations online weekly, one-fifth use the Internet monthly to book, while almost 40 percent make online bookings every few months.

1380	 2011	a	Patrick Mcdermott/Getty ImagesThere’s a stereotype of tennis — fair or not — that it is a gentlemen’s sport. The players, like the game itself, are supposed to be polite and mild-mannered individuals with affluent backgrounds.Alex Bogomolov is not like that. And he knows it.“I grew up differently,” he said. “I’m not the uptight tennis player most people think of.”Bogomolov, who lost in men’s doubles Thursday, will take the court again Friday against Rogerio Dutra da Silva of Brazil in the second round of men’s singles. He defeated Steve Johnson, with whom he has played doubles in the past, in the first round Wednesday.“I didn’t do too many things well besides mentally give myself a chance to stay in the match,” Bogomolov said. “The good thing is, I always fight through the adversity.”That resiliency is rooted in his upbringing. Russian immigrants, his family did not live the lavish lifestyle his tennis peers enjoyed. Instead, he had a passionate father, also named Alex, who was a prominent tennis player in the Soviet Union and went on to become a successful coach.When he was 9, the Bogomolovs moved to Mexico, then two years later to Miami, where Bogomolov Sr. ran a tennis academy.Bogomolov Jr. and his sister also took to tennis and were coached by their father, and his sister’s traveling schedule led Bogomolov Sr. to go on the road much of the year. To continue developing as a player, an 11-year-old Bogomolov was sent to Brooklyn to work with a friend of his father. Over the next decade, Bogomolov spent half the year in Brooklyn and the other half in Miami, honing his game.In New York, Bogomolov and his friends attended the Open each summer but never paid for a ticket; they would find a way to sneak in. The group would look for fights, and at 16, Bogomolov landed in a holding cell after he was arrested for fighting at the Port Washington Tennis Academy. Still, Bogomolov takes pride in his upbringing.“I feel like everybody wanted to prove to the others that we got each other’s backs,” Bogomolav said. “It was just the way it was.”Bogomolov’s resiliency has been tested more than in just Wednesday’s match.First, there was the pressure of not living up to the expectations as a top junior player.Then there was a messy divorce from the tennis player Ashley Harkleroad, whom he married when he was 21 and divorced two years later.“I was in debt for a long time because of it,” he said. “I would have a good result, pay off some of the debt, then not do so well. I never had any momentum.”Another blow came in 2008. During an event in South Korea, Bogomolov fell on his wrist, but felt no pain and went on to win the match. He woke up the next day unable to move the wrist. A doctor’s visit revealed he had torn ligaments.“It was like a knockout punch,” Bogomolov said.Bogomolov was told he might never be able to use a two-handed backhand again. Then came a break that he said changed his life. A week after returning from Korea, he met Luana Goncalves at a car convention in Miami. The two remained in contact and in the week leading up to his surgery in January 2009 he stayed in New Jersey with Goncalves, who moved to the United States from Brazil as a child.After surgery, Bogomolov took a job as a consultant for a tennis academy in New York with hopes of getting back on the court. But rehabbing did not go as well as expected, and he could not hit a ball without pain.Then he got some unexpected news.“I came back from work one day and she told me she was pregnant,” Bogomolov said of Goncalves. “A week after that, I was hitting full-on backhands. It was a miracle because before that I couldn’t even hit a backhand.”With another mouth to feed, Bogomolov knew he had to get back on the court to make some money.“He realized that it was now or never,” Goncalves said.Three months later, in June 2009, he was back on tour. He lost in last year’s United States Open qualifying tournament, but qualified for every Grand Slam event this year, advancing to the third round of Wimbledon in June. At 28, when most players are on the decline, Bogomolov is now ranked 44th, the highest in his career.He credits his son, Maddox, now 20 months old, and Goncalves for putting him in line.“I don’t get out of hand like I used to,” he said. “After a loss, I would get drunk and depressed. With her it was a big issue we had to change. Right away she changed that. She wouldn’t let me do that. I would pout and she would tell me to change my mentality.”

4716	 1992	a	To the Editor:"Boon to Anglers Turns Into a Disaster for Lakes and Streams" (Science Times, Nov. 17), on the claim that fish-stocking programs may in some cases harm rare species, lacks perspective. Anglers have always been at the forefront of efforts to conserve native fishes and fish habitats. Fish stocking is a small part of restoring fish populations and fishing to what it once was.Land around water is so heavily developed, and water is such a heavily used resource, that practically all aquatic ecosystems are heavily disturbed and suffer from loss of diversity. Game fish, being at the top of the food pyramid, suffer most from this loss of diversity. Fish-stocking programs are a feeble effort to restore native populations or to provide nonnative populations in areas that can no longer support native fishes.Examples of these efforts include stocking striped bass in the Hudson River to mitigate losses because of power plants, and the introduction of brown trout into waters that have become too warm and silted for native brook trout. These efforts are hardly a boon to recreational anglers.It is not clear that the few problems you indicate for native fish result from stocking. For example, you cite small mouth bass as an obstacle to reintroduction of Atlantic salmon by stocking, but Atlantic salmon once coexisted with bass in many watersheds. Lake trout in the Great Lakes are devastated by the sea lamprey, introduced through the St. Lawrence Seaway, but are little affected by introduction of Pacific salmon.

1786	 2009	a	Photo“Before Tomorrow” is set in 1840 at the perilous moment when white explorers with their strange customs and implements began encroaching on the far north territory occupied by Inuit tribes that had little or no contact with the outside world. This visually transfixing movie is the third in a trilogy that began with the ancient Inuit folk tale “The Fast Runner” (“Atanarjuat”) and continued with “The Journals of Knud Rasmussen,” set in the early 1920s.Directed by Marie-Hélène Cousineau and Madeline Piujuq Ivalu and based on a novel by the Danish writer Jorn Riel, the movie is a product of Arnait Video Productions, the Women’s Video Workshop of Igloolik. It is the only film in this series to focus on women’s roles as storytellers and repositories of folk wisdom; its perspective might be described as Inuit feminist.The film’s benign, nurturing ethos is accentuated by the contribution of the French-Canadian singer-songwriters Kate and Anna McGarrigle, whose searching folk ballad “Why Must We Die?” bookends the film. The lyrics, which begin, “We are meat, we are spirit/We have blood and we have grace,” evoke an ideal balance of flesh and spirit within a culture in harmony with nature in which the living seek counsel from the dead. Although it is one of the McGarrigles’ finest songs, the imposition of a contemporary folk ballad still doesn’t quite mesh with the film’s portrayal of an insular, in some ways prehistoric culture that even as late as 1840 had changed little over many centuries.Where “The Fast Runner,” the most powerful film of the trilogy, told a tough tale of dissension within a tribe, “Before Tomorrow” succumbs to ethnographic sentimentality in its idyllic depiction of the same world threatened by evil from outside. It tells the story of Ningiuq (Ms. Piujuq Ivalu), a wise old woman, who, with her lifetime friend Kutuujuk (Mary Qulitalik) and 10-year-old grandson, Maniq (Paul-Dylan Ivalu), is transported by kayak to a remote island to spend the final weeks of a bountiful summer drying salmon and caribou meat for the coming winter.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyTales have already circulated within the community about white strangers who have a taste for a fiery liquid that makes them dance and then fall down and who carry sharp sewing needles and wield knives made from a hard substance. Ningiuq is intuitively suspicious of possible contamination from strangers.

4925	 1990	a	In recent years, a dramatic change in attitude toward bankruptcy has occurred within the legal profession and the corporate world. Bankruptcy was once considered a second-rate specialty, like criminal and labor law. Almost exclusively devoted to holding demanding creditors at bay, the practice was disdained by the white-shoe firms; company managers viewed bankruptcy as a humiliating last resort. But, as a result of innovative lawyering, bankruptcy courts have become forums for airing product-liability problems and labor disputes. Chapter 11 has become a refuge for solvent companies such as A. H. Robins, maker of the Dalkon Shield, and the Manville Corporation, the asbestos manufacturer, whose products have injured customers and produced an onslaught of potentially ruinous law suits. Other companies, such as Continental Airlines and Eastern Air Lines, have availed themselves of the bankruptcy laws to break unions. Bankruptcy has thus become a sword as much as a shield. And no lawyer has wielded the sword more aggressively than Harvey Miller.''Bankruptcy,'' Miller said in a recent speech in Houston, ''is like dancing with an 800 pound gorilla. You dance as long as the gorilla wants to dance.'' Typically, the bankruptcy process involves anunpredictable conflict between the company's management and committees recognized by the court to represent creditors and shareholders. Participants on both sides have their own batteries of lawyers, investment bankers and accountants.''Bankruptcy practice now means one-third litigation, one-third negotiation and one-third mergers and acquisitions,'' says Wilbur L. Ross Jr., a senior managing director and bankruptcy specialist at the investment banking firm of Rothschild Inc. The committees can play pivotal roles in reshaping the business. They can challenge pre-bankruptcy transactions as improper conveyances that have been executed to defraud them. Their views are solicited on sales of assets, plans for liquidation and the valuations of the new company or its individual parts. And they can seek to have management thrown out in favor of a court-appointed trustee.In the war over control of a company in Chapter 11, the first round of battle can take place outside the bankruptcy courthouse. Fearing that Pennzoil might ask Texas state courts to start seizing Texaco's assets to satisfy a $10.5 billion judgment, Miller had two associates - armed with bankruptcy papers and a walkie talkie shadow two Federal bankruptcy judges in New York over a period of months. Ultimately, Miller went with a battery of Texaco lawyers to Judge Howard Schwartzberg's house in Larchmont, N.Y., on a Sunday morning in April 1987 and personally delivered the bankruptcy petition. By beating Pennzoil to the courts, Miller took the first step in keeping his client in control of the bankruptcy process.The toughest battle is usually over who gets to file a plan of reorganization. because this will determine who among the creditors and shareholders gets paid, and how much, and what form the company will assume after emerging from bankruptcy. At the outset of the bankruptcy proceeding, management has what is known as a period of exclusivity lasting 120 days, during which it alone may propose the reorganization plan. A bankruptcy judge has wide discretion in deciding whether to extend exclusivity.A SLIGHT, NASAL TONE in his speech gives a clue to Harvey Miller's Brooklyn roots. Born in 1933, the second of two sons of a wood-flooring salesman, he grew up in the working-class Gravesend section. The first in his family to go beyond high school, Miller graduated from Brooklyn College in 1954 after majoring in political science. Following a two- year army stint during which he was posted to Germany, he entered Columbia Law School and, after graduation in 1959, took a job with F. E .M. Ballon, a small law firm with a general practice. After a few months, he inherited the Chapter 11 proceeding of Wise Shops, a large retail company.''I loved it,'' he recalls. But in his next bankruptcy case, he arrived at a hearing only to discover that his opponent was Charles Seligson, a professor at New York University School of Law, who was widely regarded as a leading scholar in the field. ''I was trembling in my boots,'' Miller says. ''The judge stepped down from the bench, shook Seligson's hand and said, 'Professor, what an honor to see you.' ''

4544	 1993	a	The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum paid posthumous tribute yesterday to Oskar Schindler, the German industrialist and Nazi Party member who saved the lives of 1,300 Jews in the Holocaust.At a ceremony in the museum, in Washington, the Medal of Remembrance was presented to his widow, EMILIE SCHINDLER, 84, who worked with her husband to rescue Jews from concentration camps and to shelter many in a bogus munitions factory. Steven Spielberg has made the story into the film "Schindler's List," which opens Dec. 15.MILES LERMAN, the chairman of the museum council, said Mr. Schindler, who died in 1974, was a "most unlikely candidate" to save so many Jews. He described Mr. Schindler, a bon vivant, as someone whose original ambition had been "to make lots and lots of money." He said, "He had everything to gain from the Nazis." Instead, he risked his freedom and depleted his fortune.Mr. Spielberg, another of the speakers, recounted how Mrs. Schindler once discovered a boxcar full of victims of the Nazis. They all appeared to have frozen to death, but still she combed through the bodies. She found 30 people who were barely alive and nursed them back to health.

5565	 1986	a	A Federal district judge issued a preliminary injunction today halting the program that pays dairy operators to slaughter their cattle. It also orders the Department of Agriculture to limit the number of animals sent to market.The action grew out of a lawsuit filed in April by beef cattle producers' associations and individual producers from Texas and Montana.The suit said the program, designed to reduce dairy herds and cut surplus milk production, had cost the cattle industry $25 million in lost revenue in the first week of April and cut the value of cattle on inventory by $2 billion.In addition to issuing the preliminary injunction, the judge, Halbert O. Woodward, ordered that the Department of Agriculture immediately prepare regulations to specify marketing procedures to limit the total dairy cattle marked for slaughter to no more than 7 percent of the national dairy herd each year.

12808	 1934	a	With the close of business yesterday, the Federal Treasury ended the first three-quarters of the current fiscal year with a deficit of about $2,500,000,000. In round numbers this is an increase of $1,350,000,000 since Jan. 1. If the deficit should continue to increase at the same rate during the next three months, it would amount at the end of the fiscal year in June to a little less than $4,000,000,000.

1837	 2008	a	As a special treat for readers of The Moment, the power gallerist Emmanuel Perrotin writes about new exhibitions in Paris.Yesterday night was the opening of the “La Louvre – Paris” exhibition by Gelitin, the four-man art collective, at the Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (ARC). The Museum was packed. A fashiony and artsy crowd was hanging out at the entrance and inside the museum.The group known as Gelitin, from Vienna, took over an entire floor of the museum. They filled the space that the museum gave them with more than 3,000 artworks, from big installations, to small pieces, exhibited from the floor to ceiling. Broken walls, toilets, photographs of men half naked, piles of chairs, pipes, stuffed animals, real birds — this is the world of Gelitin. A whole room is filled with paintings made with modeling clay: a re-visitation of masterpieces referencing Paris: La Joconde (Leonardo da Vinci), etc. See above.A large band of artistic friends took part in the creation of some works. After being overwhelmed by the vision of all these works (paintings, sculptures, installation, drawings knitting works, photos.), I started to detect the smell of caramel and cheese, which were used to make some of the works on display. Cheese, like caramel, was coated on to a sculpture: the smell was very strong as the room was getting warmer and full of visitors.The world of Gelitin could be defined as an enormous extravagant chaotic and proliferating universe. It is difficult to describe the work with a few adjectives. I am very enthusiastic with this exhibition and its dynamic, colorful, unpredictable and unique in its style. I was leaving the museum while a band was performing in front of an extravagant and flamboyant crowd.“La Louvre – Paris,” Musée de la ville de Paris, exhibition on view from March 1st to April 20th, 2008.

2519	 2004	a	''The biggest surprise was the return of the public to the market,'' said Andrew Engel, senior research analyst at the Leuthold Group, a market research and money management firm in Minneapolis. And, he added, ''this was one of the big reasons for the rally.''He said that he had expected it to take much longer for investors to regain confidence in stocks. But he said it now appeared that investors have become conditioned to thinking of the longer term and are willing, therefore, to jump back into the market quickly.Abby Joseph Cohen, the head of the investment policy group at Goldman, Sachs, said that she saw signs that showed that some investors were still being cautious. But she added that the positive economic environment right now had made investors more willing to make bets that many companies with weak earnings now will do better in the future.''When inflation and interest rates are low investors have more confidence in the durability of the economic cycle and are willing to extend their expectations for the economy and for the earnings of a particular company,'' she said.Besides the big 2003 gains, investors also got a much less volatile market. Last year there were just 15 days on which the Dow rose or fell 2 percent or more, compared with 48 in 2002, 25 in 2001 and 31 in 2000, according to Scanshift, a Chicago research firm.While there is no unanimity, many forecasters expect the stock market to continue to rise this year, but at a much slower pace. Mr. Engel of the Leuthold Group and Ms. Clayman of New Amsterdam Partners say they expect 10 percent growth in the S.&P. 500.''The discordant thing is that the big winners have been the low quality stocks and the low-priced stocks,'' Ms. Clayman said. ''In order for the rally in these stocks to be justified you have to continue to see 20 percent to 30 percent earnings growth.''
249	 2018	a	HONG KONG — Two Malaysian women accused of pursuing a sexual relationship were caned in an Islamic court on Monday, setting off an outcry from rights groups that said the country’s political transformation this year had done little to ensure equal treatment of all citizens.The women, who were convicted of “sexual relations between women,” were each struck six times with a rattan cane in front of witnesses in the Shariah High Court in the state of Terengganu, officials said.The sentence, delivered four months after an election that saw Malaysia’s governing party ousted for the first time since the country was founded in 1957, reflects the country’s deeply conservative culture despite a liberalization in its politics.Rights groups assailed the new government for discrimination against gay men and lesbians and for continuing to allow a form of corporal punishment outlawed in most of the world.

3679	 1998	a	One of the early successes of American diplomacy in the region was persuading Ukraine to give up its nuclear arsenal, which was the second-largest in the Soviet Union after Russia's.Washington has sent about $250 million in aid a year to Ukraine in an effort to insure its independence and bolster its economy, an amount that has made Ukraine the third-largest recipient of American foreign aid.The Clinton Administration has justified the assistance by asserting that it would be difficult for Russia to become an imperial power again without Ukraine falling back into its clutches.But foreign investors, citing rampant corruption, have largely stayed away from Ukraine -- the country has attracted a paltry $2 billion in outside direct investment. Industry and agriculture remain almost entirely state-run.But under President Kuchma, Washington says, Ukraine has followed through on two important counts.First, Mr. Kuchma is ambivalent -- but unlike Russia not hostile -- to NATO expansion. And this spring he agreed, under pressure from Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, to cancel the sale of two turbines destined for a nuclear reactor in Iran. That made Ukraine's record on deterring the spread of nuclear arms much better than Russia's.In canceling the sale of the turbines, Mr. Kuchma found an effective negotiating tactic with Washington.Publicly, Mr. Kuchma has complained that his country was not compensated sufficiently for the loss of the $45 million order or for the loss of other commercial opportunities in Iran. Privately, Mr. Kuchma has told Washington that Ukraine should be rewarded for the cancellation in ''units of I.M.F. funding,'' a Clinton Administration official said.

1135	 2012	a	Kostas Tsironis/Bloomberg NewsThe restructuring of Greece’s debt that is scheduled to start next week may well demonstrate how effective credit-default swaps are.These financial instruments, which played a major role in both the 2008 financial crisis and in the European debt crisis, are meant to pay out if a company or country defaults. But the twists and turns over Greece’s debt are revealing their potential limitations for investors who hope the swaps will protect them against losses if Greece defaults.On Thursday, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, the industry body that decides whether swaps should pay out, said that Greece’s proposed debt exchange did not currently activate swaps linked to the country’s debt. But the association added that the swaps could activate at a later date.The body’s decision reignites the debate over the usefulness of the default swaps. If Greece had simply stopped paying interest or principal on its bonds, the swaps would have paid out. European policy makers, however, decided last year to try to use a voluntary debt exchange for Greece as a way to avoid setting off the swaps. The maneuver was a brusque reminder for investors that there are ways to circumvent the conditions of credit-default swaps.“If a sovereign, and those trying to rescue it, tiptoe around the periphery to avoid triggering the C.D.S., it may impair the effectiveness of the C.D.S. as a risk management tool,” said Bruce Bennett, a partner at the law firm Covington & Burling.If the Greek debt exchange damages the reputation of credit-default swaps, banks and other investors that make heavy use of them for protection from losses may have to consider other strategies.And it would add fuel to the political fire over the swaps and speculators. Some European politicians contend that the swaps destabilize financial markets and encourage investors to mount speculative attacks on government debt. European officials have even taken the step of setting up their own version of credit protection, which will be offered by the European Financial Stability Facility, a government-backed rescue fund.Just over $70 billion of default swaps exist on Greek government debt. After subtracting swaps that pay out on a default from those that get paid, the net amount is $3.25 billion. But the small net number masks how much is at stake if the swaps do not behave after Greece’s debt exchange as investors planned.One of the decisions of the swaps association on Thursday underscored how swaps can be disconnected from actions that harm investors’ economic interests. As part of the Greek debt deal, the European Central Bank will be shielded against losses on the Greek bonds it holds, a move that relegates, or subordinates, the claims of private creditors who hold the same bonds.But the swaps association said the plans to subordinate private creditors do not meet the definition of subordination in the swaps contracts, so they do not have to pay out. The association’s 15-member committee behind the decision consists of 10 banks that deal in derivatives and five asset management firms.Most analysts now believe that Greece will opt for an involuntary exchange, using a legal measure to force as many bondholders into the exchange as possible to maximize the country’s debt relief. As a result, many market participants believe the swaps will be set off.A voluntary exchange is still possible, however. If more than 90 percent of the bondholders entered the exchange voluntarily, Greece might decide it does not need to force more participation with the legal measure, called a collective action clause.But even if Greece does opt for an involuntary exchange and the swaps activate, the process may not work as planned. The exact amount paid out on the swaps is determined by an auction of Greek bonds. Yet the auction would almost certainly take place after the bonds had been included in the exchange and eradicated. Investors have to submit bonds registered under Greek law by Thursday.After the exchange, investors would have new Greek bonds, worth much less than their old bonds’ original value. But it is not clear whether these can be included in the default swaps auction, and, if they can, whether they would settle at the price investors hoped for.Some analysts say that the swaps association will most likely try to work out a solution so that the new bonds can be used in the auction.“I am convinced I.S.D.A. will come up with a mechanism,” said Rodrigo Olivares-Caminal, a lecturer in finance at the University of London who specializes in sovereign debt.If that option does not exist, another potential solution may be to use the small amount of Greek bonds that are registered under English law in the auction. Holders of these bonds may not submit them by Thursday. And they will not be subject to the collective action clause, which is only inserted in Greek law bonds.The English law bonds will almost certainly lose value, but they do not have to be submitted to Greece until April 11. That means some may theoretically be available for the default swap auction. Still, this option raises the question of what would happen if Greece did not have any English law bonds.Some analysts do not see anxiety in the market prices for Greek bonds and credit-default swaps. A big divergence between the two instruments would suggest investors are worried about their ability to activate the default swaps. But that is not happening, said Ed Lalanne, a strategist at Macro Risk Advisers.“The prices of sovereign C.D.S haven’t been condemning the market to be useless,” he said.

2935	 2002	a	The Justice Department arrested the head of an Islamic charity in Illinois today and said there was extensive evidence that he and his organization had close ties to Osama bin Laden and had secretly funneled money to his terrorist network, Al Qaeda.The man, Enaam M. Arnaout, 39, the Syrian-born director of the Benevolence International Foundation, was arrested at his home in the Chicago suburb of Justice and charged with lying under oath in documents his group had filed in federal court. The documents were part of a suit the group filed in January against the United States government after officials seized the foundation's assets as part of the investigations into the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.In seeking to have a court unfreeze the assets, Mr. Arnaout testified that the foundation was a ''faith-based humanitarian organization that engages in charitable work around the world'' and ''does not engage in or fund terrorist activity.''But in an affidavit given today by an F.B.I. agent to support its arrest warrant for Mr. Arnaout, the government provided an extraordinary amount of information it had collected, some of it dating back years before the Sept. 11 attacks, to support the accusation that the foundation was a front to finance terrorism around the world. The affidavit of Agent Robert Walker was rich in detail about the movement of money from the Islamic charities into what it said were the pockets of Al Qaeda operatives to pay for weapons and military training of terrorists in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Philippines, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Georgia and Chechnya.
6252	 1973	a	“But with the law of supply and demand,” he said in an interview “things have gradually let up, and the merchandise is being moved in the old amounts pnd the pushers are willing again to deal with strangers. We also understand that prices are up now.”Chief Taylor said the police had made an “effective start” toward enforcing the law. However, he said it would take another month or two—“when the pushers see what happens in the courts” — to determine the strength of the law as a deterrent.Before Sept. 1 police officials said that the new law would not result in a significant increase in drug arrests, because of the department's two‐year old policy of focusing on “quality” arrests that might result in the successful prosecution of “big dealers.”But many prosecutors and defense lawyers have been surprised by the size of the decline last month.“We've een a clear and substantial falloff in the number of cases we would pick up,” said Howard R. Meyer, supervisor of the narcotics division of the Legal Aid Society. “Maybe the pushers are moving out of state; maybe the police are turning their backs on some things. We don't know.”The possibility of conflict within the police force over, enforcement of the new law arose last week with the transfer of Capt. Jeremiah O'Connor, a commander of the narcotic division's Sixth District in Central Harlem.
5403	 1987	a	''It's so much beyond any expectation,'' said an ebullient Mr. Trump, who had said that he had hoped to just break even or turn a modest profit of about $100,000. ''This is a little different ending than most city stories.''Mr. Stern agreed that the rink was ''enormously successful.'' Record AdmissionsBut the Trump Organization still has a lot of negotiating to do with the city if it is to continue to operate the rink. Mr. Gliedman said the two sides are far apart on some key aspects of the proposed concession contract, such as its duration and the fate of the Lasker Rink in Central Park near 103d Street.The Trump Organization has asked for a 10-year agreement, Mr. Gliedman said, and the city has offered one for 4 years.Mr. Stern declined yesterday to discuss the negotiations. ''We have a lot of negotiating to do,'' he said.Mr. Trump took over the project in June 1986 after two city studies had concluded that the renovation was a failure. The city agreed to allow Mr. Trump to take over the project, with both agreeing that all profits would go to public works projects and charities suggested by city officials and approved by Mr. Trump.The project was completed two and a half months ahead of schedule and cost about $750,000 less than the $3 million that it was budgeted for.Mr. Stern said the profits came from an unexpectedly high turnout in the winter. He said that about 225,000 people bought the $4.50 admission tickets to the rink as of March 24. Mr. Gliedman said the Trump Organization believes an additional 25,000 people used the rink from March 24 to Monday.

3634	 1998	a	THE Devils live. They go to Ottawa for tomorrow night's sixth game. But even with their 3-1 victory last night, their future remains in jeopardy because their four-of-seven-game Stanley Cup playoff series remains a mystery: The Case of the Missing Goals.In finishing first in the Eastern Conference, the Devils scored 225 goals, a respectable ninth among National Hockey League teams. But in five games with eighth-seeded Ottawa, the Devils have scored only 11 goals, including one empty-net goal.To advance in the playoffs, the Devils will need Martin Brodeur at his best, as he was last night.Insisting, ''We do have the scorers,'' Coach Jacques Lemaire mentioned Doug Gilmour, Dave Andreychuk, Bobby Holik, Randy McKay, Steve Thomas, Brian Rolston, Patrik Elias, Jason Arnott and Brendan Morrison. But of that group, only Gilmour and Andreychuk had scored before Rolston's short-handed goal last night.Gilmour, with the clincher last night, now has five goals (including the empty-netter), Andreychuk one. Bobby Carpenter, Denis Pederson and two defensemen, Lyle Odelein last night and Scott Stevens, produced the other goals.

5950	 1982	a	Some 15 years ago a totally unknown young Scot made a name for himself with an excellent book on the subject of defense. Since then, a string of equally valuable books on advanced play have given Hugh Kelsey a well-deserved place in any list of the world's best bridge writers.His two latest offerings - ''Test Your Communications'' and ''Test Your Card-Reading'' - are in a series of monographs. Each provides the reader with 36 deals on which to exercise his talents, and, as usual in a Kelsey book, he is asked to study two hands before he has a chance to look at four. Each is available for $5.50 from the Bridge World, 39 West 94th Street, New York, N.Y. 10025.The diagramed deal, from the book on communication, would deceive most players of intermediate rank and perhaps a few sleepy experts. A normal auction leaves South playing in three no-trump, and the opening lead is the heart four. Many declarers would happily play a small heart from dummy to make sure of three tricks in the suit. They would indeed score those tricks, but that is not a key issue. If they took a little time to plan, they would realize this. Ace Must Do the WorkTo make nine tricks, South must develop one of the black suits, and clubs are distinctly more promising than spades. If South routinely plays low from dummy and wins East's heart queen with the ace, he can finesse the club jack. But when the ace does not collect the king, he is out of business: The diamond ace is the only entry to his hand, and he cannot use the clubs.

554	 2016	a	“Two Trains Runnin’,” Sam Pollard’s compact, resonant documentary — part essay film, part road picture, part musical anthology — is built around an astonishing historical coincidence. On June 21, 1964, two lost giants of the Delta blues, Skip James and Son House, were found by separate crews of obsessed music fans after weeks of amateur sleuthing along the back roads of Mississippi. James and House had each made a handful of recordings in the ’30s and ’40s, and then faded into obscurity until the folk revival of the early ’60s piqued the interest of students and coffeehouse guitar pickers in the college towns of the North.One car, captained by the guitarist John Fahey, set out from Berkeley, Calif., in search of Skip James. Another left Cambridge, Mass., following a wisp of a clue about where Son House might be. At the same time, other, larger groups of students were preparing to travel to Mississippi for reasons having little to do with music. They were part of Freedom Summer, a campaign organized mainly by the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, to register black voters in the state. On June 21, three of those activists — James Chaney, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman — disappeared near Philadelphia, Miss. They were killed by the Ku Klux Klan.With deep historical knowledge and nimble storytelling techniques, Mr. Pollard explores how idealism, horrific brutality and artistic genius converged in a single historical moment. Interviews with survivors, eyewitnesses, scholars and musicians are complemented with archival material, animation (which is fast becoming a staple of modern documentary filmmaking) and the retrospective thoughts of critics, journalists and musicians. Some of these are a little distracting. It’s nice to hear Lucinda Williams, Gary Clark Jr. and others testify to (and demonstrate) the enduring influence of James and House, but it’s infinitely more valuable to hear the men themselves.
5365	 1987	a	Esquire, the monthly that has been one of the magazine industry's greatest turnaround stories in recent years, was bought yesterday by the Hearst Corporation as part of the sale and breakup of Esquire's parent company, the Esquire Magazine Group Inc.As part of the overall transaction, the American Express Publishing Corporation bought the Esquire group's six-month-old publication, New York Woman. Whittle Communications of Knoxville, Tenn., acquired its Esquire Health and Fitness Clinic, which publishes a magazine-on-the-wall for health clubs. And the shareholders of the Esquire Magazine Group will continue to own the company's Esquire Press, its book publishing division, and Esquire Video.Phillip Moffitt, editor in chief and president of the Esquire group, said financial terms of the deals would not be made public. He said he would become an editorial consultant to both Hearst and American Express Publishing for an interim period.Rumors that Hearst would buy Esquire magazine had been circulating for several weeks. But it had not been apparent that Mr. Moffitt would almost completely relinquish his involvement in the communications empire that he and his erstwhile partner, Christopher Whittle, had carved out in the last 10 years.

3909	 1997	a	MR. CLINTON pledged that the United States would cut emissions to 1990 levels in the next 10 to 15 years. The turnabout in emissions will be encouraged at first with tax incentives and research subsidies for conservation and clean energy production.In later years, a cap will be placed on greenhouse emissions, coupled with a system to give credits for emissions reductions that companies can save and sell. It is a system in which the Government will set a mandatory goal but leave the mechanism to the market instead of turning to a Government fiat.If the Administration's approach delivers the promised reductions, emissions between 2008 and 2012 will be about a third lower than current trends would predict.But nobody knows how much that will cost. ''There is no credible, widely accepted economic analysis that currently exists in the United States, or in most other countries, that can answer very basic cost and benefit questions,'' said Eileen B. Claussen, a former senior aide to Mr. Wirth who had played an instrumental role in the talks but left the Administration a few months ago.It wasn't for lack of trying. The Administration struggled for two years to come up with a credible analysis of the economic effects of moving away from fossil fuels, but the uncertainties -- over things like what the United States economy will look like a decade from now, what technological advances in emissions controls will be made and how willing consumers and manufacturers will be to respond to economic incentives -- proved overwhelming. Ms. Yellen essentially declared the effort to come up with reliable numbers a failure last summer.That opened the door to something of a policy-making free-for-all that lasted well into the fall and has left many members of Congress wary, Ms. Claussen said.There was never any serious debate inside the Administration about the science of the issue; the White House has decided that the climate problem is real and serious. After all, the leading environmentalist of them all is Mr. Gore, and he long ago won over President Clinton on the need to do something about the threat of climate change.

1543	 2010	a	Neil WolkodoffEver wonder if you play better golf riding in a cart or walking? Ever wonder how many calories you burn in a typical round? Or if you would play better if you were in better shape? Ever wonder if golf is truly a sport?Neil Wolkodoff wondered all those things, too. And as the director of the Center for Health and Sport Science at the Rose Medical Center in Denver, he knew how to find the answers. Two years ago, he bought $27,000 worth of equipment to conduct a painstaking set of tests on amateur golfers. When he was done, he had some findings that could settle a lot of barroom arguments.For example, in Wolkodoff’s study, golfers scored lower while walking with a caddie or with their clubs on a push cart than they did when using a motorized cart. And golfers carrying a golf bag posted the highest average score.As one might expect, the most energy was expended while walking with a bag (721 calories burned for nine holes). But walking with a push cart was not far behind (718). Walking with a caddie burned 621 calories for nine holes, and riding in a cart still burned 411 calories on average.“One of the surprise realizations was that just swinging a golf club about 100 times uses up a significant amount of energy,” Wolkodoff said.Each of the golfers went through rigorous testing before the study to establish their aerobic endurance and anaerobic threshold levels — the point when lactic acid buildup generally begins to impair coordination and concentration. This became important because Wolkodoff could watch readouts from six pounds of sensors strapped to the golfers and identify when they had gone beyond their fitness level.Neil WolkodoffWhat Wolkodoff discovered was that exceeding one’s anaerobic threshold usually went hand in hand with ineffective golf. Think, for example, of someone walking up a steep hill and then having to execute a delicate chip without the two-minute recovery period needed to restore heart and respiratory rates to normal.So being fit cuts strokes.“If you’re out of shape, exceeding your threshold could happen a few times every round, even while riding in a cart, because tee boxes and green complexes are often elevated,” Wolkodoff said. “Your golf game will suffer. Somebody with the yips might just be a little winded after walking up to the green. At the same time, being in better physical condition would make you better mechanically and mentally.”Finally, is golf a sport rather than a game?“There are a lot of ways to define a sport,” Wolkodoff said. “But we know that the golf swing uses almost every muscle group in the body. We know it uses a pretty significant amount of energy — not as much as running a 10K but more than people think. And one significant measure of a sport is whether physical training improves your ability to perform, and I think that’s been proven in golf.“So in my estimation, it’s absolutely a sport.”Neil WolkodoffWolkodoff’s study, which may be the first of its kind, had its limits. Because the equipment was cumbersome, expensive and took about two hours to put on and take off, his test group was just eight golfers. They were men ranging in age from 26 to 62 and had handicaps from 2 to 17. Each played the front nine at a championship-quality Denver-area course four times on different days — walking with a push cart, walking with a caddie, walking and carrying their golf bag, and riding in a golf cart.Weather conditions were similar each day. The golfers were required, as much as was possible, to approach the nine holes the same way each time. In other words, if they had hit driver off the first tee in their first round, they had to hit driver again on the first hole of their final three rounds. The sequencing of how they played the rounds was varied; not everyone played with a golf cart first, then with a caddie and so on.The golfers’ results during the four rounds tracked similarly with consistent statistical trends. For example, seven of the eight golfers reported the same scoring pattern: lowest while playing with a pushcart (group average was a five-over-par 40 for nine holes), followed by playing with a caddie (42), playing in a motor cart (43) and playing while carrying their bag (45). Wolkodoff received no commercial sponsorship or financing for the study other than from the Rose Medical Center. He donated his time, which amounted to about 500 hours.“It’s not a perfect study, but I think we discovered some things,” Wolkodoff said. “You throw the findings out there and let people take their potshots at them, which is fine. I would like to see someone do a follow-up study. But if it hasn’t been done before, it’s because of all the time, equipment and data involved.”In fact, representatives at the P.G.A. of America, the United States Golf Association and the National Golf Foundation said they were not aware of studies exactly like Wolkodoff’s. A recent University of Pittsburgh study measured one golfer’s caloric expenditure as he walked with a bag, walked with a caddie and rode in a cart. That study put the number of calories burned at higher rates than Wolkodoff’s study — about 1,000 calories for nine holes of walking and carrying, 750 for walking with a caddie and 650 for riding in a cart. A Swedish study two years ago concluded that golfers there lived five years longer than nongolfers. But nearly all golfers in Sweden walk while playing.“The health benefits of walking was the best news of our study,” said Wolkodoff, adding that the complete results could be found on his center’s Web site, rosechss.com. “Playing 18 holes of golf while pushing a cart twice a week shouldn’t replace an overall fitness regimen, but it could be a very worthy supplement.”But on many golf courses, it isn’t possible to walk because golf courses promote the use of carts to raise their revenue.“There are positives to golf being helpful to people’s health and wellness,” Greg Nathan, the senior vice president for membership at the National Golf Foundation, said when discussing Wolkodoff’s study. “But there can be an opposite effect. The renting of golf carts is important to the health and welfare of the golf industry.”Add to that the perception that cart use speeds play, a myth that has been debunked by several studies but a myth that persists nonetheless. Some golf courses are also designed with long distances between some tees. And, of course, some people cannot walk the golf course for various physical reasons. Still, spreading the word that walking while playing will yield significant health benefits could help the game grow.“I don’t just play golf to lose money to my sandbagging friends,” you could tell your spouse. “I do it for both of us because I want to stay in shape.”It would be true, and it would apparently help your score and perhaps your wallet.In the end, I think Wolkodoff and his many microchips have just scratched the surface. I’ve got plenty of other 19th-hole arguments he could settle: Do golfers usually play better alone or in a group? Do they usually play better in the morning or the evening? Better on the front nine or the back nine?It’s not my research money, but I think we’re just getting started.VideoCorrection: August 5, 2010An article on Monday about scientific research in golf misstated the surname of the senior vice president for membership at the National Golf Foundation.

2556	 2004	a	BY pointing readers to the Web's newest and best bits, Web logs offer a way to cut through online clutter. But now that there are millions of blogs, what was once a solution to the information glut has started to become part of the problem. So perhaps inevitably, sites and services have popped up that add another level to the information food chain by digesting the Web digests.The latest such site, Kinja, is scheduled to open to the public today at www.kinja.com. The site automatically compiles digests of blogs covering subject areas like politics and baseball. Short excerpts from the blogs are included, with links to the complete entries on the individual blog sites. After signing up for a free account with Kinja, users can enter the addresses of their favorite blogs and generate a digest -- a customized blog of blogs.The site is designed for people who may have heard about Web logs but are not sure how to start reading them, said Nick Denton, Kinja's president, whose small blog-publishing empire includes the New York gossip site Gawker (gawker.com).''Everyone has this illusion that Web logs have taken the world by storm,'' Mr. Denton said, ''but Web logs have probably only reached 10 percent of the Internet population. Our goal is to reach the remainder.''

1299	 2011	a	Daniel Acker/Bloomberg NewsYahoo is in talks to shed its 35 percent stake in its Yahoo Japan joint venture, possibly handing over control to its partner, Softbank, people briefed on the matter told DealBook on Tuesday.Any deal between Yahoo and Softbank is unlikely to be a straightforward sale of the stake and could instead take the form of a spinoff of some kind, said these people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.No deal is imminent, these people said, adding that talks are continuing and may still fall apart.Representatives for Yahoo and Softbank were not immediately available for comment.The talks are taking place as Yahoo struggles to determine its future. The Internet pioneer has increasingly found itself outpaced by newer, faster-growing rivals like Google and Facebook, and has lagged in efforts to expand in hot new areas like social networking and group buying.Yahoo’s discussions raise some questions about what the company may do with its roughly 40 percent stake in Alibaba. But these people cautioned that Yahoo isn’t contemplating any sale of its holdings in Alibaba, one of China’s most prominent Internet companies.Softbank owns a stake in Alibaba as well.Softbank’s chief executive, Masayoshi Son, previously hinted to DealBook that he would be interested in eventually striking a deal with Yahoo over the stake.“Our interests and her interests do not necessarily contradict each other,” he said, referring to Yahoo’s chief executive, Carol A. Bartz. “Sooner or later we will have a win-win situation.”News of the talks was first reported by Reuters.

360	 2017	a	Norman Dorsen, a passionate human rights advocate who led the American Civil Liberties Union for 15 years and was involved in some of the biggest civil liberties cases of the second half of the 20th century, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 86.The cause was complications of a stroke, his daughter Annie said.Mr. Dorsen’s career-long focus on civil liberties was informed by his involvement in the Army-McCarthy Hearings in 1954. He went on to argue Supreme Court cases that established juveniles’ rights to due process and that acknowledged the rights of children born out of wedlock. He was also one of the first lawyers to argue before the court in favor of abortion rights and gay rights.Mr. Dorsen was a key figure at New York University School of Law, where he joined the faculty and became the director of the civil liberties program in 1961. Partly through Mr. Dorsen’s influence, the school gained a reputation for attracting students and faculty with an interest in public interest law.“Perhaps no one else in the history of N.Y.U. Law shaped this place as profoundly, or affected it as deeply, as Norman,” said Trevor W. Morrison, the school’s dean.

3499	 1999	a	HOLLYWOOD CARTOONSAmerican Animation in Its Golden Age.By Michael Barrier.Oxford, $39.95.The best animated cartoons of the 1940's and 50's -- Walt Disney's ''Dumbo,'' Chuck Jones's ''Duck Amuck'' and ''One Froggy Evening,'' Tex Avery's ''King-Size Canary,'' John Hubley's ''Rooty Toot Toot'' -- are miniature masterpieces that can stand direct comparison with the silent films of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd. Such, at any rate, is the thesis of ''Hollywood Cartoons,'' and Michael Barrier, formerly the publisher and editor of Funnyworld magazine, makes a strong case for it, in part because he is so rigorous a critic. Outside of a few evocative memoirs, much of what has been written about Hollywood animation smacks of cheerleading; this book, by contrast, is a genuinely thoughtful attempt to explain what makes golden-age cartoons work, and why some work better than others. Nostalgia merchants may bristle at some of Barrier's more sharply drawn distinctions, particularly his shrewd analysis of the decline in quality of Jones's later cartoons (Jones's version of Bugs Bunny ''was simply too pleased with himself . . . he minces and flounces and verges on effeminacy''). But those who take the art of animation seriously will find this tough-minded book challenging and revelatory. Terry Teachout

7524	 1964	a	HOUSTON, Nov. 30 — The New York Yankees finally upstaged the New York Mets today by drafting Dulce Carmel, the hard‐hitting first baseman and outfielder of the Mets’ No. 1 farm club, Buffalo.Carmel was the Yankees’ only choice among four “senior” minor leaguers claimed by bigleague teams for $25,000 fees at the formal opening of organized baseball's winter meeting.The 20 big‐league teams then drafted a record number of 59 first‐year players at $8,000 each from one another's farm clubs, with the Yankees and Mets taking one each. The Yankees chose Eliseo Rodriguez, an 18-year‐old catcher from the Bronx. The Mets with room for only one new player on their bulging roster.” drafted Bob Nash, a 20-year‐old outfielder from Wellsville in the New York‐Pennsylvania League.The Kansas City Athletics were the first to draft a player for $25,000. They picked Jim Dickson, a 26-year‐old righthander who compiled a 9-3 won‐lost record last season with the San Diego Padres and had been up briefly with the Houston Colts in 1963.
2515	 2004	a	Burns became a prosperous grocer and banker in a section of Hartford known as Frog Hollow, which is where the Irish Catholic immigrants then lived. The culture followed his family when it moved to prosperous West Hartford.Initially, young John was ashamed of being an Irish-American. He found the Irish in this country a parochial lot. But as he matured and tried to define himself, he found he was drawn to Frog Hollow, which, he said, gave him a strong sense of who he was.But, typically, he put a humorous edge on that, saying that his family went ''from steerage to the suburbs in three generations.''As a boy, Mr. Dunne stuttered, and so he found it reassuring to write whatever it was he had to say in order to give a better account of himself. The more he wrote, the better he got at capturing the speech patterns of others on paper. His mother wanted him to be a gentleman -- a businessman -- and in preparation for that, his family sent him to the Portsmouth Priory school, a Rhode Island institution run by the Benedictines.He did well enough there to gain admission to Princeton, from which he earned his bachelor's degree in 1954. Soon after graduation, he volunteered for the Army before he was drafted, and underwent basic training at Fort Chaffee, Ark., where he did not distinguish himself. He lost his rifle, a mistake he called ''the military equivalent of a mortal sin,'' and he failed to qualify on the firing range with whatever weapon they gave him to replace the one he had lost.After his discharge, he dismayed his mother by choosing not to attend a business school and instead went to New York City. He worked at first for an advertising agency and eventually for Time magazine, then a highly stylized and unabashedly conservative Republican organ. Mr. Dunne remained at Time for five years and liked journalism, but decided he did not want to do it the way most journalists did.

963	 2013	a	PhotoLast Updated, Tuesday, 10:52 a.m. Just two weeks after a Greek soccer player who celebrated a goal with a fascist salute was barred from representing his country for life, an Italian coach who made the same gesture repeatedly during his playing days has been hired by a club in England’s top division.The appointment of Paolo Di Canio to manage Sunderland, a club struggling to avoid relegation from the English Premier League, was immediately condemned by at least one board member, the former British foreign minister David Miliband, who resigned in protest over “the new manager’s past political statements.”The most famous of those statements came in 2005, when Di Canio told an Italian news agency, “I’m a fascist, not a racist,” when he was barred for one game for making what he called “the Roman salute” to Irriducibili, right-wing fans of the club he supported as a boy, Lazio. “I made the Roman salute because it’s a salute from a comrade to his comrades and was meant for my people,” he added. “With this stiff arm I do no want to incite violence or racial hatred.”Di Canio, who has the Latin word for “leader” tattooed on his arm in tribute to Mussolini, made the fascist salute at least three times in 2005 before being barred. On one occasion he even raised his arm, in full view of television cameras, at a match in Livorno, where the home team’s fans were known for their left-wing sympathies and the club’s star player, Cristiano Lucarelli, celebrated goals by revealing a Che Guevara T-shirt worn under his jersey.PhotoSeveral years earlier, Di Canio acknowledged in his autobiography that he was “fascinated by Mussolini.” In a passage that mixed praise and condemnation for Il Duce, Di Canio told Gabriele Marcotti, the journalist who was co-author of his memoir:I think he was a deeply misunderstood individual. He deceived people. His actions were often vile. But all this was motivated by a higher purpose. He was basically a very principled individual. Yet he turned against his sense of right and wrong. He compromised his ethics.Despite these apparently frank admissions of his political sympathies in the past, Di Canio’s new employers reacted with indignation when the issue was raised on Monday. “It is disappointing that some people are trying to turn the appointment of a head coach into a political circus,” Sunderland’s chief executive, Margaret Byrne, said in a statement. She went on to blame the news media for misrepresenting the coach’s views. “To accuse him now, as some have done, of being a racist or having fascist sympathies,” Ms. Byrne said, “is insulting not only to him but to the integrity of this football club.”For his part, Di Canio said in a video interview for the club’s Web site that it was “stupid and ridiculous” to accuse him of racism, naming three black players he was friends with during his career. One of those players, however, the Trinidadian-British goalkeeper Shaka Hislop, told the BBC in 2005 that he no longer considered himself friends with Di Canio after the salutes, “because of what those gestures mean and the wider effect of it.” He added, “Paolo was certainly someone I considered a friend who I liked a lot, so I am very disappointed.”Asked point-blank at a news conference on Tuesday, “Are you a fascist?” Di Canio refused an invitation to clarify his views and insisted that he would not answer any questions on politics. “In 45 years, I never had a problem with anyone,” he said, “so that has to be enough, forever: that Paolo Di Canio is a normal person who respects the rules like many others.”As Britain’s Channel 4 News reported, following the appointment, a local miners’ group called it, “a disgrace and a betrayal of all who fought and died in the fight against fascism,” and asked the club to return a union banner displayed at Sunderland’s stadium which was built on the site of a former coal mine. Dave Hopper, the general secretary of the Durham Miners’ Association, wrote: “Our banner represents the Durham miners’ long struggle for the rights of the working class, rights which were annihilated by fascism in Germany, Italy, Spain and Chile. We have a sacred obligation to the millions who were wiped out by Hitler, Mussolini and Franco to oppose fascism wherever and in whatever context this evil creed raises its head.”Writing on Twitter on Monday, Di Canio’s co-author argued that even though he does not share the new Sunderland coach’s politics — he called the salute “wrong and insensitive” — it was incorrect to call him a Nazi or a racist.@Marcotti I’m at a loss to respond to this. This says it all . No ambiguity here Gabby. Pro-nazi #fact //t.co/dZaGNzvR1P — Stevie (@stevebhoy) 1 Apr 13@stevebhoy no, not fact. That’s a roman fascist salute to Lazio fans who made same back. It’s their salute. Not making nazi statement — Gabriele Marcotti (@Marcotti) 1 Apr 13@DannyColclough I’m not defending the salute. It was wrong and insensitive and loaded. But it doesn’t make him a Nazi. — Gabriele Marcotti (@Marcotti) 1 Apr 13Mr. Marcotti also thanked another journalist for drawing attention to another passage from the memoir, in which Di Canio expressed some sympathy for the difficulties encountered by immigrants to Italy.Thanks to @aasmahmir for this. //t.co/Uxr4h89AFC As she says, primary source, make up your own mind. — Gabriele Marcotti (@Marcotti) 1 Apr 13In the interview with Sunderland’s Web site on Monday, Di Canio also claimed that the news media were unfairly representing his views by quoting just one portion of the long interview that was used for his biography. “I expressed an opinion in an interview many years ago,” he said. “Some pieces were taken for media convenience. They took my expression in a very, very negative way – but it was a long conversation and a long interview. It was not fair.”He added: “What offends me more than everything is not because they touch me; they touch what my parents taught to me; the values they gave to me. This is not acceptable. So, what I can say? If someone is hurt, I’m sorry, but that didn’t come from me, it came from a big story that people put out in a different way to what it was.”
5121	 1989	a	Mike Krukow, a Giants starter, underwent arthroscopic surgery yesterday that disclosed a torn rotator cuff in his pitching shoulder. The 37-year-old right-hander, is expected to miss at least the rest of this season.''It doesn't look good,'' Manager Roger Craig said. ''It's a lot worse than we thought.''Krukow, who was originally thought to be suffering from bursitis, has spent parts of each of the last three seasons on the disabled list with shoulder injuries. Last year he pitched 124Z innings, the lowest total in his 11-year career.This season Krukow had pitched only 43 innings in eight appearances, compiling a 4-3 record.(AP)
2674	 2004	a	"Chris was the core of this house -- everybody looked up to him," said Firefighter Mark Klinger, who had worked with Firefighter Engeldrum for the last five years."An excellent firefighter, a good father, a good friend," Firefighter Klinger added. "That's all I can say."Firefighter Engeldrum had completed his service with the National Guard, but re-enlisted. He did so, his colleagues said, in outrage at the Sept. 11 attack. "It had an effect on him," said Lt. Brian Horton of Ladder Company 61. "His country was attacked, he was a soldier, and he wanted to defend it."Firefighter Engeldrum is survived by his wife, Sharon, and his two sons: Sean, 18, and Royce, 16. Royce's birthday, fire officials said, was the day his father died.The firefighter last spoke with his family the night before Thanksgiving."He was glad to hear my voice," Mrs. Engeldrum recalled. "He was tired. He couldn't talk. He was going out on a mission. He just called to see if everything was O.K. here."At City Hall, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg praised Firefighter Engeldrum for having served not only in the Fire Department, but also in the Police Department. "Christian Engeldrum spent his life protecting the people of this city and protecting democracy," the mayor said. "As a firefighter, a police officer and a decorated member of our military, there was no risk he wasn't willing to take for his fellow New Yorkers and his fellow Americans."Thirty city firefighters are on active duty overseas. Since Sept. 11, 2001, 103 have been called to active duty.

4879	 1991	a	'Why is the family so universally revered?" Henig asks. "Why do we admire people who choose spending time with their children over spending time at work?" Just who is this "we" she writes about? The majority of Americans no longer inhabit families out of "Father Knows Best," where Mom and Dad "choose" to spend time with their 2.6 children. And Bud and his sisters don't customarily lead lives chock-full of "orthodontist appointments, piano lessons and fencing classes." Instead, Mom is often divorced from Dad and getting little or no child support. She doesn't have the luxury of "choosing" to spend more time with the children because she's working a second job at minimum wage. ROBERT HERRIG Norwalk, Conn.

119	 2019	a	KABUL, Afghanistan — Samsor Dawlatzai, a part-time laborer, settled in after dinner Monday night to watch a television interview with the American peace envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad.The envoy had just mentioned reaching a peace agreement “in principle” with the Taliban when Mr. Dawlatzai’s house collapsed on top of him, his family and his guests. A suicide truck bombing nearby left eight people in the house bloodied and battered, among them a 1-year-old boy, five women and a guest lacerated by flying glass as he prayed.“What peace are you talking about?” Mr. Dawlatzai asked Tuesday, referring to Mr. Khalilzad.Mr. Dawlatzai, 23, had the misfortune of living near Green Village, a fortified compound of foreign nationals that had been rocked by bombings in the past. The latest attack, on Monday night, destroyed or badly damaged dozens of nearby shops and homes, killing up to 30 people and wounding at least 100, security officials said.The police in Kabul said Wednesday that six foreign nationals were killed in Monday’s attack – five Nepalese and one Romanian.
4915	 1990	a	Stocks rose for the third session in a row yesterday on moderately higher volume, and the Dow Jones Industrial average, which was up more than 28 points in the early afternoon, finished 10.13 points higher at 2,627.25.So far this week, the Dow has risen more than 63 points.Advances on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered declines, 917 to 565, as volume rose to 164.4 million shares, from 152.6 million on Tuesday.It appeared that once again the movement of the stock market in Tokyo had little impact on the course of equities in the United States. The 225-stock Nikkei index climbed 694.04 points, or 2.05 percent, relatively a much larger increase than the Dow, which gained only four-tenths of 1 percent. Indeed, some analysts characterized this week's upward move by equities as primarily technical in nature.''The stock market is exhibiting a markedly more durable tone in the midst of what appears to be a massive shift in both trading psychology and industry leadership,'' said Eugene E. Peroni Jr., chief technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.

4330	 1994	a	There can be no amnesty for war criminals," Lord Owen, international mediator in the Yugoslav conflict, said last year. "I believe the moral order of this world is marred if those who are guilty of war crimes are not brought to justice."The U.N. Security Council voted 16 months ago to create a War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. But to date no prosecution has been brought, and many wonder whether any of the murderers and torturers who have ravaged Bosnia will ever be brought to book.In fact, a good deal of progress has been made in establishing the court and gathering potential evidence. The first indictments are expected by September or October.The War Crimes Tribunal has 11 judges from around the world, chosen by the General Assembly. The court has adopted rules of evidence and is ready to receive proposed indictments at its seat in The Hague.

4766	 1991	a	To the Editor:After sweating out my tax return for the 50-something year, I was startled to read a complaint by Neil Howe and William Strauss ("America's 13th Generation," Op-Ed, March 16) that added insult to injury. They said young workers see "increases in taxes they pay while tax rates on elders are falling."It is true that taxes have gone up unfairly for young workers. Also for middle-aged workers, and for elderly workers. Indeed, a good case can be made that elders who continue to work are the most heavily taxed Americans today. That is because from retirement age to 70, Social Security pensions are reduced by a portion of earnings, and after 70 1/2 workers are now denied the privilege of sheltering earnings in individual retirement accounts. All the while, these elders must continue to pay full Social Security taxes on earnings, usually with no increase in benefits.The extra personal exemption for over-65's has been repealed. No complaint here, but the costs of health care are no longer deductible until they exceed 7.5 percent of gross income. Since the elderly require more care, their out-of-pocket costs have risen more than the average despite what Mr. Howe and Mr. Strauss call "a national health-care system that insures the affluent old while leaving the young with no coverage."Now, depending on how one defines affluence, the affluent comprise no more than 2 percent or 3 percent of Medicare patients, who also include disabled workers. But the elderly also as a group provide the most enthusiastic support for a civilized cradle-to-grave health-care system.
2879	 2002	a	New Jersey Transit plans to hire 30 more police officers in the next year for a total of 141 officers. Jeffrey A. Warsh, executive director of the agency, said higher salaries would make it easier to hire officers. A recent contract raised salaries to a range of $39,000 to $60,000 annually from a range of $29,000 to $47,000. New Jersey Transit is also adding three teams of bomb-sniffing dogs, and will have police officers meet trains as commuters stream onto platforms. Daily ridership to New York's Pennsylvania Station totaled nearly 34,000 before Sept. 11, peaked at 48,500 in mid-October, then leveled off at about 44,000 recently.

2558	 2004	a	India's economy soared 10.4 percent in the final quarter of 2003, making it one of the fastest growing in the world, even ahead of China.The last quarter's rise, up from an 8.4 percent pace in the previous quarter, was driven mainly by an expansion of nearly 17 percent in farm output. Last season, the country benefited from the heaviest monsoon rains in over a decade. Farming accounts for a quarter of India's economy.The Center for Monitoring of the Indian Economy, based in Mumbai, said in its monthly review released Wednesday that overall gross domestic product, earlier forecast at around 8 percent, would probably be above 9 percent in the government's fiscal year ending this month.But the jump, which makes India the fastest-growing Asian economy, is unlikely to continue.''I would not get too excited about the double digits because there is a big skew in farm output this year which is unlikely to repeat,'' said Jyotivardhan Jaipuria, head of research at DSP Merrill Lynch.

6292	 1972	a	Advocates of school decentralization here reacted with dismay and sadness to Dr. Kenneth B. Clark's announcement before the Temporary State Charter Revision Commission for New York City that he had become a “vehement foe” of decentralization.“I think Ken is expressing as usual his deep frustration about the progress of education,” said David Seeley, director of the Public Education Association. “But even more disastrous would be to try to return to a centralized body which for a period of 20 years showed itself increasingly unable to cope with the problems.”Dr. Clark, one of the early advocates of school decentralization, told the commission in private testimony that decentralization had become a “disastrous” experiment in which the basic issue—teaching children—had beed subordinated to “racial politics.”While not advocating a return to the old centralized school system, Dr. Clark, a professor of psychology at City College and a member of the State Board of Regents, warned Against a “simplistic manipulation of the bureaucratic structure.”

1567	 2010	a	Eric MartinForget waxed mustaches, plaid thermoses and suspenders. The new men’s-wear label Jon Ashe is bringing back a sleeker and more understated version of heritage chic. “You have to strike a balance between being innovative and tribal,” says Jonas Hegewisch, who designs the fledgling collection. His idea of “tribal” doesn’t include far-flung ethnic influences. He’s talking about belonging to a social “tribe,” as in Williamsburg hipsters or corporate America. “The aesthetic that appeals to me has a certain rustic quality,” explains Hegewisch, who is originally from Germany. (Before starting Jon Ashe, he collaborated with his wife Ursula on Wearkstatt, a fashion-forward bridal business; he also owned Trailer Park, one of Berlin’s coolest biergartens.) “But I try to bring different elements together.”Those elements include formal suiting and vintage worker‘s uniforms. Meticulously tailored but stripped of all padding, the Jon Ashe look is perhaps best described as falling somewhere between dandy and 1930s construction worker. All of the garments are produced in New York City; the high-end fabrics are sourced from small mills in Britain (tweed), Italy (cashmere) and Japan (cotton). Horn buttons come from Austria and custom-made leather belts are from Ohio.But the real strength of the collection lies in the precise but easy-to-wear silhouettes. “Being comfortabIe puts you in a better mood,” Hegewisch says. “I spend a lot of time looking at people to see what makes them look happy. Happy people are more attractive.” It only makes sense then that Jon Ashe, a bohemian who doubles as the designer’s alter ego (the name is derived from the first letters of Hegewisch’s own), is the happiest man of all. The imaginary muse is a Vespa-riding Brooklyner whose enviable life consists of cruising around the New York harbor in his small yacht, sipping artisanal cocktails and playing drums in a “frock band” (a style yet to be defined). “It’s the life I hope to have one day if my collection takes off,” Hegewisch says. “So he’s a motivation as well as an inspiration.”At the end of September Mr. Ashe will get his very own headquarters. Hegewisch is currently putting the finishing touches on a flagship store on the corner of Grand and Crosby Streets. The store — a chic man-cave with felt-upholstered walls and broken-in furniture — will feature the full Jon Ashe line as well as luggage, shoes, vintage hiking canes and meticulously stirred cocktails. “It will be like my living room,” Hegewisch promises, “only better.”

6020	 1978	a	A small group of businessmen and bankers were discussing economic development in New York City over lunch recently, arguing about whether they would put any more productive facilities into the decaying city. The talk turned quickly toward crime, and to the problem of stealing in plants.“You'd have to make something they couldn't carry out,” one man joked. Another, the head of a division of a major New York‐based corporation, said he certainly would not expand his plant in Brooklyn after he had seen the ease of doing business in Mississippi.The conversation illustrates a severe problem facing the nation's central cities ‐ the loss of confidence in the urban environment by business. And in large part the Carter Administration urban policy announced last week is designed to change that deep‐seated attitude ‐ to persuade private enterprise to stay in the cities and to provide more jobs there.“The principal thrust of this program is a reliance on the private sector,” says Roger Altman, an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, a former New York investment banker and one of the architects of the urban program. After sweeping Federal programs in the 1960's and neglect of the cities in the 1970's, the Administration “feels strongly,” he said, “that the key to long‐term economic growth and employment in the cities is the private sector.”

969	 2013	a	Corrected the price of the Coolpix A.Marketers like to promote cameras based on the number of megapixels, but a much better measure of image quality is the size of a camera’s sensor.By that measure, the new Nikon Coolpix A ought to be pretty good. It crams the same size sensor you’d find many Nikon Digital single lens reflex cameras (called an APS-C sensor) into a compact camera body 4.4- by 2.6- by 1.6-inches.Larger sensors generally work better in low light, capture more detail and have less visual noise than smaller ones. And sure enough, the test shots that I took were terrifically detailed, each hair discernible and because I was able to shoot at a low ISO, there was virtually no visual noise.PhotoBut there are already compact cameras with big sensors, like the $650 Sony RX-100 and the $1,300 Fuji X100S. The Coolpix A, which sells for about $1,100, is notable for what it does not have: a zoom lens. The camera comes with the equivalent of a 28mm wide angle, and that’s it. Also, the lens’s largest aperture is F2.8, which is not impressive for a camera at this price.There is nothing wrong with a good wide angle lens. They are known among photojournalists as “the story telling lens” for their ability to capture a broad vista while keeping both foreground and background objects in focus. The lens on the Coolpix A would make it handy for travel, because it is well suited to landscapes, architecture and settings like markets and plazas. But it is not the best lens for portraiture, and certainly not ideal for sports and action shots.The Coolpix A does give the photographer more control than the average point and shoot, including many flash settings, so you can add a subtle hint of fill flash once you learn the controls.But I can’t quite get past the math. For the same money, you could easily buy a Nikon DSLR and not one, but two fixed lenses. Granted, that rig won’t fit in a pocket, but it would be so much more flexible.An earlier version of this post misstated the price of the Coolpix A camera. It is $1,100, not $1,200.

3304	 2000	a	''A brilliant thesis drawn from insight into the future,'' said the party's official paper, People's Daily, on May 22 in a typical description. ''A concentrated embodiment of the fundamental nature of the party and the essence of socialism.''In other newspapers, officials have called Mr. Jiang's prosaic statement ''pregnant with connotations and meanings,'' ''a scientific summation of our party's nearly 80 years of historical importance'' and ''a great program for party-building in the new century.''The Liberation Army Daily hailed it as ''an essential compass for military, ideological and political construction in the new era,'' while the Federation of Trade Unions, not to be outdone, said Mr. Jiang ''answers the question of why and how the working class is relied on the during the process of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.'' The China Women's News proclaimed, ''The 'Three Represents' are the criteria for women's work.''The campaign is, of course, low-key compared with the vicious political winds of the Mao era, and much of the population today can simply tune it out. At the popular Xinhua Bookstore in central Beijing today, most customers walked right past the rack up front that featured the booklet on Mr. Jiang's speeches.But the booklet is a best seller at the Party Documents Bookstore, where officials are buying it in bulk for their colleagues, and ambitious party and government leaders can hardly afford to ignore the new catch phrases.''Quite apart from substance, the campaign is a test of whether subordinates and local leaders in the provinces are staying in step,'' the editor said. ''That's why in recent days we've seen one local leader after another coming forward -- it's a way to affirm their allegiance and keep their jobs.''This new campaign went into overdrive even before last year's ''Three Stresses'' campaign (theoretical study, political awareness and good conduct) had fully run its course, causing complaints about the sheer waste of time and energy.

2325	 2006	a	“We worship an awesome God in the blue states,” Senator Barack Obama said in his star-making speech at the 2004 Democratic convention. Democrats would go on to do some major soul searching about why people who called themselves “values voters” were voting for Republicans. The party has looked for ways to close the “God Gap” and some view Mr. Obama as a Democrat who just might have the whole “God talk” thing down.That didn’t stop some major conservative Christian leaders from objecting to Mr. Obama’s scheduled appearance at an AIDS summit at Saddleback Church, a California megachurch run by Pastor Rick Warren, author of “The Purpose-Driven Life.” Phyllis Schlafly, the head of the Eagle Forum, led 17 other conservative leaders in a letter urging Mr. Warren to rescind the invitation due to Mr. Obama’s support of legalized abortion:You cannot fight one evil while justifying another. The evangelical church can provide no genuine help for those who suffer from AIDS if those involved do not first have their ethic of life firmly rooted in the Word of God.Mr. Warren defended his decision and stuck to it:This summit will put people together who normally won’t even speak to each other. But if you can only work with folks you completely agree with, you’ve ruled out most of the world.So Mr. Obama appeared earlier today, and despite the furor building up to his appearance, he didn’t hesitate to make comments that might alienate his hosts:Like no other illness, AIDS tests our ability to put ourselves in somebody else’s shoes, to empathize with the plight of our fellow man, to live up to the Golden Rule. While most would agree that the AIDS orphan or the transfusion victim or the wronged wife contracting the disease through no fault of their own needs help, sometimes it’s been easy for us to distance ourselves from those who we think are somehow at fault — the promiscuous youth or the unfaithful husband or the gay man — and say, ‘This is your fault, you’ve sinned. We have nothing to do with you.’ And I don’t think that’s a satisfactory response. My faith reminds me that we are all sinners. My faith reminds me that there are times where I have fallen and made mistakes. My faith tells me, as Pastor Rick has said, that it’s not a sin to be sick. My Bible tells me that when God sent His only son to Earth it was to heal the sick and comfort the weary and feed the hungry and clothe the naked, to befriend the outcast and redeem those who had strayed from righteousness.And, in the something-for-everyone style the junior senator from Illinois is becoming famous for, he even had a little bit of political grist for Republicans in the audience:Now, let me say this: I want to publicly applaud the Bush administration — I don’t do that that often. And sometimes unfairly so. Because this is an area where I think the Bush administration has not gotten enough credit. The administration and this Congress have been serious about putting resources in contributing to the fight against HIV and AIDS.Tonight, Mr. Obama moves on to a more secular stage, when he’ll appear on the Jay Leno show. Let’s hope he has the audacity to best one of Mr. Leno’s jokes.
304	 2017	a	The American Diabetes Association, by contrast, reported receiving more than $28 million in industry funding in 2014, or about 15 percent of its budget, but provided detailed disclosures of which companies donated, and how much, the study authors said.In a statement, the hemophilia foundation said it never allows its corporate sponsors to influence its decision-making, and that it also does not endorse specific products or favor certain companies. It declined to provide precise dollar amounts of contributions from companies, saying that the foundation complied with “accepted financial reporting standards.”The study’s authors said transparency could be improved by requiring the drug and device industries to report how much they donate to patient groups, much like they are already required to do with doctors.That was applauded by other critics of the drug industry. “I think sunshine is an excellent disinfectant,” said David Mitchell, the founder of a new group, Patients for Affordable Drugs, that seeks to lower drug prices, and does not take funding from industry groups. He was not involved in the study.Mr. Mitchell said patient groups often do not disclose that they take industry funds when they testify before Congress or government agencies, or when they disseminate educational information to patients.Many have also been silent on the issue of rising drug prices, even as the issue has enraged patients, who have been increasingly exposed to the prices that pharmaceutical companies set as insurers have asked them to pay a greater share of their drug costs. Last summer, patients and their families loudly protested the skyrocketing price of EpiPens, though the movement gathered steam on social media rather than through traditional patient-advocacy groups.And a year ago, for example, a representative for the National Psoriasis Foundation did not disclose that her group receives at least 40 percent of its annual revenues from drug companies when she testified before the North Carolina state legislature on an unsuccessful measure supported by the pharmaceutical industry that would have limited insurers’ ability to block coverage of certain drugs. Similarly, the hemophilia foundation did not disclose its pharmaceutical ties when it took the industry’s side in 2015 in a letter to the Food and Drug Administration over the issue of biosimilars, which are cheaper alternatives to complex biological drugs.

The Yeshiva University family mourns the passing of a cherished, long-time friend who, with her beloved husband, the late Louis Shapiro, was a YU Guardian who gave major support to Yeshiva University. Among their many contributions were the establishment of a large Reading Room in the Mendel Gottesman Library, Scholarship Funds in their honor and in tribute to several friends, and sponsorship of Yeshiva College publications, and of the annual Mishnayos Bekiyus Competition of the YU High School for Boys. Her kindness and compassion, and bravery in the face of adversity, made her a true "Ayshet Chayil". Heartfelt condolences are extended to her children, Martin (and Pat) Shapiro, Harvey Shapiro, Sheila (and Mark) Rosler, her grandchildren, and her great granddaughter. May the entire family be comforted among the mourners of Zion and Jerusalem. Yeshiva University Richard M. Joel, President Norman Lamm, Chancellor Morry J. Weiss, Chairman Board of Trustees

1890	 2008	a	City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. released an audit on Tuesday morning finding that the Police Department’s Manhattan Property Clerk Division had “exhibited disturbingly poor controls over weapons in its custody — with many of them initially missing.”The audit “found a stunning lack of organization, order and control,” Mr. Thompson said at a news conference in Lower Manhattan.The Property Clerk Division safeguards property, including cash, narcotics, rifles and handguns. The property is categorized as arrest evidence, materials kept for investigative or safekeeping purposes, and the property of deceased individuals.The department has established five Property Clerk Division offices, one in each borough, to accept and safeguard the property in custody. This audit focused on the Manhattan office and its controls over cash and firearms recovered from the 1999 to 2007 fiscal years.The 33-page audit [pdf] found the handling of cash to be adequate, but identified problems in the handling of firearms:Officials could not immediately account for or retrieve from storage 94 of the 324 sampled firearms brought in for safekeeping, even after several weeks.The office failed to record pertinent information that would permit easy tracking of the firearms in its custody. For instance, logbooks were incomplete or had inaccurate information.Rifles were stored “in a disheveled manner,” on the floor and in piles; some lacked identifying tags.Firearms were kept by the office longer than required by police regulations, which require that firearms be reclaimed or disposed of after one year.The office couldn’t accurately account for the number of firearms in its custody, since there are no written police procedures governing firearm inventories.The division does not maintain an electronic database of property, relying on manual records. But the Police Department has chosen a contractor to build a Property Evidence Tracking System.“It’s disgraceful that the N.Y.P.D. has let its weapons go AWOL,” Mr. Thompson said in a statement, adding, “Based on these conditions, there is limited assurance that firearms brought to the Manhattan P.C.D. office are safe, secure, and out of harms way.”The audit made several recommendations, including revamping the rifle storage area; making sure that firearms are destroyed after a year, as the law requires; immediately creating an inventory of the firearms in the Manhattan office; creating written procedures that govern the tracking and proper return or destruction of firearms.In a written response to the audit, Deputy Chief John P. Gerrish, the commander of the Office of Management Analysis and Planning at the Police Department, said he was “gratified” that the handling of cash was found to be adequate. He added, in part:As for firearms, it is important to note that every firearm was also accounted for, albeit the fact that some required a prolonged effort to locate, given the fact that firearms may at times be removed from their original storage position for court appearances, destruction, etc.Chief Gerrish said the department hoped to implement an automated tracking system for all property and had explored replacing the current fixed-shelving system with a “movable shelving system” that would increase storage capacity by as much as 60 percent.Chief Gerrish said the department agreed with, or had already begun to address, all 13 of Mr. Thompson’s recommendations.

1656	 2009	a	Barack Obama — unlike the other five presidents my colleagues and I are discussing on this blog — must contend with a worrisome new feature in American politics: the trivialization of the filibuster in the Senate. A simple majority vote no longer suffices to pass major pieces of legislation. Instead, in almost every case, the Senate must muster at least 60 votes (a “supermajority”) to close off debate. And because of a rule the Senate adopted relating to deficit spending, it took another 60 votes to pass the stimulus package last month.Once the tool of Southern segregationists, unending debate has become as acceptable as it is undemocratic.Historically, the filibuster was a last-ditch tactic used by an obstructionist minority to prevent passage of a bill by taking advantage of Senate rules that permitted unlimited debate. A measure would simply be “talked to death.” It was widely regarded as misuse of the rules, and was used sparingly. The origin of the word “filibuster” reflected its outlaw status. It was first applied to buccaneers in the West Indies who preyed on Spanish commerce to South America. According to Webster’s, a filibusterer was “a freebooter or soldier of fortune against a foreign country with which his own country is at peace.”In the entire 19th century, including the struggle against slavery, fewer than two dozen filibusters were mounted. In F.D.R.’s time, the device was employed exclusively by Southerners to block passage of federal anti-lynching legislation. Between 1933 and the coming of the war, it was attempted only twice. Under Eisenhower and J.F.K., the pattern continued. In the eight years of the Eisenhower administration, only two filibusters were mounted. Under Kennedy there were four. The number more than doubled under Lyndon Johnson, but the primary issue continued to be civil rights. Except for exhibitionists, buffoons and white southerners determined to salvage racial segregation, the filibuster was considered off limits.But with the enactment of major civil rights legislation in the 1960s and ’70s, the issue of equality for African-Americans faded from the Senate’s agenda, and the filibuster shed its racist image. Increasingly senators of all ideological persuasions began to consider the filibuster an acceptable weapon. By the time of the Carter and Reagan administrations, the frequency of filibusters had increased to 20 per year. “Filibusters are a necessary evil,” said Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia said in 1988. “They must be tolerated lest the Senate lose its special strength and become a mere appendage to the House of Representatives.”It was during the Clinton years that the dam broke. In the 103rd Congress (1993-1994), 32 filibusters were employed to kill a variety of presidential initiatives ranging from campaign finance reform to grazing fees on federal land. Between 1999 and 2007, the number of Senate filibusters varied between 20 and 37 per session, a bipartisan effort.So ingrained has the filibuster become, that in 2005 when Senate Majority Leader William Frist talked about amending the Senate’s rules to ban filibusters on judicial nominations, the move was universally dubbed the “nuclear option,” evoking images of Armageddon and total destruction.The routine use of the filibuster as a matter of everyday politics has transformed the Senate’s legislative process from majority rule into minority tyranny. Leaving party affiliation aside, it is now possible for the senators representing the 34 million people who live in the 21 least populous states — a little more than 11 percent of the nation’s population — to nullify the wishes of the representatives of the remaining 88 percent of Americans.It will be argued that the Senate, with two senators per state, has never been based on majoritarian principles. But look at the record. Congress, like the British Houses of Parliament, was designed to reflect two distinct bases of representation. In Britain, with rigid social and economic stratification, representation hewed to class lines. The House of Commons reflected the interests of the population generally; the House of Lords that of the aristocracy. In the United States the House represented the interests of the people, and the Senate reflected the will of the states. Until the adoption of the Constitution’s 17th Amendment in 1913, United States senators were elected by state legislatures. Indeed, senators were considered representatives of state governments, not the people. Equality among the states had been the basis of union in 1787, and for that reason it may have been justifiable to afford a significant number of states a veto over national policy.But with the direct popular election of senators, all of that changed. Senators no longer represented state governments, they represented the people. The rationale for providing states a veto through the use of the filibuster no longer obtained.In 1917, with two-thirds of the Senate having been elected by popular vote, the first dilution of the absolute authority of the filibuster was achieved. The Senate adopted Rule 22 to permit cloture to be imposed (limiting debate) if two-thirds of the Senate agreed. The Times wrote, “It is difficult to overestimate the importance of the new rule, both in measures of immediate interest and on the general course of legislation.”But invoking cloture proved difficult. Between 1919 and 1960, 23 attempts to close off debate were mounted, and only four were successful. In 1975, Rule 22 was amended to allow 60 senators, three-fifths of the Senate, to close off debate. The results have been better, but not markedly so. In the 108th Congress (2003-2004), cloture was attempted 49 times and was successful only12. What is more disheartening is the growing frequency with which the filibuster has been resorted to. In the most recent Congress, 112 filibusters were mounted, and 51 were successful.Thus far the Obama administration has had better luck. But it has been touch and go. With 57 Democrats, and two Independents and a few Republicans willing to side with the majority, the Senate has invoked cloture four out of the four times it has been required.Nevertheless, the use of the filibuster as an everyday tool of legislation stands the idea of democratic government on its head. Instead of majority rule in the Senate, the tyranny of the minority prevails. If the ability of the British House of Lords to prevent passage of legislation has been curtailed, surely it is time to permit a simple majority of the United States Senate to close off debate.In the great legislative reapportionment cases of the 1960s, the Supreme Court defined democratic government as majority rule based on the principle of one person, one vote. It is time to apply that standard to the Senate.
2898	 2002	a	It is one of the most arresting images ever made by a war photographer. A soldier is carried on a stretcher toward medical personnel who are calmly preparing to attend to his injuries. But the operating table, the gowned and masked nurses and surgeon, the stretcher carrier are all standing in water, and the operating room is enclosed in a mosquito-netting tent in the middle of a mangrove swamp. A nurse draws aside the flap of the tent, whose fluttery lines complement the delicate hanging tendrils and other vegetation. Natural light illuminates the table and hits the swirls of water around the approaching medic.In haunting unreality and beauty, this picture surpasses Robert Capa's 1943 image of British surgeons working shirtless in a church in Sicily. Unlike Capa, who is internationally famous, Vo Anh Khanh is not much known even in his own country, Vietnam. He took the picture in 1970 in a Vietcong haven in the southern Mekong Delta, didn't think much of it and never printed it.His image is one of more than 100 black-and-white photographs in ''Another Vietnam: Pictures of the War From the Other Side'' at the International Center of Photography. The exhibition, a collaboration with the National Geographic Society, offers a rare, comprehensive look at how Vietnamese photographers who found common cause with the Communists recorded the conflict.Mr. Khanh, now in his early 60's, was one of 30 surviving war photographers whom Doug Niven, the show's curator, tracked down during more than 20 trips to Vietnam. An American news photographer, he began his search after he went to Cambodia in the early 1990's and saw handmade black-and-white postcards of the war.
7488	 1964	a	A major coffee importing group yesterday threw its weight behind the contention of seven European steamship companies that they have a right to participate in the movement of beans to the United States.The Green Coffee Association of New York wired Thomas Mann, Assistant Secretary for American Affairs in the State Department, to protest a Brazilian Government ruling that would limit "third flag carriers" to 20 per cent of the coffee traffic. The regulation, scheduled to become effective today, would automatically allocate 80 per cent of the traffic to United States flag lines and the Brazilian national line, Lloyd Brazileiro. Lloyd would get 40 per cent.The Brazilian regulation promises to develop into one of considerable international proportion, since the European carriers consider it a “discriminatory” measure which affronts the traditional concept of “freedom of the seas.” One of the Norwegian companies involved, Nopal Line, has carried almost 30 per cent of the coffee traffic to United States Gulf ports.Protects Brazil LineThe measure was designed to protect Lloyd Brazileiro, which according to maritime and coffee trade sources, has heretofore enjoyed a minor share in the traffic due to inadequacies such as an infrequent service.

3863	 1997	a	Once upon a time people thought Joe Namath was a long-haired rebel.Today, the 54-year-old, happily married father of two girls had advice for the Jets' most controversial player, Keyshawn Johnson: apologize to Wayne Chrebet.Asked to respond to Namath's suggestion, Johnson said no.Some of Namath's controversies during the 1960's seem quaint now -- sporting a Fu Manchu mustache, donning pantyhose for a commercial. There was, however, a more painful period for Namath when he briefly retired after refusing to sell his interest in a restaurant, Bachelors III, that the National Football League security office believed was a hangout of alleged mob figures.The controversy swirling around Johnson's book appears to be lingering longer than its sales. In ''Just Give Me the Damn Ball!'' the receiver described his rookie season in passages interspersed with capital letters and bold face and italic sentences, and he called Chrebet the team mascot and suggested he would have a hard time making other teams. There were also passages of grudging praise for Chrebet, the workmanlike receiver from Hofstra University.''If, in fact, he did say that Chrebet couldn't play for any other team in the N.F.L., Keyshawn better look in the mirror or listen to somebody,'' Namath said. ''He's got to understand he's wrong.''

6168	 1976	a	Silver Beach is a waterside ‘community tucked into the eastern tip of the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx where residents seem satisfied—with apparent justification—that they have found an ideal way to preserve and improve their neighborhood.They bought it.While the 452 single‐family homes in Silver Beach have long been privately owned, the land they occupied had been owned, since 1921 by a family‐run real‐estate company. The home owners paid ground rent for the jots.Three years ago this month, the residents formed a cooperative and bought—for $1.6 million—the 50 acres on which their homes are built. 36 adjacent acres that extend under water into the East River, two miles of paths, three miles of roads, nine generally rundown commercial buildings, seven of them vacant, and a used and ramshackle firehouse.Three years after the undertaking, the residents seem content that they have firm control of their neighborhood's future. The complaints heard in other communities over reduced city services and other problems seem hard to come by in *Silver Beach.
1487	 2010	a	Hiroko Masuike for The New York TimesIntroduced on Wednesday: 2011 Hyundai Sonata Turbo (and Hybrid)Is it real? Yes, but in the “believe-it-when-I-drive-it” category. We will wait until it arrives in showrooms in late 2010 to do anything but quote the Hyundai-supplied power claims.What they said: “We’re not fans of compromising at Hyundai, and the Sonata really demonstrates this aspect of our business approach,” said Jon Krafcik, president and chief executive of Hyundai Motor America.What they didn’t say: The Sonata will use 4-cylinder engines of somewhat questionable provenance to compete in classes dominated by those offering V-6s.Hiroko Masuike for The New York TimesWhat makes it tick? A twin-scroll turbocharged 2-liter direct-injection 4-cylinder producing 274 horsepower and 269 foot-pounds of torque. Hyundai claims the Sonata Turbo will also get 34 miles per gallon fuel economy on the highway and run on 87 octane regular unleaded. Would you believe a hybrid version with a 2.4-liter, 169-horsepower 4-cylinder and a 40-horsepower electric motor (turned by lithium-something batteries), good for 37 city/39 highway? I’ll believe that when I see that, too.How much? How soon? This fall, at a price still to be dreamed up.How does it look? Busy. A mix between a Mercedes-Benz C-Class and a Lexus ES.

4473	 1993	a	That's when he reached into his mental file, and pulled out a winning shot."That restart, to myself, it made me think of my first 500-mile victory," Fittipaldi said. "It was in Michigan in 1985, when there was one lap to go and they put on the green, and I had Al Unser Sr. right on my gearbox."He used the same technique Sunday that he used then, and it worked just as well."When I approached Turn 3, I left a big gap to the pace car," he said. "I slowed down to second gear, more than normally you should do. And when I looked in the mirror, I saw Arie and Nigel leaving a gap, waiting to jump on the start."And then I slowed down even more, to build that gap. And when I saw that happen, I put the power down." The Right TiresThat left Luyendyk and Mansell eating dust in the drag race to the final green flag.Fittipaldi's car was ready for all this because of time spent on the driving range -- in this case, the second week of practice at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. "He worked all week that second week picking his race tires," Penske explained.After getting into the lineup on the first weekend of qualifying, Fittipaldi and his teammate, Paul Tracy of Canada, spent the next few days picking the eight sets of tires and air-pressure settings that made their cars handle best. And they restricted their practice to the same midday hours when the race would be run, so their cars would be set up for the weather during the race.At least two other drivers, Andretti and Al Unser Jr., were knocked out of contention Sunday by poor tire selection.Preparation can't replace experience, as the 24-year-old Tracy demonstrated on lap 95 when he tried too hard to pass Scott Brayton in Turn 3. Brayton moved down on Tracy, and Brayton's rear wheels clipped the nose of Tracy's car, which slid into the wall.

2866	 2002	a	Romano Prodi, now president of the European Commission, was prime minister when Italy was struggling to win acceptance into the euro club. He remembers how Italian interest rates were two and three times the German rates. He remembers how top German officials initially treated Italy's ambitions as almost laughable.But Italy did make it into the club. It cut its deficit, stabilized its exchange rate and brought down its inflation to German levels. As investors became more confident in Italy, interest rates on Italian bonds dropped to some of the lowest levels in history. That reduced Italy's huge interest rate payments and helped bring down the deficit even more.''For me, as an Italian, the euro is pure joy,'' Mr. Prodi said in an interview.It is easy to forget, and even many Europeans do, that the euro has existed since Jan. 1, 1999. That was when Germany, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Austria, Finland and the Netherlands officially locked their national currencies together and created the euro as a new combined currency. Greece joined the group two years later. Britain, Denmark and Sweden have stayed out.To be sure, the euro has been a disappointment to those who expected it to challenge the dominance of the dollar. In the three years leading up to the introduction of euro notes and coins, the euro has not eroded the dollar's position as an international reserve currency. It has not brought Europe's economic growth up to that of the United States.And even now, when the American economy is in recession, the euro has not become a safe haven for international investors. The dollar still accounts for 68 percent of the reserve currencies held by governments around the world, while the euro accounts for only 13 percent.The shaky confidence of investors about Europe is etched clearly on the value of the euro: still down about one-fifth against the dollar since 1999, the euro is worth about 90 cents.Another example of the euro's impact is in changing the ground rules for doing business, including the way companies raise money.

Leave a suggestion in the comments section.He was “a cross between a choir boy and a beatnik,” a 20-year-old with a voice “anything but pretty” when Bob Dylan came to the attention of a Times music critic.

1381	 2011	a	Patrick Mcdermott/Getty ImagesThere’s a stereotype of tennis — fair or not — that it is a gentlemen’s sport. The players, like the game itself, are supposed to be polite and mild-mannered individuals with affluent backgrounds.Alex Bogomolov is not like that. And he knows it.“I grew up differently,” he said. “I’m not the uptight tennis player most people think of.”Bogomolov, who lost in men’s doubles Thursday, will take the court again Friday against Rogerio Dutra da Silva of Brazil in the second round of men’s singles. He defeated Steve Johnson, with whom he has played doubles in the past, in the first round Wednesday.“I didn’t do too many things well besides mentally give myself a chance to stay in the match,” Bogomolov said. “The good thing is, I always fight through the adversity.”That resiliency is rooted in his upbringing. Russian immigrants, his family did not live the lavish lifestyle his tennis peers enjoyed. Instead, he had a passionate father, also named Alex, who was a prominent tennis player in the Soviet Union and went on to become a successful coach.When he was 9, the Bogomolovs moved to Mexico, then two years later to Miami, where Bogomolov Sr. ran a tennis academy.Bogomolov Jr. and his sister also took to tennis and were coached by their father, and his sister’s traveling schedule led Bogomolov Sr. to go on the road much of the year. To continue developing as a player, an 11-year-old Bogomolov was sent to Brooklyn to work with a friend of his father. Over the next decade, Bogomolov spent half the year in Brooklyn and the other half in Miami, honing his game.In New York, Bogomolov and his friends attended the Open each summer but never paid for a ticket; they would find a way to sneak in. The group would look for fights, and at 16, Bogomolov landed in a holding cell after he was arrested for fighting at the Port Washington Tennis Academy. Still, Bogomolov takes pride in his upbringing.“I feel like everybody wanted to prove to the others that we got each other’s backs,” Bogomolav said. “It was just the way it was.”Bogomolov’s resiliency has been tested more than in just Wednesday’s match.First, there was the pressure of not living up to the expectations as a top junior player.Then there was a messy divorce from the tennis player Ashley Harkleroad, whom he married when he was 21 and divorced two years later.“I was in debt for a long time because of it,” he said. “I would have a good result, pay off some of the debt, then not do so well. I never had any momentum.”Another blow came in 2008. During an event in South Korea, Bogomolov fell on his wrist, but felt no pain and went on to win the match. He woke up the next day unable to move the wrist. A doctor’s visit revealed he had torn ligaments.“It was like a knockout punch,” Bogomolov said.Bogomolov was told he might never be able to use a two-handed backhand again. Then came a break that he said changed his life. A week after returning from Korea, he met Luana Goncalves at a car convention in Miami. The two remained in contact and in the week leading up to his surgery in January 2009 he stayed in New Jersey with Goncalves, who moved to the United States from Brazil as a child.After surgery, Bogomolov took a job as a consultant for a tennis academy in New York with hopes of getting back on the court. But rehabbing did not go as well as expected, and he could not hit a ball without pain.Then he got some unexpected news.“I came back from work one day and she told me she was pregnant,” Bogomolov said of Goncalves. “A week after that, I was hitting full-on backhands. It was a miracle because before that I couldn’t even hit a backhand.”With another mouth to feed, Bogomolov knew he had to get back on the court to make some money.“He realized that it was now or never,” Goncalves said.Three months later, in June 2009, he was back on tour. He lost in last year’s United States Open qualifying tournament, but qualified for every Grand Slam event this year, advancing to the third round of Wimbledon in June. At 28, when most players are on the decline, Bogomolov is now ranked 44th, the highest in his career.He credits his son, Maddox, now 20 months old, and Goncalves for putting him in line.“I don’t get out of hand like I used to,” he said. “After a loss, I would get drunk and depressed. With her it was a big issue we had to change. Right away she changed that. She wouldn’t let me do that. I would pout and she would tell me to change my mentality.”

2022	 2007	a	This is Alice Mathias somehow magically reporting for a not-student-run news organization from the trenches of my senior spring at Dartmouth College. For the past four years, I have been studying in a safe, town-sized bubble in the New Hampshire wilderness, and on June 10th this bubble is scheduled to burst, at which point, along with (most of) the class of 2007, I will be catapulted into adulthood.When we were kids, my friends and I played a game called MASH. This game forecast whether we would grow up to live in Mansions, Apartments, Shacks, or Houses, what our jobs would be, where in the world we would live, which of our celebrity crushes we would marry, and most importantly, what kind of pet we would have. All we had to do was pick a number 1 through 10 and our destinies would unfold before our eyes. If we didn’t like these destinies, we could just play the game again.Back in our MASH days, our dream jobs were firefighting, I-banking, sales and trading, consulting, wealth management, mergers and acquisitions, and real estate finance. We wanted to live in the Upper East Side, the Upper West Side, Greenwich or Great Neck. We understood that if we failed to find true love after the first shot, we could marry/divorce every crush on our lists. The pet issue was the only one that was really up for grabs. (I’m still crossing my fingers for that designer Labradoodle.)O.K., fine –– no one actually knew what “I-banking” meant when we were kids. We still don’t understand the specifics, but roughly translated it means: “getting rich.” Whatever it is, a stunning percentage of my generation’s most promising brainiacs are doing it. They could be curing diseases or discovering alternative energy sources or living at their parents’ houses, but instead, they are making millions for the Man over at the bank-tank.The banker plague is spread by a phenomenon known as corporate recruiting. Every year, serious New York guys in coats and ties descend on college campuses and convince the smartest kids that the surefire way to afford a castle on the moon is by crunching numbers at places like J.P. Bored-Again, Bored-Again Stanley, Merrill Lynching, Deutsche Bag, or Lame-Man Brothers. The other option is to do consulting at Bane. (Note: these are fake names. Real names have been withheld to ward off any more competition for my well-paying job.)I-Banking would seem to be a suitable ambition for I-vy League members of what has been coined the “I-Generation” for more reasons than are initially apparent. (The I-thing!) Sure, we all want to be able to buy iPods for our kids or celebrity spouses or designer pets. Yes, the Internet has made us realize that there is a lot of competition out there for hip apartments and e-Bay’s limited edition “Virgin Mary’s Face in a Grilled Cheese Sandwich.” All that said, I don’t think that the class of 2007’s huge population of econ majors is a direct symptom of our insatiable appetite for “stuff” (that edible relic would surely be filling enough).I respect my many bank-bent peers who feel the need to make a lot of money for one glaringly freaky reason. In a speech to first-year Dartmouth students, an engineering professor who was lecturing about genetics said (with a completely straight face): “it is completely conceivable that [his generation] is among the last of generations to ever experience natural biological aging and death.” Basically this not-joking genius told everyone that, thanks (or no thanks) to science, the class of 2007 might be (drum roll please) I-mmortal! (No, not the baddum-ching kind of drum roll. This is not a joke: we might get really, freakishly old.)All we’ll have to do is pop a few fountain-of-youth geltabs at night before brushing our teeth, and eternity will be ours. The only catch is that we will still have to outrun those “unnatural” causes of aging and death.My class is graduating into a world that is changing faster than ever before. We’re living in a weird society today that will most assuredly be weirder tomorrow. By the time my generation takes over the reins, we’ll be steering an entirely different pony. Probably a robotic pony. (Oops! That Labradoodle just got bucked off my wish list.)Being a citizen led by a contentious bipartisan government is like being the child of divorced parents (something that my generation knows a lot about.) As ordinary civilians, we are the nearly powerless witnesses to a lot of problem-pushing and finger-pointing. There is a big split, but no matter what, we are somehow still a family.The class of 2007 has grown up trying to reconcile Papa Bush’s crusade against terrorism with Mama Gore’s videotaped PowerPoints insisting that global warming is a bigger threat to our well-being. The “adults” have instructed us to prepare for attacks and floods and polar bear holocausts. These competitors for our affection all trumpet different versions of Armageddon and seem to agree on just one thing: that the kids aren’t going to be safe.Hurricane Katrina and the war in Iraq have underscored the notion that money is the common citizen’s only viable safety net. It doesn’t take an econ major to recognize basic applications of supply and demand. When helicopter rides out of danger zones become limited, they go to the rich. When the American Army finds itself with limited resources, it goes to the poor. If my classmates and I are going to live forever, we can expect to face many natural and man-made disasters. If these problems are not somehow avoided, it seems they will be escaped only by those who can afford a one-way ticket to that castle on the moon.We won’t need to worry about not being immortal if we can elect the right leadership. For as long as I can remember, I have been moving back and forth between the Bush and Clinton White Houses. My peers and I know no other presidents. The family ideals of America’s Montagues and Capulets have trickled down and shaped the graduating class that we are today –– that is, they have shaped us into a class that is, by and large, turned off by the idea of growing up to be politicians. All the smartest kids in the room have instead elected to go Mr. Moneybags à la Monopoly.I don’t mean to make an all-encompassing declaration of doom. The truth is that many of my clever peers have snuck through the corporate cracks and will ideally make a big difference in other arenas of society, maybe even in politics. Things are already looking up. Somehow the Democrats have recently found a smart guy who is miraculously dumb enough to want to be president. He’s hip, too. Maybe he’ll start a smart-politician trend. If he doesn’t manage to sway intelligent young people into pursuing politics, at least we can count on him to inspire political engagement in the crush category of MASH games across America.
